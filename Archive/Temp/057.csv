A total of 97 patients received treatment in our center between 2007 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Patients were divided into two arms according to the post-remission therapy (chemotherapy alone or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)) they received. MRD was detected by four-color flow cytometry. We chose 0.02% and 0.2% as the cut-off points of MRD at CR1 for risk stratification using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) rates for the whole cohort were 46.2% and 40.5%. MRD at CR1 had a significantly negative correlation with survival in both arms. Three-year OS rates in the chemotherapy arm were 70.0%, 25.2%, 0% (P = 0.003) for low, intermediate, and high levels of MRD at CR1, respectively. Three-year OS rates in the transplant arm were 81.8%, 64.3%, 27.3% (P = 0.005) for low, intermediate, and high levels of MRD at CR1, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that higher level of MRD at CR1 was a significant adverse factor for OS and LFS. Compared with chemotherapy alone, allo-HSCT significantly improved LFS rates in patients with intermediate (P = 0.005) and high (P = 0.022) levels of MRD at CR1, but not patients with low level of MRD at CR1 (P = 0.851). These results suggested that MRD at CR1 could strongly predict the outcome of adult ALL. Patients with intermediate and high levels of MRD at CR1 would benefit from allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Mingming', 'Fu, Huarui', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Zheng, Weiyan', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Zhao, Yanmin', 'Lin, Maofang', 'He, Jingsong', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Luo, Yi', 'Huang, He']","['Zhang M', 'Fu H', 'Lai X', 'Tan Y', 'Zheng W', 'Shi J', 'Zhao Y', 'Lin M', 'He J', 'Cai Z', 'Luo Y', 'Huang H']","[""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', '*Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC5047486,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/10/04 06:00,2017/06/28 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0163599 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-21420 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Oct 3;11(10):e0163599. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163599. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify new susceptibility loci for the largest subtype of ALL, B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), we conducted a meta-analysis of two GWASs with imputation using 1000 Genomes and UK10K Project data as reference (totaling 1658 cases and 7224 controls). After genotyping an additional 2525 cases and 3575 controls, we identify new susceptibility loci for BCP-ALL mapping to 10q26.13 (rs35837782, LHPP, P=1.38 x 10(-11)) and 12q23.1 (rs4762284, ELK3, P=8.41 x 10(-9)). We also provide confirmatory evidence for the existence of independent risk loci at 9p21.3, but show that the association marked by rs77728904 can be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with the rare high-impact CDKN2A p.Ala148Thr variant rs3731249.

Recurrent genomic rearrangements are detected in half of pediatric AML by karyotype. NUcleoPorin 98 (NUP98) gene is rearranged with 31 different fusion partner genes. These rearrangements are frequently undetected by conventional cytogenetics, as the NUP98 gene is located at the end of the chromosome 11 short arm (11p15). By screening a series of 574 pediatric AML, we detected a NUP98 rearrangement in 22 cases (3.8%), a frequency similar to CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene (4.0%). The most frequent NUP98 fusion gene partner is NSD1. These cases are homogeneous regarding their biological and clinical characteristics, and associated with bad prognosis only improved by bone marrow transplantation. We detailed the biological characteristics of these AML by exome sequencing which demonstrated few recurrent mutations (FLT3 ITD, WT1, CEBPA, NBPF14, BCR and ODF1). The analysis of the clonal structure in these cases suggests that the mutation order in the NUP98-rearranged pediatric AML begins with the NUP98 rearrangement leading to epigenetic dysregulations then followed by mutations of critical hematopoietic transcription factors and finally, activation of the FLT3 signaling pathway.","['Struski, S', 'Lagarde, S', 'Bories, P', 'Puiseux, C', 'Prade, N',

Strikingly, all hyperhaploid karyotypes were found to harbor monosomy 17p, the single most important risk stratification lesion in MM. A catastrophic loss of nearly a haploid set of chromosomes results in disomies of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 19 and 21, the same basic set of odd-numbered chromosomes found in trisomy in hyperdiploid myeloma. All other autosomes are found in monosomy, resulting in additional clinically relevant monosomies of 1p, 6q, 13q and 16q. Hypotriploid subclones (58-68 chromosomes) were also identified in 11 of the 33 patients and represent a duplication of the hyperhaploid clone. Analysis of clones utilizing interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH), metaphase FISH and spectral karyotyping identified either monosomy 17 or del17p in all patients. Amplification of 1q21 was identified in eight patients, demonstrating an additional high-risk marker. Importantly, our findings indicate that current iFISH strategies may be uninformative or ambiguous in the detection of these clones, suggesting this patient subgroup maybe underreported.

However, the mechanisms by which combinatory mutations in epigenetic regulators promote the development of MDS remain unknown. Here we performed epigenomic profiling of hematopoietic progenitors in MDS mice hypomorphic for Tet2 following the loss of the polycomb-group gene Ezh2 (Tet2(KD/KD)Ezh2(Delta/Delta)). Aberrant DNA methylation propagated in a sequential manner from a Tet2-insufficient state to advanced MDS with deletion of Ezh2. Hyper-differentially methylated regions (hyper-DMRs) in Tet2(KD/KD)Ezh2(Delta/Delta) MDS hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were largely distinct from those in each single mutant and correlated with transcriptional repression. Although Tet2 hypomorph was responsible for enhancer hypermethylation, the loss of Ezh2 induced hyper-DMRs that were enriched for CpG islands of polycomb targets. Notably, Ezh2 targets largely lost the H3K27me3 mark while acquiring a significantly higher level of DNA methylation than Ezh1 targets that retained the mark. These findings indicate that Ezh2 targets are the major targets of the epigenetic switch in MDS with Ezh2 insufficiency. Our results provide a detailed trail for the epigenetic drift in a well-defined MDS model and demonstrate that the combined dysfunction of epigenetic regulators cooperatively remodels the epigenome in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Hasegawa, N', 'Oshima, M', 'Sashida, G', 'Matsui, H', 'Koide, S', 'Saraya, A', 'Wang, C', 'Muto, T', 'Takane, K', 'Kaneda, A', 'Shimoda, K', 'Nakaseko, C', 'Yokote, K', 'Iwama, A']","['Hasegawa N', 'Oshima M', 'Sashida G', 'Matsui H', 'Koide S', 'Saraya A', 'Wang C', 'Muto T', 'Takane K', 'Kaneda A', 'Shimoda K', 'Nakaseko C', 'Yokote K', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161003,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2016/10/22 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016268 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.268 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Apr;31(4):861-871. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.268.

Members of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulators contribute to oncogenic transformation downstream of these oncogenes, but the role of anti-apoptotic BCL2A1/A1 in transformation and drug resistance caused by deregulation of these oncogenes remains enigmatic. Here we analyzed the role of A1 in MYC as well as ABL kinase-driven blood cancer in mice, employing in vivo RNAi. We report that overexpression of either oncogene leads to a significant increase in A1 protein levels in otherwise A1-negative B cell progenitors, indicating a key role downstream of these oncogenes to secure survival during transformation. Knockdown of A1 by RNAi, however, did not impact on tumor latency in v-Abl-driven pre-B-ALL. In contrast, A1 knockdown in premalignant Emu-MYC mice caused a significant reduction of transgenic pre-B cells without impacting on tumor latency as the emerging lymphomas escaped silencing of A1 expression. These findings identify A1 as a MYC target that can be induced prematurely during B cell development to aid expansion of otherwise cell-death-prone MYC transgenic pre-B cells. Hence, A1 should be considered as a putative drug target in MYC-driven blood cancer.","['Sochalska, M', 'Schuler, F', 'Weiss, J G', 'Prchal-Murphy, M', 'Sexl, V', 'Villunger, A']","['Sochalska M', 'Schuler F', 'Weiss JG', 'Prchal-Murphy M', 'Sexl V', 'Villunger A']","['Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161003,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/*genetics']",PMC5395700,,2016/10/04 06:00,2017/04/20 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016362 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.362 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Apr;36(15):2066-2073. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.362.

However, the role of HPIP in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unknown. Here we report that HPIP is upregulated in most RCC patients, positively correlates with tumor size, high Fuhrman grade and preoperative metastasis, and predicts poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, we identified casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha), a critical regulator of tumorigenesis and metastasis, as a novel HPIP-interacting protein. HPIP facilitates RCC cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition depending on its interaction with CK1alpha. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathways by HPIP is partly dependent on CK1alpha and is required for HPIP modulation of RCC cell proliferation and migration. HPIP knockdown suppresses renal tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice through CK1alpha. Moreover, expression of CK1alpha is positively correlated with HPIP in RCC samples, and also predicts poor clinical outcome-like expression of HPIP. Taken together, our data demonstrate the critical regulatory role of the HPIP-CK1alpha interaction in RCC, and suggest that HPIP and CK1alpha may be potential targets for RCC therapy.","['Mai, H', 'Xu, X', 'Mei, G', 'Hong, T', 'Huang, J', 'Wang, T', 'Yan, Z', 'Li, Y', 'Liang, Y', 'Li, L', 'Jin, S', 'You, W', 'Ma, Y', 'Chen, L', 'Ye, Q']","['Mai H', 'Xu X', 'Mei G', 'Hong T', 'Huang J', 'Wang T', 'Yan Z', 'Li Y', 'Liang Y', 'Li L', 'Jin S', 'You W', 'Ma Y', 'Chen L', 'Ye Q']","[""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161003,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,PMC5117846,,2016/10/04 06:00,2016/10/04 06:01,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/04 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201644 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2016.44 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2016 Oct 3;5(10):e260. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2016.44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in KIT, most frequently KIT D816V, are detected in over 80% of all systemic mastocytosis patients. While most systemic mastocytosis patients suffer from an indolent disease variant, some present with more aggressive variants, collectively called ""advanced systemic mastocytosis"", which include aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic, clonal non mast cell-lineage disease, and mast cell leukemia. Whereas patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis have a near normal life expectancy, patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis have a reduced life expectancy. Although cladribine and interferon-alpha are of benefit in a group of patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, no curative therapy is available for these patients except possible allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent studies have also revealed additional somatic defects (apart from mutations in KIT) in a majority of patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis. These include TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, RUNX1, JAK2, and/or RAS mutations, which may adversely impact prognosis and survival in particular systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm. In addition, several additional signaling molecules involved in the abnormal proliferation of mast cells in systemic mastocytosis have been identified. These advances have led to a better understanding of the biology of advanced systemic mastocytosis and to the development of new targeted treatment concepts.

Through analysis of gene expression data, we provide evidence that the hedgehog pathway is activated in 20% of T-ALL samples. Hedgehog pathway activation is associated with ectopic expression of the hedgehog ligands Sonic hedgehog (SHH) or Indian hedgehog (IHH), and with upregulation of the transcription factor GLI1 Ectopic expression of SHH or IHH in mouse T cells in vivo caused hedgehog pathway activation in both lymphoid and epithelial cells in the thymus and resulted in increased expression of important T-cell stimulatory ligands (Dll4, Il7, and Vegf) by thymic epithelial cells. In T-ALL cell lines, pharmacological inhibition or short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SMO or GLI1 led to decreased cell proliferation. Moreover, primary T-ALL cases with high GLI1 messenger RNA levels, but not those with low or undetectable GLI1 expression, were sensitive to hedgehog pathway inhibition by GANT61 or GDC-0449 (vismodegib) using ex vivo cultures and in vivo xenograft models.

However, recurrent contact with CLL cells in a stromal microenvironment leads to increased aerobic glycolysis and the cells' overall glycolytic capacity, which promotes cell survival and proliferation. TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) has been directly implicated in cellular metabolism in the control of glycolysis. TIGAR inhibits glycolysis and protects cells from intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated apoptosis. METHODS: TIGAR mRNA expression was investigated by quantitative PCR in 102 newly diagnosed CLL patients. Furthermore, the relationship between the expression of TIGAR and its clinical characteristics and prognosis were investigated. Moreover, we also investigated the correlation between TIGAR expression and apoptosis in primary CLL cells. RESULTS: Our data revealed that TIGAR overexpression was correlated with the protection from spontaneous apoptosis in CLL cells, and is strongly associated with advanced Binet stage, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) status, CD38 positivity, beta2-microglobulin and p53 aberrations. Higher expression of TIGAR was associated with shorter treatment-free survival (median: three months vs. 51 months, P=0.0108), worse overall survival (median: 74 months vs. not reached, P=0.0242), and the diverse responses to fludarabine-based chemotherapy. TIGAR expression in patients resistant to chemotherapy was significantly higher than in patients sensitive to chemotherapy (mean: 0.3859+/-0.1710 vs. 0.0974+/-0.0291, P=0.0290). CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings revealed that high TIGAR expression is closely correlated with worse clinical outcome in CLL patients, and depicted how bioenergetic characteristics could be therapeutically exploited in CLL.","['Hong, Ming', 'Xia, Yi', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Zhao, Hui-Hui', 'Zhu, Han', 'Xie, Yue', 'Fan, Lei', 'Wang, Li', 'Miao, Kou-Rong', 'Yu, Hui', 'Miao, Yu-Qing', 'Wu, Wei', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Chen, Yao-Yu', 'Xu, Wei', 'Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Hong M', 'Xia Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhao HH', 'Zhu H', 'Xie Y', 'Fan L', 'Wang L', 'Miao KR', 'Yu H', 'Miao YQ', 'Wu W', 'Zhu HY', 'Chen YY', 'Xu W', 'Qian SX', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.

It is approved for use on fruit, vegetables and seed commodities in the EU and elsewhere to control fungi such as Ascomycetes, Fungi Imperfecti and, Basidiomycetes. Its widespread use has raised the issue of possible health risks for agrarian communities and the general population, which can be exposed to residues present in food and drinking water. The toxicities identified include adverse effects on liver and kidney and on the development of male reproductive organs. Since the liver is the first-line organ in the defense against xenobiotics, toxic effects on hepatic metabolism cause degeneration, necrosis, and tissue hypertrophy. Therefore, we investigated myclobutanil's effects on the human liver cell line HepG2. We found that myclobutanil increases the amount of fatty acids in these hepatic cells, as evaluated with Oil Red O staining, and progressively reduces cell viability from 1ppm to 500ppm. Analysis of biomarkers such as Bcl-xL/Bak and Mcl-1/Bak confirmed activation of cell death pathways at low doses. Therefore, myclobutanil may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic hepatocellular diseases in humans.","['Stellavato, Antonietta', 'Lamberti, Monica', 'Pirozzi, Anna Virginia Adriana', 'de Novellis, Francesca', 'Schiraldi, Chiara']","['Stellavato A', 'Lamberti M', 'Pirozzi AVA', 'de Novellis F', 'Schiraldi C']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Biotechnology, Medical Histology and Molecular Biology, Second University of Naples, Via de Crecchio 7, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Hygiene, Occupational Medicine and Forensic Medicine, Second University of Naples, Via de Crecchio 7, 80131 Naples, Italy.

In the present study, we describe the construction and use of an electrochemical DNA biosensor based on a nanostructured polyaniline-gold composite, specifically developed for the detection of the BCR/ABL chimeric oncogene. This chromosome translocation is used as a biomarker to confirm the clinical diagnosis of both chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The working principle of the biosensor rests on measuring the conductivity resulting from the non-covalent interactions between the hybrid nanocomposite and the DNA probe. The nanostructured platform exhibits a large surface area that enhances the conductivity. Positive cases, which result from the hybridization between DNA probe and targeted gene, induce changes in the amperometric current and in the charge transfer resistance (RCT) responses. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed changes in the genosensor surface after exposure to cDNA sample of patient with leukemia, evidencing the hybridization process. This new hybrid sensing-platform displayed high specificity and selectivity, and its detection limit is estimated to be as low as 69.4 aM. The biosensor showed excellent analytical performance for the detection of the BCR/ABL oncogene in clinical samples of patients with leukemia. Hence, this electrochemical sensor appears as a simple and attractive tool for the molecular diagnosis of the BCR/ABL oncogene even in early-stage cases of leukemia and for the monitoring of minimum levels of residual disease.","['Avelino, Karen Y P S', 'Frias, Isaac A M', 'Lucena-Silva, Norma', 'Gomes, Renan G', 'de Melo, Celso P', 'Oliveira, Maria D L', 'Andrade, Cesar A S']","['Avelino KYPS', 'Frias IAM', 'Lucena-Silva N', 'Gomes RG', 'de Melo CP', 'Oliveira MDL', 'Andrade CAS']","['Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Bioquimica e Fisiologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Inovacao Terapeutica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhaes, Fundacao Osvaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), 50670-420 Recife, PE, Brazil; Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Oncologia Pediatrica, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP), 50070-550 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhaes, Fundacao Osvaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), 50670-420 Recife, PE, Brazil; Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Oncologia Pediatrica, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP), 50070-550 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Fisica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Bioquimica e Fisiologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Inovacao Terapeutica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Bioquimica e Fisiologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Inovacao Terapeutica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE, Brazil.

Recently, revolutionized sequencing platforms have revealed frequent RHOA mutations in a wide variety of human cancers, including angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, germinal center B-cell lymphoma, diffuse-type gastric cancer, and other solid tumors. With their discrete positional distributions and types of amino acid substitution depending on cancer type, different RHOA mutations seem to have unique functional and biological properties. However, their impact on the development of different types of tumors remains controversial. Here, we present an overview of the current understanding of RHOA mutations in human cancers and highlight the unanticipated complexity of their genetic and biological properties.","['Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Kataoka K', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.

Traditionally, these so-called leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have been identified in the laboratory by their ability to engraft acute myeloid leukemia (AML) into immunocompromised mice. For many years, only those rare AML cells characterized by a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) CD34(+)CD38(-) phenotype were believed capable of generating leukemia in immunocompromised mice. However, more recently, significant heterogeneity in the phenotypes of those AML cells that can engraft immunocompromised mice has been demonstrated. AML cells that engraft immunocompromised mice have also been shown to not necessarily represent either the founder clone or those cells responsible for relapse. A recent study found that the most immature phenotype present in an AML correlated with genetically defined risk groups and outcomes, but was heterogeneous. Patients with AML cells expressing a primitive HSC phenotype (CD34(+)CD38(-) with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity) manifested significantly lower complete remission rates, as well as poorer event-free and overall survivals. Leukemias in which the most primitive cells displayed more mature phenotypes were associated with better outcomes. The strong clinical correlations suggest that the most immature phenotype detectable within a patient's AML might serve as a biomarker for ""clinically relevant"" LSCs.","['Yanagisawa, Breann', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Yanagisawa B', 'Ghiaur G', 'Smith BD', 'Jones RJ']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.

We examined clinical correlations and CALR mutation frequency in our myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) cases, and introduce an effective test method for use in clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 177 samples previously investigated for the JAK2 mutation for differential diagnosis of MPN. JAK2 and CALR mutations were analyzed using melting curve analysis and microchip electrophoresis, respectively. Next, we constructed a test for simultaneous screening of the JAK2 and CALR mutations utilizing high resolution melting (HRM). RESULTS: Among 99 MPN cases, 60 possessed the JAK2 mutation alone. Of the 39 MPN cases without the JAK2 mutation, 14 were positive for the CALR mutation, all of which were ET. Using our novel screening test for the JAK2 and CALR mutations by HRM, the concordance rate of conventional analysis with HRM was 96% for the JAK2 mutation and 95% for the CALR mutation. CONCLUSION: Our novel simultaneous screening test for the JAK2 and CALR gene mutations with HRM is useful for diagnosis of MPN.","['Matsumoto, Nariyoshi', 'Mori, Sayaka', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Mori, Hayato', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Kaku, Norihito', 'Kosai, Kousuke', 'Uno, Naoki', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori']","['Matsumoto N', 'Mori S', 'Hasegawa H', 'Sasaki D', 'Mori H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Imanishi D', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Hata T', 'Kaku N', 'Kosai K', 'Uno N', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yanagihara K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.

Patients with CLL also harbor variable numbers of CD5(low) B cells, but the clonal relationship of these cells to the bulk disease is unknown and can have important implications for monitoring, treating, and understanding the biology of CLL. Here, we use B-cell receptors (BCRs) as molecular barcodes to first show by single-cell BCR sequencing that the great majority of CD5(low) B cells in the blood of CLL patients are clonally related to CD5(high) CLL B cells. We investigate whether CD5 state switching was likely to occur continuously as a common event or as a rare event in CLL by tracking somatic BCR mutations in bulk CLL B cells and using them to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of the CLL in four patients. Using statistical methods, we show that there is no parsimonious route from a single or low number of CD5(low) switch events to the CD5(high) population, but rather, large-scale and/or dynamic switching between these CD5 states is the most likely explanation. The overlapping BCR repertoires between CD5(high) and CD5(low) cells from CLL patient peripheral blood reveal that CLL exists in a continuum of CD5 expression. The major proportion of CD5(low) B cells in patients are leukemic, thus identifying CD5(low) B cells as an important component of CLL, with implications for CLL pathogenesis, clinical monitoring, and the development of anti-CD5-directed therapies.","['Bashford-Rogers, Rachael J M', 'Palser, Anne L', 'Hodkinson, Clare', 'Baxter, Joanna', 'Follows, George A', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Kellam, Paul']","['Bashford-Rogers RJ', 'Palser AL', 'Hodkinson C', 'Baxter J', 'Follows GA', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Kellam P']","['Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank, University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, National Health Service Blood and Transplant Cambridge Centre, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank, University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, National Health Service Blood and Transplant Cambridge Centre, Cambridge, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK."", 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK; Research Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, UK.

ACPs kill cancer cells by causing irreparable membrane damage and cell lysis, or by inducing apoptosis. Direct-acting ACPs do not bind to a unique receptor, but are rather attracted to several different molecules on the surface of cancer cells. Here we report that an amidated wasp venom peptide, Mastoparan, exhibited potent anti-cancer activities toward leukemia (IC50~8-9.2muM), myeloma (IC50~11muM), and breast cancer cells (IC50~20-24muM), including multidrug resistant and slow growing cancer cells. Importantly, the potency and mechanism of cancer cell killing was related to the amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl group. Mastoparan was less toxic to normal cells than it was to cancer cells (e.g., IC50 to PBMC=48muM). Mastoparan killed cancer cells by a lytic mechanism. Moreover, Mastoparan enhanced etoposide-induced cell death in vitro. Our data also suggest that Mastoparan and gemcitabine work synergistically in a mouse model of mammary carcinoma. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Mastoparan is a broad-spectrum, direct-acting ACP that warrants additional study as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers.","['Hilchie, Ashley L', 'Sharon, Andrew J', 'Haney, Evan F', 'Hoskin, David W', 'Bally, Marcel B', 'Franco, Octavio L', 'Corcoran, Jennifer A', 'Hancock, Robert E W']","['Hilchie AL', 'Sharon AJ', 'Haney EF', 'Hoskin DW', 'Bally MB', 'Franco OL', 'Corcoran JA', 'Hancock REW']","['University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Departamento de Patologia Molecular, Universidade de Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Centro de Analises Proteomicas e Bioquimicas, Universidade, Catolica de Brasilia, DF, Brazil; S-Inova Biotech, Programa de Pos Graduacao em Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica Dom Bosco, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

In the lower-risk patients, Refractory Cytopenias with Multilineage Dysplasia and Ring Sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) has been separated from RCMD to recognize the importance of the SF3B1 mutation. Often there has been confusion as to the degree of morphologic dysplasia and/or cytopenias to define some of the lower-risk subtypes. In addition, the type of dysplasia or cytopenias is not always concordant. Therefore, it seems prudent to apply the more general term ""myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)"" with single- or multiple-lineage dysplasia. Refractory neutropenia or thrombocytopenia has been deemphasized because most patients have multilineage dysplasia. In the higher-risk patients, the terms Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts (RAEB) 1 or 2 have been simplified to Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Excess Blasts (MDS-EB) 1 or 2 to emphasize the importance of the percentage of blasts that dictate therapy. Patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) can be classified into 3 groups: CMML 0, 1, or 2, based on the percentage of blasts (< 5%, 5%-9%, 10%-19%). Cases with 50% or more erythroid precursors will not have the percentage of blasts based on the nonerythroid precursors. Previous cases of acute erythroid leukemia (myeloid:erythroid type) can be included in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtype: AML with MDS-related features.","['Bennett, John M']",['Bennett JM'],"['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Departments of Pathology and Medicine, James P.

OBJECTIVE: We carried out a population-based case-control study in a Northern Italy community to assess the possible relation between passive exposure to agricultural pesticides and risk of acute childhood leukemia. METHODS: We assessed passive pesticide exposure of 111 childhood leukemia cases and 444 matched controls by determining density and type of agricultural land use within a 100-m radius buffer around children's homes. We focused on four common crop types, arable, orchard, vineyard and vegetable, characterized by the use of specific pesticides that are potentially involved in childhood induced leukemia. The use of these pesticides was validated within the present study. We computed the odds ratios (OR) of the disease and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) according to type and density of crops around the children's homes, also taking into account traffic pollution and high-voltage power line magnetic field exposure. RESULTS: Childhood leukemia risk did not increase in relation with any of the crop types with the exception of arable crops, characterized by the use of 2.4-D, MCPA, glyphosate, dicamba, triazine and cypermethrin. The very few children (n=11) residing close to arable crops had an OR for childhood leukemia of 2.04 (95% CI 0.50-8.35), and such excess risk was further enhanced among children aged <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the null association with most crop types and the statistical imprecision of the estimates, the increased leukemia risk among children residing close to arable crops indicates the need to further investigate the involvement in disease etiology of passive exposure to herbicides and pyrethroids, though such exposure is unlikely to play a role in the vast majority of cases.","['Malagoli, Carlotta', 'Costanzini, Sofia', 'Heck, Julia E', 'Malavolti, Marcella', 'De Girolamo, Gianfranco', 'Oleari, Paola', 'Palazzi, Giovanni', 'Teggi, Sergio', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Malagoli C', 'Costanzini S', 'Heck JE', 'Malavolti M', 'De Girolamo G', 'Oleari P', 'Palazzi G', 'Teggi S', 'Vinceti M']","['Environmental, Genetic, and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center - CREAGEN, Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Engineering ""Enzo Ferrari"", University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Box 951772, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', 'Environmental, Genetic, and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center - CREAGEN, Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Unit of Epidemiology and Risk Communication, Local Health Unit of Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Information and Communication Technology Department, Local Health Unit of Reggio Emilia and IRCCS-Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Policlinico Hospital, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Engineering ""Enzo Ferrari"", University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Environmental, Genetic, and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center - CREAGEN, Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.

We aimed to assess the predictive value of PET-2 combined with tissue biomarkers in neoplastic and microenvironmental cells for this disease. METHODS: We enrolled 208 patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and treated with ABVD (training set), from Jan 1, 2002, to Dec 31, 2009, and validated the results in a fully matched independent cohort of 102 patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (validation set), enrolled from Jan 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2012. The inclusion criteria for both the training and validation sets were: the availability of a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample collected at diagnosis; treatment with ABVD with or without radiotherapy; baseline staging and interim restaging after two ABVD courses with FDG-PET; no treatment change based solely on interim PET result; and HIV-negative status. We used Cox multivariate analysis classification and regression tree (CART) to compare the predictive values of these markers with that of PET-2 and to assess the biomarkers' ability to correctly classify patients whose outcome was incorrectly predicted by PET-2. FINDINGS: In multivariate analysis, PET-2 was the only factor able to predict both progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 33.3 [95% CI 13.6-83.3]; p<0.0001) and overall survival (HR 31.3 [95% CI 3.7-58.9]; p=0.002). In the training set, no factor had a stronger adverse predictive value than a positive PET-2 scan and none was able to correctly reclassify PET-2 positive patients. In PET-2 negative patients, expression of CD68 (>/=25%) and PD1 (diffuse or rosetting pattern) in microenvironmental cells, and STAT1 negativity in Hodgkin Reed Sternberg cells identified a subset of PET-2 negative patients with a 3 year progression-free survival significantly lower than that of the remaining PET-2 negative population (21 [64%] of 33 [95% CI 45.2-79.0] vs 130 [95%] of 137 [95% CI 89.4-97.7]; p<0.0001). These findings were reproduced in the validation set. INTERPRETATION: The CART algorithm correctly predicted the response to treatment in more than a half of patients who had a relapse or disease progression despite a negative PET-2 scan, thus increasing the negative predictive value of PET-2. In keeping with preliminary results from interim PET response adapted clinical trials of patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, there might be a non-negligible proportion of treatment failures in the interim PET negative group treated with standard ABVD.

Data focusing on long-term effects are available, but little is known with regard to the short-term perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess muscle strength performance and quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents with cancer at the beginning of primary treatment. Forty children and adolescents aged 5-18 years (mean: 11.39 +/- 4.08 years) with different types of childhood cancer were enrolled. On average 36 +/- 20.5 days after diagnosis, strength performance in 7 muscle groups was assessed by handheld dynamometry. KINDL questionnaires were completed to evaluate QoL (children's self-report and parents' report). All parameters were compared with age- and gender-matched reference values. Patients with childhood cancer showed significantly lower strength values in all muscle groups (P < .01) compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Most affected were the lower extremities, with a -57.1% +/- 10.4%, median: -59.2%, minimum: -75.4%, maximum: -41.4% percentage deviation in knee flexion from healthy peers. Children themselves and parents assessed total QoL significantly below age- and gender-matched reference values (P < .01). Correlation between elbow flexion and self-reported QoL was detected. Broader correlations were found for the parents' report. Muscle weakness and decreased QoL in children and adolescents seem to persist already at the beginning of anticancer treatment. This underlines the need of counteracting measures, such as exercise intervention programs, starting as early as possible during the treatment process. Efforts on this topic are currently being carried out by our group.","['Deisenroth, Anne', 'Sontgerath, Regine', 'Schuster, Anne Judith', 'von Busch, Christine', 'Huber, Gerhard', 'Eckert, Katharina', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Wiskemann, Joachim']","['Deisenroth A', 'Sontgerath R', 'Schuster AJ', 'von Busch C', 'Huber G', 'Eckert K', 'Kulozik AE', 'Wiskemann J']","['a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Hemostaseology , Leipzig University Hospital , Leipzig , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology , Heidelberg , Germany.', ""c Centre for Paediatric Medicine, Women's Clinic, Klinikum Stuttgart , Stuttgart , Germany."", 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd Institute of Sports and Sport Science, Ruprecht Karls University , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'e Institute of Exercise and Public Health, Faculty of Sport Science, Leipzig University , Leipzig , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'f Department of Medical Oncology , National Center for Tumor Diseases and Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20161003,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Muscle Strength', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2016/11/01 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2016.1219796 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep;33(6):393-407. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2016.1219796.

We have previously shown that inactivation of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic cells results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Here we show that 12% of Dnmt3a-deficient mice develop CD8+ mature peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) and 29% of mice are affected by both diseases. 10% of Dnmt3a+/- mice develop lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in PTCL. DNA methylation was deregulated genome-wide with 10-fold more hypo- than hypermethylated promoters and enhancers, demonstrating that hypomethylation is a major event in the development of PTCL. Hypomethylated promoters were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors AML1, NF-kappaB and OCT1, implying the transcription factors potential involvement in Dnmt3a-associated methylation. Whereas 71 hypomethylated genes showed an increased expression in PTCL, only 3 hypermethylated genes were silenced, suggesting that cancer-specific hypomethylation has broader effects on the transcriptome of cancer cells than hypermethylation. Interestingly, transcriptomes of Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aDelta/Delta lymphomas were largely conserved and significantly overlapped with those of human tumors. Importantly, we observed downregulation of tumor suppressor p53 in Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aDelta/Delta lymphomas as well as in pre-tumor thymocytes from 9 months old but not 6 weeks old Dnmt3a+/- tumor-free mice, suggesting that p53 downregulation is chronologically an intermediate event in tumorigenesis. Decrease in p53 is likely an important event in tumorigenesis because its overexpression inhibited proliferation in mouse PTCL cell lines, suggesting that low levels of p53 are important for tumor maintenance. Altogether, our data link the haploinsufficient tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a in the prevention of mouse mature CD8+ PTCL indirectly to a bona fide tumor suppressor of T cell malignancies p53.","['Haney, Staci L', 'Upchurch, G Michael', 'Opavska, Jana', 'Klinkebiel, David', 'Hlady, Ryan A', 'Roy, Sohini', 'Dutta, Samikshan', 'Datta, Kaustubh', 'Opavsky, Rene']","['Haney SL', 'Upchurch GM', 'Opavska J', 'Klinkebiel D', 'Hlady RA', 'Roy S', 'Dutta S', 'Datta K', 'Opavsky R']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,,,PMC5045215,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1006334 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-16-00611 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2016 Sep 30;12(9):e1006334. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006334. eCollection 2016 Sep.,"['P30 GM106397/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA188561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4193-0733', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2829-4237']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-treatment recurrence is high, especially among elderly patients, thus necessitating more effective treatment modalities. Development of novel anti-leukemic compounds relies heavily on traditional in vitro screens which require extensive resources and time. Therefore, integration of in silico screens prior to experimental validation can improve the efficiency of pre-clinical drug development. Areas covered: This article reviews different methods and frameworks used to computationally screen for anti-leukemic agents. In particular, three approaches are discussed including molecular docking, transcriptomic integration, and network analysis. Expert opinion: Today's data deluge presents novel opportunities to develop computational tools and pipelines to screen for likely therapeutic candidates in the treatment of leukemia. Formal integration of these methodologies can accelerate and improve the efficiency of modern day anti-leukemic drug discovery and ease the economic and healthcare burden associated with it.","['Ung, Matthew H', 'Varn, Frederick S', 'Cheng, Chao']","['Ung MH', 'Varn FS', 'Cheng C']","['a Department of Molecular and Systems Biology , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Hanover , NH , USA.', 'a Department of Molecular and Systems Biology , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Hanover , NH , USA.', 'a Department of Molecular and Systems Biology , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Hanover , NH , USA.', 'b Department of Biomedical Data Science , Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon , NH , USA.', 'c Norris Cotton Cancer Center , Lebanon , NH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161011,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Discovery/methods', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation']",PMC5180445,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1243524 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Dec;11(12):1213-1222. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1243524.

Long-lived humoral immunity as well as most B-cell malignancies, originate in the germinal center (GC). Murine GC B-cells depend on pro-survival protein MCL-1, but not BCL-XL. In contrast, naive and memory B-cells depend on BCL-2, but not BCL-XL or MCL-1. For human B-cell subsets, the functional relationships among BCL-2 members are unclear, and also if and how they shift after malignant transformation. We here dissect these aspects in human tonsil and primary leukemia (CLL) cells by single and combined treatment with novel, highly specific BH3-mimetics. We found that MCL-1 expression in GC B-cells is regulated post-translationally and its importance is highlighted by preferential binding to pro-apoptotic BIM. In contrast, BCL-XL is transcriptionally induced and binds solely to weak sensitizer BIK, potentially explaining why BCL-XL is not required for GC B-cell survival. Using novel BH3-mimetics, we found that naive and memory B-cells depend on BCL-2, GC cells predominantly on MCL-1, whereas plasma cells need both BCL-XL and MCL-1 for survival. CLL cells switch from highly sensitive for BCL-2 inhibition to resistant after CD40-stimulation. However, combined inhibition of BCL-2, plus BCL-XL or MCL-1 effectively kills these cells, thus exposing a weakness that may be therapeutically useful. These general principles offer important clues for designing treatment strategies for B-cell malignancies.","['Peperzak, Victor', 'Slinger, Erik', 'Ter Burg, Johanna', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Peperzak V', 'Slinger E', 'Ter Burg J', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Germinal Center/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5260491,,2016/10/01 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2016105 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Jan;24(1):111-119. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.105.

Given the important role of fatty acids in megakaryocytes, we have studied the role of this gene in the development of this lineage. Here we show that the expression of FAXDC2 is constantly elevated during megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, FAXDC2 is significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, FAXDC2 overexpression promotes the differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells, whereas its knockdown disrupts their maturation. Mechanism study shows that FAXDC2 overexpression enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increases RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) expression. FAXDC2 also restores megakaryocytic differentiation in cells exposed to an ERK inhibitor or those expressing a dominant negative form of RUNX1. Finally, FAXDC2 overexpression leads to an increase in sphingolipid GM3 synthase, suggesting a potential role of FAXDC2 in lipid metabolism that increases ERK signaling and facilitates megakaryocyte differentiation. Together, these results show that FAXDC2 plays a novel role in development of megakaryocytes and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal hematopoietic cell development in leukemia.","['Jin, Q', 'Ren, Y', 'Wang, M', 'Suraneni, P K', 'Li, D', 'Crispino, J D', 'Fan, J', 'Huang, Z']","['Jin Q', 'Ren Y', 'Wang M', 'Suraneni PK', 'Li D', 'Crispino JD', 'Fan J', 'Huang Z']","[""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', ""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,PMC5056977,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201687 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.87 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Sep 30;6(9):e478. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the promoter region and the entire transcript are embedded in a CpG island, we postulated that BM742401 is a tumor suppressor lncRNA inactivated by DNA methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The promoter of BM742401 was unmethylated in normal controls including three each of normal bone marrow, peripheral blood buffy coats, and CD19-sorted peripheral B-cells, but methylated in four (57.1%) CLL cell lines. Methylation of BM742401 correlated inversely with expression. In the completely methylated WAC3CD5+ CLL cells, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment led to promoter demethylation and re-expression of BM742401 transcript. Functionally, stable overexpression of BM742401 resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation and enhanced apoptosis through caspase-9-dependent intrinsic but not caspase-8-dependent extrinsic apoptosis pathway, suggesting a tumor suppressor role of BM742401 in CLL. In primary CLL samples, methylation of BM742401 was detected in 43/98 (43.9%) of patients. Moreover, among CLL patients with standard-risk cytogenetic aberrations, methylation of BM742401 correlated with advanced Rai stage (>/= stage 2)(P = 0.002). Furthermore, BM742401 methylation was associated with miR-129-2 methylation (P = 0.05). BM742401 is a tumor suppressor lncRNA frequently methylated in CLL. The mechanism of BM742401 as a tumor suppressor warrants further studies.","['Wang, Lu Qian', 'Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'Li, Zhen Hai', 'Chim, Chor Sang']","['Wang LQ', 'Wong KY', 'Li ZH', 'Chim CS']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC5347700,,2016/10/01 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['12252 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12252 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 13;7(50):82400-82410. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12252.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn129 microRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BM742401', 'DNA methylation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'lncRNA', 'tumor suppressor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAR- and mAbs-based immunotherapies have been successfully applied targeting other antigens, however, occurrence of refractory disease to these interventions urges the identification of additional strategies. Here, we identified a TCR recognizing the CD22-derived peptide RPFPPHIQL (CD22RPF) presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*07:02. To overcome tolerance to self-antigens such as CD22, we exploited the immunogenicity of allogeneic HLA. CD22RPF-specific T-cell clone 9D4 was isolated from a healthy HLA-B*07:02neg individual, efficiently produced cytokines upon stimulation with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia and healthy B-cells, but did not react towards healthy hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell subsets, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages expressing low levels of CD22. Gene transfer of TCR-9D4 installed potent CD22-specificity onto recipient CD8+ T-cells that recognized and lysed primary B-cell leukemia. TCR-transduced T-cells spared healthy CD22neg hematopoietic cell subsets but weakly lysed CD22low-expressing DCs and macrophages. CD22-specific TCR-engineered T-cells could form an additional immunotherapeutic strategy with a complementary role to CAR- and antibody-based interventions in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. However, CD22 expression on non-B-cells may limit the attractiveness of CD22 as target-antigen in cellular immunotherapy.","['Jahn, Lorenz', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'van der Steen, Dirk M', 'Hombrink, Pleun', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Schoonakker, Marjolein P', 'de Ridder, Danielle', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['Jahn L', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'van der Steen DM', 'Hombrink P', 'Kester MG', 'Schoonakker MP', 'de Ridder D', 'van Veelen PA', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, 1006 AD Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology']",PMC5342099,,2016/10/01 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['12247 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12247 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 1;7(44):71536-71547. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12247.,,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD22', 'TCR gene transfer', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic HLA', 'immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their underlying molecular mechanism of action involves the activation of apoptosis and autophagy but remains widely unclear. Here we present evidence that autophagy induction by thiopurines is a survival mechanism that antagonizes apoptosis and is involved in degrading damaged mitochondria through mitophagy. On the other hand, apoptosis is the main cell death mechanism by thiopurines as its inhibition prohibited cell death. Thus a tight interplay between apoptosis and autophagy controls cell fate in response to thiopurine treatment. Moreover, thiopurines disrupt mitochondrial function and induce a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in thiopurine-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibiting oxidative stress protected the cells from thiopurine-induced cell death and ROS scavenging prohibited autophagy induction by thiopurines. Our data indicate that the anticarcinogenic effects of thiopurines are mediated by complex interplay between cellular mechanisms governing redox homeostasis, apoptosis and autophagy.","['Chaabane, Wiem', 'Appell, Malin Lindqvist']","['Chaabane W', 'Appell ML']","['Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Azathioprine/pharmacology', 'Base Pair Mismatch/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitophagy/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",PMC5342765,,2016/10/01 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['12313 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12313 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 15;7(46):75616-75634. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12313.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', '6-thioguanine', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'azathioprine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated if a modulation of the diet could impact on Mcl-1 expression using a Myc-driven lymphoma model. We established that a partial reduction of caloric intake by 25% represents an efficient way to decrease Mcl-1 expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, using isocaloric custom diets, we observed that carbohydrates (CHO) are the main regulators of Mcl-1 expression within the food. Indeed, feeding lymphoma-bearing mice with a diet having 25% less carbohydrates was sufficient to decrease Mcl-1 expression by 50% in lymphoma cells. We showed that a low CHO diet resulted in AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition leading to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) inhibition, blocking protein translation elongation. Strikingly, a low CHO diet was sufficient to sensitize Myc-driven lymphoma-bearing mice to ABT-737-induced cell death in vivo. Thus reducing carbohydrate intake may represent a safe way to decrease Mcl-1 expression and to sensitize tumor cells to anti-cancer therapeutics.","['Rubio-Patino, Camila', 'Bossowski, Jozef P', 'Villa, Elodie', 'Mondragon, Laura', 'Zunino, Barbara', 'Proics, Emma', 'Chiche, Johanna', 'Bost, Frederic', 'Verhoeyen, Els', 'Ricci, Jean-Ehrland']","['Rubio-Patino C', 'Bossowski JP', 'Villa E', 'Mondragon L', 'Zunino B', 'Proics E', 'Chiche J', 'Bost F', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Ricci JE']","['Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", ""Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, Departement d'Anesthesie Reanimation, Nice, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Cellular and Molecular Physiopathology of Obesity and Diabetes"", Nice, France.', 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", 'Inserm, U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Equipe ""Controle Metabolique des Morts Cellulaires"", Nice, France.', ""Universite Nice Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Biological Mimicry', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",PMC5341978,,2016/10/01 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['12309 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12309 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):73270-73279. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12309.,,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'cancer', 'low carbohydrate diet', 'metabolism', 'resistance to treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dental pulp is known to have a potential to differentiate into neural-like cells; therefore, dental pulp may be used as an autologous cell source for neural repair. In this study, we selectively expanded stem cells from human dental pulp in an initial culture using NSC media under xeno- and serum-free conditions. At the initial step of primary culture, human dental pulp was divided into two groups according to the culture media: 10% fetal bovine serum medium group (FBS group) and NSC culture medium group (NSC group). In the NSC group relative to the FBS group, the expression of NSC markers and the concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor, nerve growth factor, and stem cell factor were higher, although their expression levels were lower than those of human fetal NSCs. The transplanted cells of the NSC group survived well within the normal brain and injured spinal cord of rats and expressed nestin and Sox2. Under the xeno- and serum-free conditions, autologous human dental pulp-derived stem cells might prove useful for clinical cell-based therapies to repair damaged neural tissues.","['Jung, Jieun', 'Kim, Jong-Wan', 'Moon, Ho-Jin', 'Hong, Jin Young', 'Hyun, Jung Keun']","['Jung J', 'Kim JW', 'Moon HJ', 'Hong JY', 'Hyun JK']","['Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea; Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea; Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Restorative Dentistry & Endodontics, College of Dentistry, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea; Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160905,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,PMC5027310,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:01,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/6921097 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2016;2016:6921097. doi: 10.1155/2016/6921097.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The examined group consisted of 21 consecutive patients, aged 1-18 years, diagnosed with B-cell ALL in 2010, and 10 relapsed B-cell ALL patients diagnosed for the first time between 2009 and 2011, who developed relapse before 2014. All subjects were treated in the Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology of the Medical University of Warsaw according to the ALL-IC BFM 2002 Protocol. We evaluated mTOR and phospho-mTOR expression by immunohistochemistry using rabbit monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: mTOR expression was found to be significantly associated with the risk of relapse and was more frequent in ALL recurrence. No significant relationship was detected between mTOR expression and other features of high-risk disease in paediatric ALL. CONCLUSIONS: mTOR activity could be considered a high-risk feature in paediatric B-cell ALL. Expression of mTOR kinase is observed remarkably more frequently in disease recurrence than at first diagnosis, indicating higher proliferative and survival potential of leukaemic cells in relapse. Routine analysis of mTOR activity could be performed to select patients that may potentially benefit from mTOR inhibitors (MTI) treatment.","['Ulinska, Edyta', 'Mycko, Katarzyna', 'Salacinska-Los, Elzbieta', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Siwicka, Alicja', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Matysiak, Michal']","['Ulinska E', 'Mycko K', 'Salacinska-Los E', 'Pastorczak A', 'Siwicka A', 'Mlynarski W', 'Matysiak M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, and Oncology, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Haematology, and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Pathomorphology, the Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Haematology, and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, and Oncology, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Haematology, and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, and Oncology, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160905,Poland,Contemp Oncol (Pozn),"Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)",101233223,,,PMC5032156,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:01,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2015/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/wo.2016.61848 [doi]', '28188 [pii]']",ppublish,Contemp Oncol (Pozn). 2016;20(4):291-6. doi: 10.5114/wo.2016.61848.

It is important for new HPSCT program to look at its patient outcome data and compare it with the published data to evaluate the efficacy of program. AIMS: The aim was to compile and collate the patient outcome data of HPSCT and compare with published reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient demographics, indications, stem cell harvest by apheresis, dose collected, infusion, engraftment, and follow-up data were collected from hospital information system from 2010 to 2013 in a tertiary care hospital. HPSCs were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and harvests were done on the 5(th) day. Engraftment was decided for neutrophil when counts were 0.5 x 10(9)/L and for platelets when counts were 20 x 10(9)/L on two consecutive days without any transfusion support. RESULTS: There were 133 harvests for 95 patients with various disorders; multiple myeloma was most common in autologous and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in allogeneic group. One hundred harvests were done for autologous and 33 for allogeneic HPSCT. In autologous group, of 66 patients, 60 (90.9%) received stem cell infusion at median dose of 4.63 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Similarly, in allogeneic group, of 29 patients, 27 (93.10%) received infusion at median dose of 5.8 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. 58 (96.9%) patients and 25 (92.6%) engrafted in autologous and allogeneic group, respectively. The median time for neutrophils engraftment was 11 days in autologous group and 12 days in allogeneic group. The median time for platelet engraftment was 11.5 days in autologous group and 13 days in allogeneic group. The 100-day survival rate was 95% (n = 57) in autologous group and 77.8% (n = 21) in allogeneic group.

Its role in childhood malignancies needs to be discussed as paediatric malignancies differ from adults in tumor subtypes and they have different tumor biology and FDG uptake patterns. This is also compounded by smaller body mass, dosimetric restrictions, and physiological factors that can affect the FDG uptake. It calls for careful planning of the PET study, preparing the child, the parents, and expertise of nuclear physicians in reporting pediatric positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) studies. In a broad perspective, FDG-PET/CT has been used in staging, assessment of therapy response, identifying metastases and as a follow-up tool in a wide variety of pediatric malignancies.

RESULTS: Difference between groups was statistically significant for age, number of teeth and frequency of dental checkups (p<0.05). Patients with CLL had significantly higher average values of periodontal indices (API 0.81+/-0.18; PBI 2.72+/-0.68; PPD 3.40+/-0.53; REC 1.95+/-0.87, CAL 4.37+/-0.80) compared to the control group (API 0.69+/-0.15; PBI 1.91+/-0.45; PPD 2.51+/-0.40; REC 0.99+/-0.54; CAL 3.00+/-0.58). The correlation coefficients between age and periodontal indices showed statistically significance between age and REC (r=0.357; p<0.01), and age and CAL (r=0.295; p<0.05). Age was not statistically significant covariate for CAL (F=2.205; p>0.05), only for REC (F=4.601; p<0.05). After the removal of the statistical effect of age, the difference in REC between CLL and control group remained statistically significant (F=19.732; p<0.01; eta(2)=0.287). Statistically significant association between periodontal and hematological parameters in CLL patients was not found (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that patients with CLL had worse periodontal status compared to healthy subjects. Causal relationship between periodontal and hematological parameters was not proved.","['Rincic, Nives', 'Bozic, Darko', 'Rincic, Goran', 'Gacina, Petar', 'Plancak, Darije']","['Rincic N', 'Bozic D', 'Rincic G', 'Gacina P', 'Plancak D']","['Department of Dental and Oral Pathology with Periodontology, Dental Policlinic Zagreb, Perkovceva 3, 10000 Zagreb.', 'Department of Periodontology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb, Gunduliceva 5, 10000 Zagreb.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre ""Sisters of Mercy"", Vinogradska 29, 10000 Zagreb.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre ""Sisters of Mercy"", Vinogradska 29, 10000 Zagreb.', 'Department of Periodontology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb, Gunduliceva 5, 10000 Zagreb.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Acta Stomatol Croat,Acta stomatologica Croatica,0253456,,,PMC5017273,['The authors deny any conflicts of interest.'],2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:01,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15644/asc50/1/4 [doi]', 'ASC_50(1)_23-33 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Stomatol Croat. 2016 Mar;50(1):23-33. doi: 10.15644/asc50/1/4.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DMF Index', 'Gingivitis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Periodontal Index', 'Periodontitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All platinum(II) glycoconjugates were characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, HRMS as well as (195)Pt-NMR analysis. Despite their substantial improvement in water solubility, the conjugates exhibited comparable or better in vitro cytotoxicities than oxaliplatin determined in six different human cancer cell lines. Glu-Me-Pt has been shown to be more effective than cisplatin and oxaliplatin with improved therapeutic index in leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice model. The potential GLUT transportability of the complexes was investigated using cell-based fluorescent competition assay and GLUT inhibitor mediated cell viability analysis in GLUT over-expressing HT29 cell line. Each sugar motif was found to be useful to enable the platinum(II) complexes as substrate for GLUT mediated cell uptake. In vitro DNA adduct formation analysis has been investigated for the first time for this class of compounds to reveal the intrinsic differences in antitumor activity between the malonatoplatinum(II) glycoconjugates and oxaliplatin. The intrinsic DNA reactivity of the platinum(II)-sugar conjugates was found as Gal-Me-Pt > Glu-Me-Pt > Man-Me-Pt approximately oxaliplatin by kinetic study on the formation of platinum(II) adducts with guanosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP). The results from this study demonstrate the usefulness of glucose, mannose and galactose as alternative sugar motif on glycoconjugation for GLUT mediated drug design and pharmaceutical R&D, and the obtained fundamental results also support the potential of the GLUT targeted platinum(II)-sugar conjugates as lead compounds for further pre-clinical evaluation.","['Gao, Xiangqian', 'Liu, Shengnan', 'Shi, Yunli', 'Huang, Zhenhua', 'Mi, Yi', 'Mi, Qian', 'Yang, Jinna', 'Gao, Qingzhi']","['Gao X', 'Liu S', 'Shi Y', 'Huang Z', 'Mi Y', 'Mi Q', 'Yang J', 'Gao Q']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.', 'School of Life Science, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.', 'Central Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, CSPC Pharmaceutical Group, 226 Huanghe Road, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050035, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Gudui BioPharma Technology Inc., 5 Lanyuan Road, Huayuan Industrial Park, Tianjin 300384, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 92 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, PR China.

Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has realized the contribution of pharmacogenomics in better healthcare and advocated the consideration of pharmacogenomic principles in making safer and more effective drug. Many anticancer drugs show reduced or no response in cancer patients with tumor specific gene mutations such as B-Raf and K-Ras. The high incidence of K-Ras mutation has been reported in pancreatic, colon, and lung carcinomas. The identification of K-Ras as a clinical biomarker and potential therapeutic target has attracted the scientific community to develop effective and precise anticancer drug. Inhibitors which block farnesylation of Ras have been developed or under clinical trial studies. Tipifarnib, approved by USFDA for the treatment of elderly acute leukemia is a Ras pathway inhibitor. Some peptidomimetics and bi-substrate inhibitors like FTI 276, FTI 277, B956, B1086, L731, L735, L739, L750, BMS-214662, L778123, and L778123 are under clinical trials. Recently mutant K-Ras has been considered as potential biomarker and target for precise cancer therapy. This review focuses primarily on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway including K-Ras mutation as therapeutic target, inhibitors and their structure activity relationships (SARs) for the design and development of anticancer agents.","['Asati, Vivek', 'Mahapatra, Debarshi Kar', 'Bharti, Sanjay Kumar']","['Asati V', 'Mahapatra DK', 'Bharti SK']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya (A Central University), Bilaspur 495009, Chhattisgarh, India.

During a prolonged disease course, a secondary B-cell neoplasm may arise in some patients, the most common example being the clonal evolution of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is referred to as Richter transformation. Secondary de novo mature B-cell neoplasms arising in a patient with pre-existing CLL have been described; however, B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) developing in untreated CLL is rare, and its clonal relationship to the primary neoplasm has been an interesting issue. Herein, we report an unusual case of the sequential development of CLL and B-ALL over a 23-year period in a 64-year-old male. Examination of the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated dual neoplastic populations: small mature lymphocytes consistent with those seen in CLL and a population of blasts that were confirmed to be B-ALL by immunophenotyping. The biclonality of these two B-cell neoplasms was supported by cytogenetic studies. While an intrinsic immunodeficiency in patients with CLL may predispose them to the development of other malignancies, the pathogenesis of this unusual phenomenon remains to be further investigated.","['Wu, Bin', 'Ingersoll, Kimberly', 'Rehder, Catherine', 'Wang, Endi']","['Wu B', 'Ingersoll K', 'Rehder C', 'Wang E']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Shengjing Hospital Affiliated with China Medical University, Shenyang, People's Republic of China; Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States."", 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.

The linker is biodegradable in the presence of Glutathione (GSH, an endogenous component in cells), which leads to release of CPT.

Thus, there is an urgent need for anti-metastasis therapy. Surprisingly, emerging evidence suggests that certain anti-cancer drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin can actually promote metastasis, but the mechanism(s) behind their pro-metastatic effects are still unclear. Here, we use a microfluidic microcirculation mimetic (MMM) platform which mimics the capillary constrictions of the pulmonary and peripheral microcirculation, to determine if in-vivo-like mechanical stimuli can evoke different responses from cells subjected to various cancer drugs. In particular, we show that leukemic cancer cells treated with doxorubicin and daunorubicin, commonly used anti-cancer drugs, have over 100% longer transit times through the device, compared to untreated leukemic cells. Such delays in the microcirculation are known to promote extravasation of cells, a key step in the metastatic cascade. Furthermore, we report a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the chemotactic migration of the doxorubicin treated leukemic cells. Both enhanced retention in the microcirculation and enhanced migration following chemotherapy, are pro-metastatic effects which can serve as new targets for anti-metastatic drugs.","['Prathivadhi-Bhayankaram, Sruti V', 'Ning, Jianhao', 'Mimlitz, Michael', 'Taylor, Carolyn', 'Gross, Erin', 'Nichols, Michael', 'Guck, Jochen', 'Ekpenyong, Andrew E']","['Prathivadhi-Bhayankaram SV', 'Ning J', 'Mimlitz M', 'Taylor C', 'Gross E', 'Nichols M', 'Guck J', 'Ekpenyong AE']","['Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307, Germany.', 'Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.

SMNs comprised 10 leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, 5 lymphomas induced by Epstein-Barr virus after allograft, and 49 solid tumors, including mainly 25 carcinomas (17 of the thyroid), 9 bone sarcomas, and 7 central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The median latency occurrence was 6.5 years, and that of thyroid carcinomas induced by 12 Gy fractioned total body irradiation (TBI) was 7.6 years. The relative risk (RR) of an SMN was increased by genetic and family factors and increased 17 to 69 times according to the dose of radiotherapy administered in the region for the first cancer. Age younger than 4 years at the time of radiotherapy increased the risk of SMN. Chemotherapy adjusted according to the dose of radiotherapy administered in the field yielded a greater RR of an SMN only for cumulative doses exceeding 2 g/m(2) of epipodophyllotoxin but not for alkylating agents or platinum compounds. The RR of secondary leukemia increased 10-fold following high doses of epipodophyllotoxin >2 g/m(2) but was not affected by alkylating agents or anthracyclines. The crude RR of a solid SMN developing after radiotherapy was very high at 18 and reached 90.7 for thyroid carcinoma after TBI, whereas the authors observed no increased risk associated with chemotherapy. These results confirm the risk of secondary leukemia after epipodophyllotoxin and of solid tumor after radiotherapy.","['Casagranda, L', 'Oriol, M', 'Freycon, F', 'Frappaz, D', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Bergeron, C', 'Plantaz, D', 'Stephan, J L', 'Freycon, C', 'Gomez, F', 'Berger, C', 'Trombert-Paviot, B']","['Casagranda L', 'Oriol M', 'Freycon F', 'Frappaz D', 'Bertrand Y', 'Bergeron C', 'Plantaz D', 'Stephan JL', 'Freycon C', 'Gomez F', 'Berger C', 'Trombert-Paviot B']","['a Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'b Laboratory EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health) , Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne , COMUE (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'c Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'd Department of Public Health and Medical Informatics , University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'c Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'e Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Lyon , France.', 'e Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Lyon , France.', 'e Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Lyon , France.', 'f Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Grenoble , Grenoble , France.', 'a Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'f Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Grenoble , Grenoble , France.', 'g Centre Leon Berard , Lyon , France.', 'a Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'b Laboratory EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health) , Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne , COMUE (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'c Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'b Laboratory EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health) , Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne , COMUE (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'c Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, University of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.', 'd Department of Public Health and Medical Informatics , University Hospital of Saint-Etienne , Saint-Etienne , France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160929,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/*administration & dosage', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,2016/11/01 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2016.1214653 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep;33(6):371-382. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2016.1214653.

This study aimed to describe how couples whose child has received a transplant for the treatment of leukaemia view conjugal resilience and to evaluate the role of we-ness as a precursor of conjugal adjustment. METHODS: Four parental couples were interviewed. Interviews were analysed in two ways: inductive thematic analysis and rating of verbal content with the We-ness Coding Scale. RESULTS: Participants report that conjugal resilience involves the identification of the couple as a team and cohesion in the couple. Being a team generates certain collaborative interactions that lead to conjugal resilience. A sense of we-ness in parents is associated with fluctuation in the frequency of themes. DISCUSSION: Participants' vision of conjugal resilience introduced novel themes. The sense of we-ness facilitates cohesion and the process of conjugal resilience.,"['Martin, Julie', 'Peloquin, Katherine', 'Vachon, Marie-France', 'Duval, Michel', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Martin J', 'Peloquin K', 'Vachon MF', 'Duval M', 'Sultan S']","['Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada; julie.martin.6@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Universite de Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160928,United States,Int J Qual Stud Health Well-being,International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,101256506,,,PMC5043079,"['Conflict of interests and funding The authors declare that there are no links or', 'conflicts of interest.

Because specific blockade of druggable RAS effectors might represent an alternative treatment approach, we evaluated the role of the Raf complex for multiple myeloma (MM) pathobiology. We found frequent overexpression of the Raf isoforms (A-, B- and C-Raf) and downstream activation of MEK1,2/ERK1,2 in MM cells. Concomitant inhibition of all Raf isoforms (pan-Raf inhibition) by RNAi or pharmacological inhibitors was required to strongly induce apoptosis in human MM cell lines (HMCLs), in primary MM cells in vitro, and in a syngeneic MM mouse model in vivo. The anti-MM effect of pan-Raf inhibition did not correlate with the RAS mutation status, and functionally appeared to involve both MEK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that pan-Raf activity affects PI3K-dependent signalling, thus highlighting a functional link between the RAS/Raf and PI3K/mTOR/Akt pro-survival pathways. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K strongly enhanced the anti-MM effect of pan-Raf inhibition in MM cell lines and in primary MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Concomitant pan-Raf/PI3K inhibition was also effective in carfilzomib- and lenalidomide-resistant MM models underscoring that this attractive therapeutic anti-MM strategy is suitable for immediate clinical translation.","['Muller, E', 'Bauer, S', 'Stuhmer, T', 'Mottok, A', 'Scholz, C-J', 'Steinbrunn, T', 'Brunnert, D', 'Brandl, A', 'Schraud, H', 'Kressmann, S', 'Beilhack, A', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Bargou, R C', 'Chatterjee, M']","['Muller E', 'Bauer S', 'Stuhmer T', 'Mottok A', 'Scholz CJ', 'Steinbrunn T', 'Brunnert D', 'Brandl A', 'Schraud H', 'Kressmann S', 'Beilhack A', 'Rosenwald A', 'Bargou RC', 'Chatterjee M']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Core Unit Systems Medicine, Interdisciplinary Clinical Research Center, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCCMF), University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Translational Oncology, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Lenalidomide', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016264 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.264 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Apr;31(4):922-933. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.264.

Consequently, current risk stratification at diagnosis not only relies on cytogenetics, but also on the inclusion of several of these abnormalities. Despite this progress, AML remains a heterogeneous and complex malignancy with variable response to current therapy. Although copy-number alterations (CNAs) are accepted prognostic markers in cancers, large-scale genomic studies aiming at identifying specific prognostic CNA-based markers in AML are still lacking. Using 367 AML, we identified four recurrent CNA on chromosomes 11 and 21 that predicted outcome even after adjusting for standard prognostic risk factors and potentially delineated two new subclasses of AML with poor prognosis. ERG amplification, the most frequent CNA, was related to cytarabine resistance, a cornerstone drug of AML therapy. These findings were further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Our results demonstrate that specific CNA are of independent prognostic relevance, and provide new molecular information into the genomic basis of AML and cytarabine response. Finally, these CNA identified two potential novel risk groups of AML, which when confirmed prospectively, may improve the clinical risk stratification and potentially the AML outcome.","['Nibourel, O', 'Guihard, S', 'Roumier, C', 'Pottier, N', 'Terre, C', 'Paquet, A', 'Peyrouze, P', 'Geffroy, S', 'Quentin, S', 'Alberdi, A', 'Abdelali, R B', 'Renneville, A', 'Demay, C', 'Celli-Lebras, K', 'Barbry, P', 'Quesnel, B', 'Castaigne, S', 'Dombret, H', 'Soulier, J', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Cheok, M H']","['Nibourel O', 'Guihard S', 'Roumier C', 'Pottier N', 'Terre C', 'Paquet A', 'Peyrouze P', 'Geffroy S', 'Quentin S', 'Alberdi A', 'Abdelali RB', 'Renneville A', 'Demay C', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Barbry P', 'Quesnel B', 'Castaigne S', 'Dombret H', 'Soulier J', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cheok MH']","['CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1172, Institute for Cancer Research of Lille, Factors of Leukemia Cell Persistance, Lille Cedex, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Lille, France.', 'Hospital of Versailles, Department of Hematology, Chesnay, France.', ""University Cote d'Azur, CNRS Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Sophia-Antipolis, Nice, France."", 'INSERM UMR-S1172, Institute for Cancer Research of Lille, Factors of Leukemia Cell Persistance, Lille Cedex, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'University Paris Diderot, INSERM U944 Saint-Louis Hospital, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Diderot, INSERM U944 Saint-Louis Hospital, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Diderot, INSERM U944 Saint-Louis Hospital, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'University Paris 7, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', ""University Cote d'Azur, CNRS Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Sophia-Antipolis, Nice, France."", 'INSERM UMR-S1172, Institute for Cancer Research of Lille, Factors of Leukemia Cell Persistance, Lille Cedex, France.', 'Hospital of Versailles, Department of Hematology, Chesnay, France.', 'University Paris 7, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Diderot, INSERM U944 Saint-Louis Hospital, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'CHU Lille University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S1172, Institute for Cancer Research of Lille, Factors of Leukemia Cell Persistance, Lille Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016265 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.265 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):555-564. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.265.

Methods: A case-controlled study was conducted in Shenzhen Children's Hospital, China from January 2015 to January 2016. The cases were selected from the section of Hematology and Oncology, and the controls were selected from Orthopedics by 1ratio2 matching of cases according to sex and age. A questionnaire including population data and chemical exposure characteristics was conducted on the children's parents, and urine and EDTA-blood were collected from the children. Then, we quantitatively measured the internal dose of formaldehyde(i.e., formaldehyde-human serum albumin)by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the doses of metabolites benzene, toluene, and xylene(i.e., trans-muconic acid, hippuric acid, and methylhippuric acid)by high-performance liquid chromatography. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationships between exposure factors measured from children and their parents and cALL. Results: In the study, 71 cases(average age: 6.08+/-3.61 years), and 142 controls(average age: 5.91+/-3.57 years)were assessed; there were no differences in general demographics between two groups. The self-reported results showed that living in a home that had been painted in the past 10 years(OR=4.39, 95% CI: 1.87-10.31), maternal chemical exposure during pregnancy(OR=11.78, 95% CI: 1.65-83.88), paternal diesel or gasoline exposure(OR=8.15, 95% CI: 2.68-24.83), paternal dye exposure(OR=7.77, 95% CI: 1.52-39.67)and trash burning near the child's residence(OR=6.08, 95% CI: 1.17-31.66)were associated with increased risk of cALL. The positive detection rates of only benzene metabolites were significantly higher in cases(40/44)than controls(81/111)(chi(2)=5.92, P=0.021). The median formaldehyde and benzene concentrations in cases(32.120 pg/ml, 2.505 mug/gCr)were significantly higher than those in controls(18.705 pg/ml, 0.672 mug/gCr; Z values:-1.98 and-3.95, P values: 0.047 and<0.001, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that benzene exposure(OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.00-1.19), home painting in the past 10 years(OR=3.56, 95% CI: 1.20-10.53)and paternal diesel or gasoline exposure(OR= 3.75, 95% CI: 1.06-13.22)were associated with increased risk of cALL. Conclusion: A variety of environmental chemistry factors, such as benzene exposure, increase the risk of cALL, and further studies are warranted to explore their specific roles.","['Jiang, W C', 'Wu, S Y', 'Ke, Y B']","['Jiang WC', 'Wu SY', 'Ke YB']","['Key Laboratory of Genetics & Molecular Medicine of Shenzhen, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen 518055, China; #Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 35018, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'China', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Toluene/*adverse effects', 'Xylenes/*adverse effects']",,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2016.10.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Oct 6;50(10):893-899. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2016.10.011.,,"['0 (Xylenes)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed treatment patterns and outcomes among elderly patients newly diagnosed with AML in the US community oncology setting. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using patient-level data from a network of US community oncology practices provided by Altos Solutions. Patients aged >/= 60 years, diagnosed with AML between November 2005 and February 2014, with >/= 1 recorded visit and >/= 6 months between diagnosis and data cutoff, were included. Only patients who received active treatment or best supportive care (BSC) per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) AML Guidelines were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1139 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 922 (median age 76 years) received NCCN-recommended treatments: standard induction (n = 5), low-intensity therapy (n = 425), BSC with hydroxyurea (HU) (n = 36), or BSC without HU (n = 455). For the low-intensity therapy cohort, median time from diagnosis to treatment initiation was 17 days; median duration of therapy was 5.1 months. Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis in the low-intensity, BSC with HU, and BSC without HU groups was 12.3, 7.0, and 49.4 months, respectively. Median time to next therapy/death was 10.1 months in patients receiving low-intensity therapy. A higher proportion of patients receiving low-intensity therapy required transfusion or other supportive care versus those receiving BSC. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, OS in patients receiving low-intensity therapy or BSC with HU is poor for elderly patients with AML. Remarkably, intensive induction strategies are rarely used for older patients in community oncology practice.","['Ma, Esprit', 'Bonthapally, Vijayveer', 'Chawla, Anita', 'Lefebvre, Patrick', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Lafeuille, Marie-Helene', 'Fortier, Jonathan', 'Emond, Bruno', 'Duh, Mei Sheng', 'Dezube, Bruce J']","['Ma E', 'Bonthapally V', 'Chawla A', 'Lefebvre P', 'Swords R', 'Lafeuille MH', 'Fortier J', 'Emond B', 'Duh MS', 'Dezube BJ']","['Medivation, Inc, San Francisco, CA.', 'Sage Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc, Menlo Park, CA.', ""Groupe d'analyse, Ltee, Montreal, QC, Canada.

In the present report, a 47-year-old male had pain in the right foot due to gout. Peripheral blood examination showed leukocytosis with left shift. Bone marrow aspiration revealed myeloid hyperplasia with megakaryocytosis. RT-PCR revealed the major BCR-ABL fusion transcript, and CML in the chronic phase was diagnosed, followed by nilotinib treatment. Although WBC counts decreased immediately, G-banding analysis showed 46,XY,t(8;22)(q24;q11.2),t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) [20]. The t(8;22)(q24;q11.2) translocation is known to be recurrent in Burkitt's lymphoma. The diagnosis was changed to CML in AP, leading to B-lymphoid crisis. Unexpectedly, the karyotype was 46,XY,t(8;22)(q24;q11.2) [20] in hematological complete remission, even after 3 months. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase spreads revealed the MYC signal on the der(22)t(8;22), indicating that the 8q24 breakpoint was centromeric to MYC at 8q24.21. G-banding analysis of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes also indicated 46,XY,t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.2). We conclude that the t(8;22) is constitutional in this patient. As the tumor suppressor gene TRC8/RNF139 is disrupted by constitutional t(8;22)(q24.13;q11.21) in dysgerminoma, it may be associated with the onset of CML.","['Kawamoto, Shinichiro', 'Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Toyoda, Masanori', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi', 'Minami, Hironobu']","['Kawamoto S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Toyoda M', 'Yakushijin K', 'Matsuoka H', 'Minami H']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan. skawamo@med.kobe-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Chuoh-ku Kusunokicho 7-5-2, Kobe City, Hyogo, 650-0017, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160929,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/04/18 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2100-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2100-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Feb;105(2):226-229. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2100-5.

LGL leukemic cells were mostly indistinguishable from normal LGL; however, we developed a simplified approach to distinguishing among these cells, in which lymphocyte % and the proportion of granular lymphocytes among lymphocytes (GL %) can serve as parameters at the cut-off values of 52 and 50 %, respectively. We confirmed the accuracy of these methods in validation groups.

The microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to mediate chemotherapy drug resistance. MiR-451 as a tumor suppressor has been evaluated its potential effect on the sensitivity of cancer cells to DDP. However, the role of miR-451 in regulatory mechanism of chemosensitivity in lung cancer cells is still largely unknown. In this study, we first constructed a cisplatin-resistant A549 cell line (A549/DPP) accompanied with a decreased expression of miR-451 and an increased expression of Mcl-1in the drug resistant cells compared with the parental cells. Exogenous expression of miR-451 level in A549/DPP was found to sensitize their reaction to the treatment of cisplatin, which coincides with reduced expression of Mcl-1. Interestingly, Mcl-1 knockdown in A549/DPP cells increased the chemosensitivity to DPP, suggesting the dependence of Mcl-1 regulation in miR-451 activity. Moreover, miR-451 can restore cisplatin treatment response in cisplatin-resistant xenografts in vivo, while Mcl-1 protein levels were decreased.

In approximately 60% of patients, the Janus kinase 2 gene is mutated, in 20%, the calreticulin gene is mutated, and in 5%, the myeloproliferative leukemia virus gene is mutated. Although patients with mutated calreticulin or myeloproliferative leukemia genes have a favorable outcome, and those with none of these mutations have an unfavorable outcome, prognostication based on mutation status is challenging due to the heterogeneous survival of patients with mutated Janus kinase 2. To develop a prognostic model based on mutation status, we screened primary myelofibrosis patients seen at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA, between 2000 and 2013 for the presence of Janus kinase 2, calreticulin, and myeloproliferative leukemia mutations. Of 344 primary myelofibrosis patients, Janus kinase 2(V617F) was detected in 226 (66%), calreticulin mutation in 43 (12%), and myeloproliferative leukemia mutation in 16 (5%); 59 patients (17%) were triple-negatives. A 50% cut-off dichotomized Janus kinase 2-mutated patients into those with high Janus kinase 2(V617F) allele burden and favorable survival and those with low Janus kinase 2(V617F) allele burden and unfavorable survival. Patients with a favorable mutation status (high Janus kinase 2(V617F) allele burden/myeloproliferative leukemia/calreticulin mutation) and aged 65 years or under had a median survival of 126 months. Patients with one risk factor (low Janus kinase 2(V617F) allele burden/triple-negative or age >65 years) had an intermediate survival duration, and patients aged over 65 years with an adverse mutation status (low Janus kinase 2(V617F) allele burden or triple-negative) had a median survival of only 35 months. Our simple and easily applied age- and mutation status-based scoring system accurately predicted the survival of patients with primary myelofibrosis.","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Dembitz, Vilma', 'Bozinovic, Ksenija', 'Newberry, Kate', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Bove, Joseph E 4th', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Verstovsek S', 'Manshouri T', 'Dembitz V', 'Bozinovic K', 'Newberry K', 'Zhang Y', 'Bove JE 4th', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Davidoff Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Tel Aviv University, Sackler School of Medicine, Israel.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Croatian Institute for Brain Research, Croatia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA zestrov@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160929,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics']",PMC5210235,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.149765 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.149765 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jan;102(1):79-84. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.149765.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether the results changed over time and to identify prognostic factors. Adult patients treated between 1993 and 2012 with myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched sibling (n=2681) or unrelated (n=2178) donors in first complete remission were included. For transplantations from sibling donors performed between 2008 and 2012, 2-year probabilities of overall survival were: 76% (18-25 years old), 69% (26-35 and 36-45 years old) and 60% (46-55 years old). Among recipients of transplantations from unrelated donors, the respective survival rates were 66%, 70%, 61%, and 62%. In comparison with the 1993-2007 period, significant improvements were observed for all age groups except for the 26-35-year old patients. In a multivariate model, transplantations performed between 2008 and 2012, when compared to 1993-2007, were associated with significantly reduced risks of non-relapse mortality (Hazard Ratio 0.77, P=0.00006), relapse (Hazard Ratio 0.85, P=0.007), treatment failure (Hazard Ratio 0.81, P<0.00001), and overall mortality (Hazard Ratio 0.79, P<0.00001). In the analysis restricted to transplantations performed between 2008 and 2012, the use of total body irradiation-based conditioning was associated with reduced risk of relapse (Hazard Ratio 0.48, P=0.004) and treatment failure (Hazard Ratio 0.63, P=0.02). We conclude that results of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia improved significantly over time. Total body irradiation should be considered as the preferable type of myeloablative conditioning.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Browne, Paul', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Wu, Depei', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Giebel S', 'Labopin M', 'Socie G', 'Beelen D', 'Browne P', 'Volin L', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Aljurf M', 'Wu D', 'Michallet M', 'Arnold R', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Poland sgiebel@io.gliwice.pl.', 'Hospital St. Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, France.', 'Hospital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', ""St. James's Hospital - Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.', 'Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'University Lille, Inserm, CHU Lille, U995 - LIRIC - Lille Inflammation Research, International Center, Lille, France.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud - Service Hematologie, Lyon, France.', 'Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin - Campus Virchow Klinikum Berlin, Germany.', 'Hospital St. Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160929,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC5210244,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.145631 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.145631 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jan;102(1):139-149. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.145631.

We examined the role of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 in preclinical models of central nervous system leukemia and performed correlative studies in patients. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells was modulated using short hairpin ribonucleic acid-mediated knockdown or ectopic expression. We show that zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 regulates CCR7/CXCR4 via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. High expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells resulted in a higher proportion of central nervous system leukemia in xenografts as compared to zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 low expressing counterparts. High zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 also enhanced the migration potential towards CCL19/CXCL12 gradients in vitro CCR7 blockade almost abrogated homing of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to the central nervous system in xenografts. In 130 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 117 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 and CCR7/CXCR4 expression levels were significantly correlated. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression correlated with central nervous system disease in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and CCR7/CXCR4 correlated with central nervous system involvement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. In multivariate analysis, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression levels in the upper third and fourth quartiles were associated with central nervous system involvement in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio=7.48, 95% confidence interval, 2.06-27.17; odds ratio=6.86, 95% confidence interval, 1.86-25.26, respectively). CCR7 expression in the upper fourth quartile correlated with central nervous system positivity in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio=11.00, 95% confidence interval, 2.00-60.62).

The advent of gammadelta T cells is largely due to their ability to recognize and target tumor cells using both innate characteristic and T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated mechanisms, their capacity to enhance the generation of antigen-specific T cell responses, and their potential to be used in an autologous or allogeneic setting. METHODS: In this study, we explored the beneficial effect of the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 on purified gammadelta T cells and its use as a stimulatory signal in the ex vivo expansion of gammadelta T cells for adoptive transfer. The expansion protocol was validated both with immune cells of healthy individuals and acute myeloid leukemia patients. RESULTS: We report that the addition of IL-15 to gammadelta T cell cultures results in a more activated phenotype, a higher proliferative capacity, a more pronounced T helper 1 polarization, and an increased cytotoxic capacity of gammadelta T cells. Moreover gammadelta T cell expansion starting with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals and acute myeloid leukemia patients is boosted in the presence of IL-15, whereby the antitumor properties of the gammadelta T cells are strengthened as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the rationale to explore the use of IL-15 in clinical adoptive therapy protocols exploiting gammadelta T cells.","['Van Acker, Heleen H', 'Anguille, Sebastien', 'Willemen, Yannick', 'Van den Bergh, Johan M', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Lion, Eva', 'Smits, Evelien L', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F']","['Van Acker HH', 'Anguille S', 'Willemen Y', 'Van den Bergh JM', 'Berneman ZN', 'Lion E', 'Smits EL', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium. heleen.vanacker@uantwerp.be.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, 2610, Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (TIGR), Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160929,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,,PMC5041439,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0329-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0329-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 29;9(1):101. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0329-3.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adoptive transfer', 'Expansion protocol', 'Gamma delta T cells', 'Interleukin-15', 'Leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different physiological conditions such as cases and controls may manifest as different networks. Statistical comparison between biological networks can provide not only new insight into the disease mechanism but statistical guidance for drug development. However, the methods developed in previous studies are inadequate to capture the changes in both the nodes and edges, and often ignore the network structure. In this study, we present a powerful weighted statistical test for group differences of directed biological networks, which is independent of the network attributes and can capture the changes in both the nodes and edges, as well as simultaneously accounting for the network structure through putting more weights on the difference of nodes locating on relatively more important position. Simulation studies illustrate that this method had better performance than previous ones under various sample sizes and network structures. One application to GWAS of leprosy successfully identifies the specific gene interaction network contributing to leprosy. Another real data analysis significantly identifies a new biological network, which is related to acute myeloid leukemia. One potential network responsible for lung cancer has also been significantly detected.

METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study was conducted at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised data of diagnosed cases of Ewing sarcoma related to the period from February 2013 to December 2014. Clinico-pathological features, including patient age, gender and site of biopsy were studied. Positivity of immunohistochemical markers such as cluster of differentiation 99(membranous staining) and Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor (nuclear staining) were noted. SPSS17 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 50 Ewing sarcoma cases, 26(52%) related to women and 24(48%) to men. The overall mean age was 17+11.53 years (range: 3 to 42 years). Moreover, 30(60%) patients had presented with bone swelling or growth whereas 20(40%) had presented with soft tissue swelling. The site of presentation was upper extremities in 16(32%) patients, lower extremities in 14(28%), maxilla in 7(14%), chest wall in 6(12%), paraspinal region in 4(8%), scalp in 2(4%) and retroperitoneum in 1(2%). Membranous positivity for cluster of differentiation 99 was seen in 48(98%) cases. Nuclear positivity for Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor was seen in 39(78%) cases.

In this study, we identified the prognostic significance of MAP7 expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients (aged <60 years) based on several microarray datasets. In the first group (n = 129), high MAP7 expression (MAP7(high)) was associated with adverse overall survival (OS; P = 0.0441) and event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.0114) compared with low MAP7 expression (MAP7(low)). In addition, the prognostic significance of MAP7 was confirmed by European Leukemia Net (ELN) intermediate-I genetic categories and multivariable analysis. In the second independent group of CN-AML patients (aged <60 years), MAP7(high) was also associated with adverse OS (n = 88, OS; P = 0.00811). To understand the inherent mechanisms of MAP7's prognosis, we investigated genome-wide gene/microRNA expression signatures associated with MAP7 expression. Several known oncogenic genes/microRNAs and anti-oncogenic genes/microRNAs were disordered in MAP7(high) CN-AML patients. In conclusion, MAP7(high) is an adverse prognostic biomarker for CN-AML, which may be attributed to the distinctive genome-wide gene/microRNA expression and related cell signaling pathways.","['Fu, Lin', 'Fu, Huaping', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Xu, Keman', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Hu, Kai', 'Wang, Jing', 'Tian, Lei', 'Liu, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Jijun', 'Jing, Hongmei', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Shi, Jinlong']","['Fu L', 'Fu H', 'Zhou L', 'Xu K', 'Pang Y', 'Hu K', 'Wang J', 'Tian L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang J', 'Jing H', 'Huang W', 'Ke X', 'Shi J']","['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'College of Medical Laboratory Science and Technology, Harbin Medical University, Daqing, 163319, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5043276,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['srep34546 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34546 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 30;6:34546. doi: 10.1038/srep34546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Genomic DNA from 47 patients was extracted from peripheral blood and bone marrow using the EZ1 DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). After clinical history, cytogenetics, and molecular tests, patients were diagnosed with either clonal or nonclonal hematologic diseases. CALR screening was primarily performed using fragment analysis polymerase chain reaction, then next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 18 patients diagnosed with clonal diseases, one had acute myeloid leukemia (positive for trisomy 8), and 17 had myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and polycythemia vera (PV). Patients with CML were positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion. Ten patients were positive for JAK2 (PMF, n = 1; ET, n = 2; PV, n = 7), and three were CALR positive (ET, n = 1; PMF, n = 2). Patients diagnosed with a nonclonal disease were negative for JAK2, BCR-ABL, and CALR mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for CALR mutations is essential in BCR-ABL-negative MPNs since it not only provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information but also identifies potential treatment targets. Since this study describes the importance of screening for known and novel biomarkers, we described in detail three methods that could be easily integrated into a clinical laboratory.","['Gardner, Juli-Anne', 'Peterson, Jason D', 'Turner, Scott A', 'Soares, Barbara L', 'Lancor, Courtney R', 'Dos Santos, Luciana L', 'Kaur, Prabhjot', 'Ornstein, Deborah L', 'Tsongalis, Gregory J', 'de Abreu, Francine B']","['Gardner JA', 'Peterson JD', 'Turner SA', 'Soares BL', 'Lancor CR', 'Dos Santos LL', 'Kaur P', 'Ornstein DL', 'Tsongalis GJ', 'de Abreu FB']","['From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'Universidade Federal De Sao Joao Del Rei, Divinopolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'Universidade Federal De Sao Joao Del Rei, Divinopolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, gregory.j.tsongalis@hitchcock.org.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Calreticulin/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/genetics']",,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['aqw129 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqw129 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Oct;146(4):448-55. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw129.,,"['0 (Calreticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

We evaluate the performance of a monoclonal antibody for immunohistochemical detection of CALR mutations. METHODS: A computerized archival search was performed for cases of non-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) MPNs with available CALR and JAK2 V617F mutational analysis data. Bone marrow biopsy specimens were stained with monoclonal antibody CAL2, and the percentage of stained megakaryocytes was calculated. In select cases, double immunofluorescence staining was done with CAL2 and each of the following: CD61, myeloperoxidase, CD34, and glycophorin A. RESULTS: We studied 38 bone marrow biopsy specimens of non-CML MPNs (primary myelofibrosis, n = 21; essential thrombocythemia, n = 15; and n = 2 post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis) from 31 patients. All eight bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with mutant CALR showed strong cytoplasmic staining of the megakaryocytes (83.5%; range, 50%-98%; median, 87%) with the CAL2 antibody. Double immunofluorescence staining of the small mononuclear cells seen in CALR mutant cases revealed them to be myeloid blasts. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry in routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens for mutated CALR is feasible and accurately identifies mutated cases, including rare cases with additional driver mutations.","['Nomani, Laila', 'Bodo, Juraj', 'Zhao, Xiaoxian', 'Durkin, Lisa', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Nomani L', 'Bodo J', 'Zhao X', 'Durkin L', 'Loghavi S', 'Hsi ED']","['From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematopathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, hsie@ccf.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Calbindin 2/*metabolism', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2016/10/01 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['aqw135 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqw135 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Oct;146(4):431-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw135.,,"['0 (CALB2 protein, human)', '0 (Calbindin 2)', '0 (Calreticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

In controlled trials in CLL, ibrutinib produced high response rates and improved survival in both the frontline and relapsed settings. While ibrutinib controls CLL with impressive efficacy, it only infrequently induces complete remissions, particularly of relapsed CLL, and does not eradicate minimal residual disease. Finally, ibrutinib is extremely expensive, has off-target toxicities, and requires indefinite therapy. Areas covered: In this article, we provide an overview of the CLL therapeutic landscape and discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of ibrutinib. Major clinical trials of ibrutinib in CLL are summarized, and its safety profile explored. Expert opinion: Ibrutinib represents a transformative advance in CLL management and has validated BTK as a therapeutic target in this disease, but has some limitations, leading to the emergence of other BTK inhibitors and mechanism-based combination strategies. Given complete BTK occupancy at lower doses of ibrutinib and declining levels of BTK on ibrutinib therapy, lower doses of ibrutinib in CLL are being explored.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Gandhi, Varsha V', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Bose P', 'Gandhi VV', 'Keating MJ']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Experimental Therapeutics , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161011,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,,,PMC5391303,,2016/10/01 06:00,2016/10/01 06:01,['2016/10/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:01 [medline]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2016.1239717 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2016 Nov;12(11):1381-1392. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2016.1239717.

The clinical use of ponatinib is complicated by the possible development of cardiovascular events, primarily hypertension and arterial or venous thrombotic events. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency recommend that the cardiovascular profile of patients candidate for ponatinib should be carefully evaluated. For patients deemed to carry a high risk of cardiovascular events, other life-saving therapeutic options should be considered. When alternative options are not available, treatment with ponatinib is indicated but requires that haematologists and cardiologists collaborate and identify modalities of surveillance and risk mitigation in the best interest of the patient. This article reports on the expert opinion provided by a panel of Italian haematologists, cardiologists and clinical pharmacologists. It summarises suggestions that may help to improve the therapeutic index of ponatinib, primarily in the settings of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Spallarossa, Paolo', 'Arboscello, Eleonora', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Giorgi, Mauro', 'Grossi, Alberto', 'Mallardo, Mario', 'Nodari, Savina', 'Ottolini, Stefano', 'Sala, Carla', 'Tortorella, Giovanni', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Minotti, Giorgio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Breccia M', 'Pregno P', 'Spallarossa P', 'Arboscello E', 'Ciceri F', 'Giorgi M', 'Grossi A', 'Mallardo M', 'Nodari S', 'Ottolini S', 'Sala C', 'Tortorella G', 'Rosti G', 'Pane F', 'Minotti G', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University-Azienda Policlinico Umberto 1, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'S.C.

The aim was to study an influence of constitutional anomaly, Klinefelter syndrome, and additional structural rearrangements on the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a 32-year-old male patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was detected to have sex chromosomal abnormality during evaluation for Philadelphia chromosome. RESULTS: At diagnosis of CML, two clones were detected by standard cytogenetic investigation of bone marrow cells: 1) clone with translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), with two sex X chromosomes and absence sex chromosome Y; 2) clone with t(9;22) and unbalanced t(Y;20)(q11;q13). Analysis of blast transformed lymphocytes from peripheral blood showed karyotype 47,XXY. Monitoring of targeted therapy with second generation inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase indicated a cytogenetic remission and absence of BCR-ABL1 fusion signals after 11 months. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) in blast transformed T-lymphocytes at diagnosis of CML evidences that this translocation may appear not only at the level of multipotent haemopoietic cell progenitors but also may have oligo lineage myeloid origin. Presence of additional structural chromosomal abnormality in the clone with t(9;22)(q34;q11) does not affect the efficacy of therapy with the use of second generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor.","['Andreieva, S V', 'Korets, K V', 'Kyselova, O A', 'Ruzhinska, O E', 'Serbin, I M']","['Andreieva SV', 'Korets KV', 'Kyselova OA', 'Ruzhinska OE', 'Serbin IM']","['State Institution <<Institute of Haematology and Transfusiology of NAMS of Ukraine>>, Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', ""Government Institution <<The Scientific-Practical Children's Cardiac Centre the Ministry of Health Care of Ukraine>> (UCCC), Kyiv 04050, Ukraine."", 'State Institution <<Institute of Haematology and Transfusiology of NAMS of Ukraine>>, Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', ""Government Institution <<The Scientific-Practical Children's Cardiac Centre the Ministry of Health Care of Ukraine>> (UCCC), Kyiv 04050, Ukraine."", 'City Hospital No 9, Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['8733 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2016 Sep;38(3):195-7.,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endogenously produced FA is necessary for life and required for one-carbon transfer reactions; however, FA derived from external sources (exogenous FA), which may be in the form of methanol, may increase in vivo concentrations above naturally occurring physiological levels. Both endogenous and exogenous FA produce DNA monoadducts, DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links (DDX and DPX) but, when exposed to exogenously-derived free FA, DNA monoadducts, DDX, and DPX are only produced at initial sites of contact. In contrast, methanol may systemically induce DNA adducts distally. FA also induces oxidative stress/lipid peroxidation with some individuals suggesting the resulting reactive aldehydes may have the potential to induce distal site DNA damage with the resulting reactive aldehydes having the potential to induce distal site DNA damage. Chromosome changes in the form of aberrations or micronuclei in blood cells have been studied in FA-exposed animals and humans, with most of the former being negative. Human occupational studies have given mixed results for such changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) which circulate widely but do not reflect recent bone marrow (BM) events. Recent studies reporting changes in human BM or hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs) either have had confounding exposures or could not distinguish in vivo from in vitro occurrences. The reported genetic changes in circulating blood cells do not provide convincing support for FA's classification as a human leukemogen.","['Albertini, Richard J', 'Kaden, Debra A']","['Albertini RJ', 'Kaden DA']","['a Department of Pathology , University of Vermont , Burlington , VT , USA.', 'b Ramboll Environ US , Boston , MA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160811,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,IM,"['Blood Cells/*drug effects', 'Chromosomes/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2016.1211987 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2017 Feb;47(2):145-184. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2016.1211987.

Cross-resistance was observed between BEN, CLB and FLU, with previously treated patients or those with a deletion 17p being most resistant.

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and prognostic value of MK with retrospectively analyzed 119 patients newly diagnosed with childhood de novo AML. Ten patients (8.4%) revealed to have MK. All MK-positive (MK(+)) AML were associated with complex cytogenetic abnormalities and belonged to the cytogenetic adverse-risk group. Nine of MK(+) patients (90%) achieved complete remission. The event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of MK(+) adverse group were comparable to the ESF and OS of MK-negative non-adverse group (EFS 60.0+/-15.5% vs 59.0+/-5.1%, P=0.925; OS 70.0+/-14.5% vs 58.1+/-5.3%, P=0.696). In multivariate analysis, MK was not an independent adverse prognostic factor for EFS (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% C.I. 0.13-1.50, P=0.194). In addition, 7 of 9 MK(+) patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survived event-free, with a median follow-up of 64 months. In conclusion, MK did not act as an adverse prognostic factor in childhood de novo AML. Allogeneic HSCT might have contributed to the excellent outcome of MK(+) childhood de novo AML.","['Lee, Na Hee', 'Choi, Young Bae', 'Yi, Eun-Sang', 'Lee, Soo Hyun', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Yoo, Keon Hee']","['Lee NH', 'Choi YB', 'Yi ES', 'Lee SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JW', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Yoo KH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cha Bundang Medical Center, Cha University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Genome Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Medical Device Management and Research, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.

Interpretation of these tests is qualitative by nature and can yield trace, faint, or scarcely visible immunoglobulin bands (TFS), which can be difficult to classify. Whether these bands should be reported at all is challenging given their unknown clinical significance. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 14,036 physician-ordered protein SPE and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) tests on serum and urine specimens (from 4,091 patients) during the period of 2000-2010. We found that 17% of all IFE results evaluated for the presence of monoclonal gammopathies (2,389 out of 14,036) contained TFS bands, representing 4.2% (173 out of 4091) of all patients evaluated. Sixty of these patients (42%) had no previous history of gammopathy, and were clinically evaluated over a mean period of up to five years from the original diagnosis of plasma cell pathology. None of these patients had progressed to multiple myeloma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, plasmacytoma, or leukemia. The remaining 82 patients (58%) had a previous history of gammopathy, but had not progressed to any symptomatic plasma cell dyscrasia. Evaluation of these patients was followed for a median period of 4.3 years, with a mean of 21.5 IFE tests per individual. These data suggest that for patients without a previous history of gammopathy, the presence of TFS bands on serum protein electrophoresis does not warrant frequent follow up investigation as commonly practiced. Routine follow up of patients with a prior history of gammopathy, conversely, are warranted and may contribute to overall survival with multiple treatment options now available. For those interpreting IFE results, it may be worth considering these data when composing comments regarding suggested repeat testing frequency by SPE/IFE or alternate test methods.","['Gwathmey, TanYa M', 'Willis, Monte S', 'Tatreau, Jason', 'Wang, Shaobin', 'McCudden, Christopher R']","['Gwathmey TM', 'Willis MS', 'Tatreau J', 'Wang S', 'McCudden CR']","['Hypertension and Vascular Research Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem , NC, USA.', 'University of North Carolina , Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'University of North Carolina , School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'University of North Carolina , Department of Internal Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'The Ottawa Hospital , General Campus Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Ottawa, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150310,Italy,EJIFCC,EJIFCC,101092742,,,PMC4975357,,2015/03/01 00:00,2015/03/01 00:01,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,EJIFCC. 2015 Mar 10;26(2):114-24. eCollection 2015 Mar.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MGUS', 'faint', 'immunofixation', 'protein electrophoresis', 'serum', 'suspicious', 'trace', 'urine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of any type of laboratory MDR assay is to reliably identify such patients and to provide useful data to clinicians with a relatively short turnaround time. MDR can be multicausal and several previous data identified a group of transmembrane proteins - the ATP-binding casette (ABC) proteins - that may be involved in MDR in various hematological malignancies. The prototype of these proteins is the P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1, ABCB1) that is a seven-membrane spanning transmembrane protein capable of extruding several cytotoxic drugs that are of key importance in the treatment of hematological disorders. Similarly other ABC proteins - Multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (ABCC1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) are both capable of pumping out cytotoxic drugs. Here, we present flow cytometric methods to identify MDR proteins by antigen and activity assays. The advantage of flow technology is the short turnaround time and its relative easiness compared to nucleic acid based technologies. However, for the activity assays, it should be noted, that these functional tests require live cells, thus adequate results can only be provided if the specimen transport can be completed within 6 hours of sample collection. Identification of MDR proteins provides prognostic information and may modulate therapy, thus signifies a clinically useful information in the evaluation of patients with leukemias.","['Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsa', 'Apjok, Andras', 'Jakab, Katalin Tauberne']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Hevessy Z', 'Apjok A', 'Jakab KT']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen , Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen , Hungary.', 'Solvo Biotechnology , Szeged, Hungary.', 'Solvo Biotechnology , Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130116,Italy,EJIFCC,EJIFCC,101092742,,,PMC4975307,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,EJIFCC. 2013 Jan 16;23(4):117-23. eCollection 2013 Jan.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['drug-resistance', 'flow cytometry', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their exact etiology is unknown. Myelodysplastic syndromes cause progressive bone marrow failure resulting in pancytopenia and refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia. One can observe typical morphological alterations in the erythroid, myeloid and/or megakaryocytic cell lineage. Blast counts may also be increased. The pathologic cells are genetically unstable, and a myelodysplastic syndrome might transform into acute myeloid leukemia. The overall survival of these diseases range between few months to around ten years. Correct diagnosis and accurate prognostic classification is essential. In the past decades several scoring systems were established beginning with the French-American-British classification to the most recent Revised International Prognostic Scoring System. In all of these classifications bone marrow morphology is still the most important factor, though nowadays the genetic aberrations and flow cytometry findings are also included.

They have potential applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring of disease progression and measuring response to treatment. This type of information is particularly useful in the individualisation of treatment regimens. Biomarkers may take many forms but considerable effort has been made to identify and quantify proteins in biological fluids. However, a major challenge in measuring protein in biological fluids, such as plasma, is the sensitivity of the assay and the complex matrix of proteins present. Furthermore, determining the effect of proteases in disease requires measurement of their activity in biological fluids as quantification of the protein itself may not provide sufficient information. To date little progress has been made towards monitoring activity of proteases in plasma. The protease asparaginyl endopeptidase has been implicated in diseases such as breast cancer, leukaemia and dementia. Here we describe a new approach to sensitively and in a targeted fashion quantify asparaginyl endopeptidase activity in plasma using a synthetic substrate peptide protected from nonspecific hydrolysis using D-amino acids within the structure. Our selected reaction monitoring approach enabled asparaginyl endopeptidase activity to be measured in human plasma with both a high dynamic range and sensitivity. This manuscript describes a paradigm for future development of assays to measure protease activities in biological fluids as biomarkers of disease.","['Dutta, Anindita', 'Potier, David N', 'Walker, Michael J', 'Gray, Oliver J', 'Parker, Catriona', 'Holland, Mark', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Unwin, Richard D', 'Krishnan, Shekhar', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Dutta A', 'Potier DN', 'Walker MJ', 'Gray OJ', 'Parker C', 'Holland M', 'Williamson AJ', 'Pierce A', 'Unwin RD', 'Krishnan S', 'Saha V', 'Whetton AD']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Kolkata, India.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', ""Children's Cancer Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."", ""Children's Cancer Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."", 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Current address: Centre for Advanced Discovery and Experimental Therapeutics, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Human Development, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Kolkata, India.', ""Children's Cancer Group, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."", 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Body Fluids/*enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC5342591,,2016/09/30 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['12224 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12224 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 25;7(43):70822-70831. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12224.,"['MR/M008959/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/N00583X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.34 (asparaginylendopeptidase)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AEP', 'SRM', 'biomarker', 'legumain', 'protease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients ages 1 to 17 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated according to modified ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (IC-BFM) 2002 protocol. Risk classification was based on age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype, genetics (when available), and early response to therapy. RESULTS: From July 2007 to June 2014, 787 patients were treated, including 160 who had standard-risk ALL, 450 who had intermediate-risk ALL, and 177 who had high-risk ALL. The induction death rate was 6.6%, and the remission rate was 92.9%. The rates of death and treatment abandonment during first complete remission were 4.8% and 2.5%, respectively. At a median observation time of 3.6 years, and with abandonment considered an event, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival estimates ( +/- standard error) were 56.2% +/- 2.1% and 64.1% +/- 2.1%, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 28.9% +/- 2.0%. Twenty-one of 281 patients (7.5%) investigated were positive for the ets variant 6/runt-related transcription factor 1 (ETV6/RUNX1) fusion. CONCLUSIONS: A well organized center in a low-middle-income country can overcome the disadvantages of malnutrition and reduce abandonment. Outcomes remain suboptimal because of late diagnosis, early death, and a high relapse rate, which may have a partly genetic basis. Earlier diagnosis, better management of complications, and better knowledge of ALL will improve outcomes. Cancer 2017;123:436-448.

One-third of patients harbored damaging mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes, including the putative novel driver DOT1L (n=4). Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway mutations were found in two-thirds of patients, including novel mutations in ROS1, which mediates phosphorylation of the PTPN11-encoded protein SHP2. Mutations in FLT3 significantly co-occurred with DOT1L (p=0.04), suggesting functional cooperation in leukemogenesis. We detected an extraordinary level of tumor heterogeneity, with microclonal (mutant allele fraction <0.10) KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and/or PTPN11 hotspot mutations evident in 31/57 (54.4%) patients. Multiple KRAS and NRAS codon 12 and 13 microclonal mutations significantly co-occurred within tumor samples (p=4.8x10-4), suggesting ongoing formation of and selection for Ras-activating mutations. Future work is required to investigate whether tumor microheterogeneity impacts clinical outcome and to elucidate the functional consequences of epigenetic dysregulation in HD-ALL, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.","['de Smith, Adam J', 'Ojha, Juhi', 'Francis, Stephen S', 'Sanders, Erica', 'Endicott, Alyson A', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Smirnov, Ivan', 'Termuhlen, Amanda M', 'Walsh, Kyle M', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['de Smith AJ', 'Ojha J', 'Francis SS', 'Sanders E', 'Endicott AA', 'Hansen HM', 'Smirnov I', 'Termuhlen AM', 'Walsh KM', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', '*Mutation', 'Oncogenes', '*Polyploidy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5341940,,2016/09/30 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['12238 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12238 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):72733-72745. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12238.,"['P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA151022/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DOT1L', 'high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'microclonal mutations', 'targeted deep-sequencing', 'tumor heterogeneity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much less is known about the characteristics of the hematopoietic hierarchy of subgroups of MDS with a high risk of transforming to AML. Immunophenotypic analysis of immature stem and progenitor cell compartments from patients with an isolated loss of the entire chromosome 7 (isolated -7), an independent high-risk genetic event in MDS, showed expansion and dominance of the malignant -7 clone in the granulocyte and macrophage progenitors (GMP), and other CD45RA+ progenitor compartments, and a significant reduction of the LIN-CD34+CD38low/-CD90+CD45RA- hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, highly reminiscent of what is typically seen in AML, and distinct from low-risk MDS. Established functional in vitro and in vivo stem cell assays showed a poor readout for -7 MDS patients irrespective of marrow blast counts. Moreover, while the -7 clone dominated at all stages of GM differentiation, the -7 clone had a competitive disadvantage in erythroid differentiation. In azacitidine-treated -7 MDS patients with a clinical response, the decreased clonal involvement in mononuclear bone marrow cells was not accompanied by a parallel reduced clonal involvement in the dominant CD45RA+ progenitor populations, suggesting a selective azacitidine-resistance of these distinct -7 progenitor compartments. Our data demonstrate, in a subgroup of high risk MDS with monosomy 7, that the perturbed stem and progenitor cell compartments resemble more that of AML than low-risk MDS.","['Dimitriou, Marios', 'Woll, Petter S', 'Mortera-Blanco, Teresa', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Wedge, David C', 'Doolittle, Helen', 'Douagi, Iyadh', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Dimitriou M', 'Woll PS', 'Mortera-Blanco T', 'Karimi M', 'Wedge DC', 'Doolittle H', 'Douagi I', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Computational Oncology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute, New York, NY, United States of America.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5341937,,2016/09/30 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['12234 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12234 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):72685-72698. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12234.,"['MC_PC_12020/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/5/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['azacitidine', 'cancer stem cells', 'monosomy 7', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with hematological malignancies undergoing conventional chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are considered at high risk, and Aspergillus spp. represents the most frequently isolated micro-organisms. In the last years, attention has also been focused on other rare molds (e.g., Zygomycetes, Fusarium spp.) responsible for devastating clinical manifestations. The extensive use of antifungal prophylaxis has reduced the infections from yeasts (e.g., candidemia) even though they are still associated with high mortality rates. This paper analyzes concurrent multiple predisposing factors that could favor the onset of fungal infections. Although neutropenia is common to almost all hematologic patients, other factors play a key role in specific patients, in particular in patients with AML or allogeneic HSCT recipients. Defining those patients at higher risk of IFIs may help to design the most appropriate diagnostic work-up and antifungal strategy.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Tumbarello, Mario', 'Nosari, Annamaria', 'Aversa, Franco']","['Pagano L', 'Busca A', 'Candoni A', 'Cattaneo C', 'Cesaro S', 'Fanci R', 'Nadali G', 'Potenza L', 'Russo D', 'Tumbarello M', 'Nosari A', 'Aversa F']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica S.

METHODS: Prospective consecutive case series of seven treatment-naive patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (n = 2), polycythemia vera (n = 4), essential thrombocytosis (n = 1) examined before and after cytoreductive treatment. We investigated retinal circulation with motion-contrast imaging, retinal oximetry and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Retinal venous blood velocity increased by 8.14% (CI95 3.67% to 12.6%, p = 0.004) and retinal arterial oxygen saturation increased by 7.23% (CI95 2.9% to 11.6%, p = 0.010) at follow-up (mean 12 weeks, range 5-14 weeks) where complete haematological remission had been achieved by cytoreductive treatment. Abnormal optical coherence tomography reflectivity patterns were present at baseline in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and were replaced by normal patterns at follow-up. Retinopathy, in the form of cotton-wool spots and retinal haemorrhages, was found at presentation in the two patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and in one patient with polycythemia vera. The retinopathy had resolved at follow-up in all patients. CONCLUSION: With non-invasive retinal imaging, we were able to demonstrate increased retinal venous blood velocity, increased retinal arterial blood oxygenation and normalization of intravascular reflectivity patterns after successful treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Larger prospective studies are needed to assess the prognostic value of these non-invasive imaging methods in predicting circulatory complications in myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Willerslev, Anne', 'Hansen, Mathias M', 'Klefter, Oliver Niels', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Hasselbalch, Hans C', 'Clemmensen, Stine N', 'Larsen, Michael', 'Munch, Inger Christine']","['Willerslev A', 'Hansen MM', 'Klefter ON', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Clemmensen SN', 'Larsen M', 'Munch IC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160929,England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regional Blood Flow/*physiology', 'Retinal Vessels/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Tomography, Optical Coherence/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/aos.13249 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2017 Mar;95(2):146-152. doi: 10.1111/aos.13249.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Whole-body dual energy computed tomography (DECT) images of cadavers and leukemia patients were acquired, segmented to separate bone marrow components, namely, bone, red marrow (RM), and yellow marrow (YM). DECT-derived marrow fat fraction was validated using histology of lumbar vertebrae obtained from cadavers. The fractions of RM (RMF = RM/total marrow) and YMF were calculated in each skeletal region to assess the correlation of marrow composition with sites and ages. Treatment planning was simulated to target irradiation differentially at a higher dose (18 Gy) to either RM or YM and a lower dose (12 Gy) to the rest of the skeleton. RESULTS: A significant correlation between fat fractions obtained from DECT and cadaver histology samples was observed (r=0.861, P<.0001, Pearson). The RMF decreased in the head, neck, and chest was significantly inversely correlated with age but did not show any significant age-related changes in the abdomen and pelvis regions. Conformity of radiation to targets (RM, YM) was significantly dependent on skeletal sites. The radiation exposure was significantly reduced (P<.05, t test) to organs at risk (OARs) in RM and YM irradiation compared with standard total marrow irradiation (TMI). CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body DECT offers a new imaging technique to visualize and measure skeletal-wide marrow composition. The DECT-based treatment planning offers volumetric and site-specific precise radiation dosimetry of RM and YM, which varies with aging. Our proposed method could be used as a functional compartment of TMI for further targeted radiation to specific bone marrow environment, dose escalation, reduction of doses to OARs, or a combination of these factors.","['Magome, Taiki', 'Froelich, Jerry', 'Takahashi, Yutaka', 'Arentsen, Luke', 'Holtan, Shernan', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Brown, Keenan', 'Haga, Akihiro', 'Nakagawa, Keiichi', 'Holter Chakrabarty, Jennifer L', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Wong, Jeffrey', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn', 'Storme, Guy', 'Hui, Susanta K']","['Magome T', 'Froelich J', 'Takahashi Y', 'Arentsen L', 'Holtan S', 'Verneris MR', 'Brown K', 'Haga A', 'Nakagawa K', 'Holter Chakrabarty JL', 'Giebel S', 'Wong J', 'Dusenbery K', 'Storme G', 'Hui SK']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Komazawa University, Tokyo, Japan; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Department of Radiology, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Department of Radiation Oncology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Mindways Software Inc, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Radiology, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'College of Medicine, Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Comprehensive Cancer Center M.

The in silico investigation was based on the prediction of electronic, steric and lipohydrophilic features. The molecules were screened against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis CIT03, M. smegmatis ATCC 700084, M. kansasii DSM 44162, M. marinum CAMP 5644, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, methicillin-resistant S. aureus 63718, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Candida albicans CCM 8261, C. parapsilosis CCM 8260 and C. krusei CCM 8271, respectively, by standardized microdilution methods. The eventual antiproliferative (cytotoxic) impact of those compounds was examined on a human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line, as a part of the biological study. Promising potential against M. kansasii was found for 1-[3-(3-ethoxyphenylcarbamoyl)oxy-2-hydroxypropyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)pip erazin-1-ium chloride (MIC = 31.75 muM), which was comparable to the activity of isoniazid (INH; MIC = 29.17 muM). Moreover, 1-{2-hydroxy-3-(3-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)oxy)propyl}-4-(4-fluorophenyl)piperazin- 1-ium chloride was even more effective (MIC = 17.62 muM) against given mycobacterium. Among the tested N-arylpiperazines, 1-{2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)oxy)propyl}-4-(3-trifluorometh-ylphenyl) piperazin-1-ium chloride was the most efficient against M. marinum (MIC = 65.32 muM). One of the common features of all investigated substances was their insignificant antiproliferative (i.e., non-cytotoxic) effect. The study discussed structure-antimicrobial activity relationships considering electronic, steric and lipophilic properties.","['Malik, Ivan', 'Csollei, Jozef', 'Jampilek, Josef', 'Stanzel, Lukas', 'Zadrazilova, Iveta', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Cizek, Alois', 'Coffey, Aidan', ""O'Mahony, Jim""]","['Malik I', 'Csollei J', 'Jampilek J', 'Stanzel L', 'Zadrazilova I', 'Hosek J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Cizek A', 'Coffey A', ""O'Mahony J""]","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava SK-832 32, Slovak Republic. malikivan001@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, Brno CZ-612 42, Czech Republic. csolleij@cfu.cz.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava SK-832 32, Slovak Republic. josef.jampilek@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava SK-832 32, Slovak Republic. lukasstanzel@gmail.com.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, Brno CZ-612 42, Czech Republic. zadrazilova.iveta@seznam.cz.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, Brno CZ-612 42, Czech Republic. hhosek@gmail.com.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, Brno CZ-612 42, Czech Republic. sharka.pospisilova@gmail.com.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, Brno CZ-612 42, Czech Republic. cizeka@vfu.cz.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Cork Institute of Technology, Bishopstown, Cork T12 P928, Ireland. aidan.coffey@cit.ie.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Cork Institute of Technology, Bishopstown, Cork T12 P928, Ireland. jim.omahony@cit.ie.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160926,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,,,PMC6273431,,2016/09/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:01,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:01 [medline]']","['molecules21101274 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules21101274 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2016 Sep 26;21(10). pii: molecules21101274. doi: 10.3390/molecules21101274.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mycobacterium kansasii', 'Mycobacterium marinum', 'N-arylpiperazines', 'electronic properties', 'lipophilicity', 'structure-activity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, available evidence can provide guidance on strategies to assess and categorize fitness. Evidence is strongest to guide identification of ""frail"" older adults at the time of diagnosis based on performance status, physical function, and comorbidity. Many older adults, with adequate performance status and comorbidity burden, however, may be better characterized as ""vulnerable"". These patients have subclinical impairments that limit resilience when stressed with intensive therapies. More sensitive assessment strategies are needed to differentiate fit and vulnerable older adults regardless of chronologic age. Research is ongoing to identify tools and approaches, such as geriatric assessment, that can enhance characterization of fitness for AML therapies. This review will highlight available evidence for assessment of fitness among older adults with AML and discuss implications for practice and research.","['Klepin, Heidi D']",['Klepin HD'],"['Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA. hklepin@wakehealth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/complications', 'Comorbidity', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/pathology/*therapy']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-016-0348-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-016-0348-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2016 Dec;11(6):537-544. doi: 10.1007/s11899-016-0348-8.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Elderly', '*Fitness', '*Geriatric assessment', '*Older']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA-binding protein Helios (known as IKZF2), a member of the Ikaros family of Kruppel-like zinc-finger proteins, functions pivotally in T-cell differentiation and activation. In this study, we identify three novel short Helios splice variants which are T-cell leukemic specific, and demonstrate their dominant-negative function. We then test the cellular localization of distinct Helios isoforms, as well as their capability to form heterodimer with Ikaros, and the association with complexes comprising histone deacetylase (HDAC). In addition, the ectopic expression of T-cell leukemic Helios isoforms interferes with T-cell proliferation and apoptosis. The gene expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated the enrichment of signaling pathways essential for gene expression, translation, cell cycle checkpoint, and response to DNA damage stimulus. These data indicate the molecular function of Helios to be involved in the leukemogenesis and phenotype of T-cell leukemia, and also reveal Helios deregulation as a novel marker for T-cell leukemia.","['Zhao, Shaorong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Li, Yinghui', 'Liu, Pengjiang', 'Li, Shufang', 'Dou, Daolei', 'Wang, Yue', 'Yang, Rongcun', 'Xiang, Rong', 'Liu, Feifei']","['Zhao S', 'Liu W', 'Li Y', 'Liu P', 'Li S', 'Dou D', 'Wang Y', 'Yang R', 'Xiang R', 'Liu F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, Tianjin 300308, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First-Central Hospital, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Chemical Biology, Tianjin 300070, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160928,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,,PMC5040427,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0163328 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-17890 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Sep 28;11(9):e0163328. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163328. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients undergoing cancer treatment in the Pediatric Unit of Mato Grosso Cancer Hospital were selected. The inclusion criteria of volunteers were being under chemotherapy in the saliva collection period, age between 2 and 18 years, collaborate with the protocol for clinical examination and saliva collection, and responsible have given their written consent. For the realization of lactobacilli and Streptococcus mutans count in the patients' saliva, respectively, Dentalcult I and II (LaborClin; ) kits were used. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the association of the variables age group, prevalence of lactobacilli and S. mutans, diagnosis of patients, presence and level of decay of patients defined by decayed, filled, and missing teeth (DMFT)/dmft indexes with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: The group of patients consisted of 27 children, 15 males, and 12 females; 44% were aged between 6 and 10 years; 61% had present or past history of caries (dmft/DMFT >0); 48% had low value for Dentalcult I; 59% presented value grade 0 to Dentalcult II; and 63% were diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia. CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of dental caries in the study population but low rates of S. mutans and lactobacilli in the saliva of the children. Lactobacilli rate was significantly associated with caries index scores, and the prevalence of caries was directly associated with the age group of the children.","['Volpato, Luiz Evaristo Ricci', 'Kloster, Annelyze Podolan', 'Nunes, Lenieser Fajardo', 'Pedro, Fabio Luis Miranda', 'Borges, Alvaro Henrique']","['Volpato LE', 'Kloster AP', 'Nunes LF', 'Pedro FL', 'Borges AH']","[""Master's Program in Integrated Dental Scieces, Cuiaba, Brazil."", 'Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Cuiaba Dental School, University of Cuiaba, Cuiaba, Brazil.', ""Master's Program in Integrated Dental Scieces, Cuiaba, Brazil."", ""Master's Program in Integrated Dental Scieces, Cuiaba, Brazil."", ""Master's Program in Integrated Dental Scieces, Cuiaba, Brazil.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent,Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,8710631,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DMF Index', 'Dental Caries/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus/growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Male', '*Microbiota', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Oral Health', 'Pilot Projects', '*Prevalence', 'Saliva/microbiology', 'Streptococcus mutans/growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Tooth Loss']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JIndianSocPedodPrevDent_2016_34_4_370_191423 [pii]', '10.4103/0970-4388.191423 [doi]']",ppublish,J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent. 2016 Oct-Dec;34(4):370-6. doi: 10.4103/0970-4388.191423.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon entry, nuclear domain 10 (ND10) converges at the incoming DNA and represses viral gene expression. ICP0 contains a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades the ND10 organizer PML and disperses ND10 to alleviate the repression. In the present study, we focused on understanding the regulation of ICP0 E3 ligase activity in the degradation of different ICP0 substrates. We report the following. (i) A SUMO interaction motif located at ICP0 residues 362 to 364 is required for the degradation of PML isoforms II, IV, and VI but not isoform I. This differentiation mechanism exists in both HEp-2 and U2OS cells, regardless of the cell's permissiveness to the ICP0-null virus. (ii) Physical interaction between SIM362-364 and PML II is necessary but not sufficient for PML II degradation. Both proximal sequences surrounding SIM362-364 and distal sequences located at the ICP0 C terminus enhance the degradation of PML II. (iii) The ICP0 C terminus is dispensable for PML I degradation. Instead, bipartite PML I binding domains located in the N-terminal half of ICP0 coordinate to promote the degradation of PML I. (iv) The stability of ICP0, but not its ND10 fusion ability, affects the rate of PML I degradation. Taken together, our results show that ICP0 uses at least two regulatory mechanisms to differentiate its substrates. The disparate recognition of the ICP0 E3 substrates may be related to the different roles these substrates may play in HSV-1 infection. IMPORTANCE: Viruses have a limited genetic coding capacity but must encounter a multilayered comprehensive host defense. To establish a successful infection, viruses usually produce multifunctional proteins to coordinate the counteractions. Here we report that an HSV-1 protein, ICP0, can recognize individual host factors and target them differently for destruction. We identified elements that are important for the ICP0 E3 ubiquitin ligase to differentially recognize two of its substrates, PML I and PML II. This is the first study that has systematically investigated how ICP0 discriminates two similar molecules by very different mechanisms. This work lays the foundation for understanding the role of host defensive factors and the mechanisms viruses use to take advantage of some host proteins while destroying others.","['Zheng, Yi', 'Samrat, Subodh Kumar', 'Gu, Haidong']","['Zheng Y', 'Samrat SK', 'Gu H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA haidong.gu@wayne.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161114,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sumoylation', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC5110152,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01636-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01636-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Nov 14;90(23):10875-10885. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01636-16.

As substantial differences between the entities are observed regarding correlation to age and survival, we suggest evaluation of both TP53 deletion and mutation status.","['Stengel, A', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, T', 'Meggendorfer, M', 'Fasan, A', 'Haferlach, C']","['Stengel A', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Fasan A', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160929,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/*mortality', 'Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016263 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.263 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):705-711. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.263.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Pretreatment serum levels of Inhibin B and testosterone are significantly reduced in boys with newly diagnosed cancer, compared to reference values. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Disease-related gonadal impairment has been demonstrated in girls and young women diagnosed with cancer, prior to therapy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a descriptive study in boys newly diagnosed with cancer between January 2006 and February 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Serum Inhibin B and testosterone levels were determined in 224 boys, up to the age of 18 years, with newly diagnosed cancer prior to therapy. Hormone levels were compared with age-matched reference values. The cohort consisted of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lym-phoma (NHL), nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma and sarcoma. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: This study demonstrates reduced serum levels of Inhibin B in boys with newly diagnosed cancer, compared to reference values (standard deviation score (SDS) -0.9, P < 0.001). Median Inhibin B level in patients was 103.5 ng/l (range 20-422). Of all patients, 78.6% showed Inhibin B levels below the 50th percentile, and 58.5% had Inhibin B levels below the 25th percentile. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower than the reference range population (SDS -1.2, P < 0.001). Median testosterone level in pubertal patients was 7.3 nmol/l (range 0.1-23.6). No correlation with clinical signs of general illness and hormone levels were observed. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In this study, reproductive hormone levels were compared with age-matched reference values. Future studies may compare reproductive hormone levels with case controls. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Future longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether pretreatment impaired gonadal function at the time of cancer diagnosis is an important determinant of ultimate recovery of spermatogenesis after treatment and later on in adulthood.

Abundant mast cells (MCs) were observed in the tumor microenvironment and mediators released upon MC activation play an important role in the process of chronic inflammation. Previously, we found that activation of intestine mucosal MCs recruited and modulated the inflammatory CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells to promote the CRC development. In the current study we investigated the effects of Vam3, a resveratrol dimer with potent anti-inflammatory effects, on CRC development. METHODS: RBL-2H3 cells, a basophilic leukemia cell line, were pretreated with 2.5 or 5 microM Vam3 and then stimulated with dinitrophenol-conjugated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The MC degranulation was determined by measuring beta-hexosaminidase release. Generation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in RBL-2H3 cells or in peritoneal macrophages was determined by ELISA and real-time qPCR. NF-kappaB p65 and phospho-NF-kappaB p65 expression was determined by Western blotting. NF-kappaB activity in RAW264.7 cells was determined by luciferase reporter assay. CRC was induced in C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM), followed by oral exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Vam3 at 50 mg/kg, or disodium cromoglycate (DSCG, MC stabilizer) at 100 mg/kg, or vehicle were administrated to the mice 4 weeks after DSS withdrawal. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and mouse MC protease-1 were determined by ELISA. Infiltration of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis. One-way ANOVA was used to compare difference between groups. RESULTS: Pretreatment with Vam3 significantly inhibited RBL-2H3 cell degranulation and inflammatory cytokine production from RBL-2H3 cells and from peritoneal macrophages. After Vam3 treatment, NF-kappaB activity in RAW264.7 cells, and expressions of phospho-NF-kappaB p65 in RBL-2H3 cells and in peritoneal macrophages were significantly down-regulated. In the AOM plus DSS-induced CRC murine model, the Vam3 and DSCG-treated mice had less tumor numbers than those treated with vehicle. Expression of phospho-NF-kappaB p65, production of inflammatory cytokines, and infiltration of MCs and CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells were attenuated in the Vam3-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Vam3 treatment could attenuate the CRC development. This effect may be due to its inhibition on NF-kappaB signaling pathway in MCs and macrophages of the inflamed intestines.","['Xuan, Lingling', 'Jiang, Rentao', 'Wu, Zhiyuan', 'Yi, Honggan', 'Yao, Chunsuo', 'Hou, Qi', 'Qu, Chunfeng']","['Xuan L', 'Jiang R', 'Wu Z', 'Yi H', 'Yao C', 'Hou Q', 'Qu C']","['Department of Immunology, Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical CollegeBeijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical CollegeBeijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,PMC5020048,,2016/09/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:01,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2016.00311 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2016 Sep 13;7:311. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2016.00311. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD11b+Gr1+ cells', 'NF-kappaB', 'colitis-related colon cancer', 'inflammation', 'mast cells', 'natural compounds']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the detection, non-quantitative PCR assay has been reported, but its usefulness and limitations remain unclear. To our knowledge, quantitative PCR assay using paraffin tumor sections has not been reported. Using paraffin sections from ATLLs and non-ATLL T-cell lymphomas, we first performed non-quantitative PCR for HTLV-1 provirus. Next, we determined tumor ratios and carried out quantitative PCR to obtain provirus copy numbers. The results were analyzed with a simple regression model and a novel criterion, cut-off using 95 % rejection limits. Our quantitative PCR assay showed an excellent association between tumor ratios and the copy numbers (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). The 95 % rejection limits provided a statistical basis for the range for the determination of HTLV-1 involvement. Its application suggested that results of non-quantitative PCR assay should be interpreted very carefully and that our quantitative PCR assay is useful to estimate the status of HTLV-1 involvement in the tumor cases. In conclusion, our quantitative PCR assay using paraffin tumor sections may be useful for the screening of ATLL cases, especially in HTLV-1 non-endemic areas where easy access to serological testing for HTLV-1 infection is limited.","['Kato, Junki', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Fujii, Keiichiro', 'Takino, Hisashi', 'Murase, Takayuki', 'Yonekura, Kentaro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi']","['Kato J', 'Masaki A', 'Fujii K', 'Takino H', 'Murase T', 'Yonekura K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ishida T', 'Iida S', 'Inagaki H']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan. hinagaki@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160927,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,"['Adult', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/*virology', 'Paraffin', 'Pathology, Molecular/*methods', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*genetics']",,,2016/10/28 06:00,2018/04/13 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pin.12462 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2016 Nov;66(11):618-621. doi: 10.1111/pin.12462.

CSCs are thought to play indispensable roles in the initiation, progression and metastasis of many types of cancer. Leukemias are thought to be initiated and maintained by a specific sub-type of CSC, the leukemia stem cell (LSC). An important feature of LSCs is their resistance to standard therapy, which may lead to relapse. Increasing efforts are aimed at developing novel therapeutic strategies that selectively target LSCs, while sparing their normal counterparts and, thus, minimizing adverse treatment-associated side-effects. These LSC targeting therapies aim to eradicate LSCs through affecting mechanisms that control their survival, self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation and cell cycle progression. Some LSC targeting therapies have already been proven successful in pre-clinical studies and they are now being tested in clinical studies, mainly in combination with conventional treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence indicates that the selective targeting of LSCs represents a promising approach to improve disease outcome. Beyond doubt, the CSC hypothesis has added a new dimension to the area of anticancer research, thereby paving the way for shaping a new trend in cancer therapy.","['Chavez-Gonzalez, Antonieta', 'Bakhshinejad, Babak', 'Pakravan, Katayoon', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Babashah, Sadegh']","['Chavez-Gonzalez A', 'Bakhshinejad B', 'Pakravan K', 'Guzman ML', 'Babashah S']","['Oncology Research Unit, National Medical Center, IMSS, Oncology Hospital, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

Herein we aimed to construct a method that could sensitively detect Siglec-5 by taking advantage of the high affinity and selectivity of the K19 aptamer for its cognate target, and the selective interaction of luminescent iridium(III) transition metal complexes with G-quadruplex DNA. The iridium(III) complex 1 [Ir(tpyd)2(2,9-dmphen)]PF6 (where tpyd =2-(m-tolyl)pyridine; 2,9-dmphen =2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) was synthesized, and it displayed high luminescence for G-quadruplex DNA compared to dsDNA and ssDNA. Additionally, complex 1 exhibited a blue shift luminescence response to c-kit2 G-quadruplex, and the interaction between 1 and G-quadruplexes was discussed based on the results of G-tetrad assay, loop effect assay, and other assays. Then complex 1 was utilized to develop a G-quadruplex-based sensing platform for Siglec-5 in aqueous solution. Upon the addition of Siglec-5, the specific binding of the K19 aptamer sequence results in a conformational change that generates a split G-quadruplex structure, which is then recognized by the G-quadruplex-specific iridium(III) complex with an enhanced luminescent response. Futhermore, the use of the assay for detecting Siglec-5 in cellular debris was demonstrated.","['Lin, Sheng', 'Lu, Lihua', 'Kang, Tian-Shu', 'Mergny, Jean-Louis', 'Leung, Chung-Hang', 'Ma, Dik-Lung']","['Lin S', 'Lu L', 'Kang TS', 'Mergny JL', 'Leung CH', 'Ma DL']","['Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University , Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China , 999077.', 'Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University , Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China , 999077.', 'College of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural University , Qingdao, China , 266109.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau , Macao, China , 999078.', 'INSERM, U1212, CNRS, UMR 5320, IECB, Pessac, France , 33607.', 'University of Bordeaux , ARNA Laboratory, Bordeaux, France , 33370.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau , Macao, China , 999078.', 'Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University , Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China , 999077.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161006,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,,,,2016/09/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:01,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:01 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03128 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2016 Oct 18;88(20):10290-10295. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03128.

Complex karyotype (CK), TP53 deletions and/or mutations (TP53 disruption), IGVH mutational status, and, more recently, recurrent somatic mutations have been identified as prognostic markers in CLL. On a cohort of 110 patients with CLL treated with first-line fludarabin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatment compared with 33 untreated (watch and wait) patients with CLL, we report more frequent complex karyotypes (34 vs 15%; P = .05), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 21%; P < .0001), ATM deletion (25 vs 6%, P = .02), and NOTCH mutation (3 vs 17%, P = .04). Among treated patients, 39 relapsed during the follow-up period. These patients were characterized before treatment by a higher incidence of trisomy 12 (38 vs 11%, P < .001) and TP53 disruption (31 vs 4%, P = .0002). A significantly shorter 5-year overall survival was found for treated patients with CK (72.4 vs 85.8%; P = .007), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 100%; P = .04), or TP53 disruption (55.7 vs 82.7%; P < .0001). Three risk groups were defined based on the status of TP53 disruption or unmutated IGVH, which differed significantly in terms of 5-year overall survival. Moreover, the presence of CK impacted pejoratively 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in all these 3 groups. Conventional karyotyping therefore appears to be of value, CK being an additional factor, undetectable in classical FISH, in patients with CLL at the stage when therapy becomes required.","['Le Bris, Yannick', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Guieze, Romain', 'Rouvellat, Caroline', 'Prade, Nais', 'Troussard, Xavier', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Le Bris Y', 'Struski S', 'Guieze R', 'Rouvellat C', 'Prade N', 'Troussard X', 'Tournilhac O', 'Bene MC', 'Delabesse E', 'Ysebaert L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Caen, Caen, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160928,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2349 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):664-670. doi: 10.1002/hon.2349.

However, allografts are associated with the risk of viral disease transmission. One of the viruses transmitted in this manner is human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which is found worldwide but is unevenly distributed. The southwestern parts of Japan are a highly endemic for HTLV-1. We investigated the HTLV-1 seroprevalence in candidate allograft donors at the regional bone bank in Kagoshima, Japan during its first 5 years of service. Between 2008 and 2012, we collected 282 femoral heads at the Kagoshima regional bone bank from living donors with osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Among the 282 candidate donors, 32 donors (11.3 %) were seropositive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody; notably, this prevalence is higher than that reported for blood donors in this area. Additionally, to determine if HTLV-1 genes are detectable after processing, we examined the bone marrow of the femoral heads from seropositive donors by conducting PCR assays. Our results confirm the existence of viral genes following the heat treatment processing of the femoral heads. Therefore, it is important to inactivate a virus completely by heat-treatment. Together, our findings highlight the importance of HTLV-1 screening at bone banks, particularly in HTLV-1-endemic areas such as southwest Japan.","['Ishidou, Yasuhiro', 'Matsuyama, Kanehiro', 'Matsuura, Eiji', 'Setoguchi, Takao', 'Nagano, Satoshi', 'Kakoi, Hironori', 'Hirotsu, Masataka', 'Kawamura, Ichiro', 'Yamamoto, Takuya', 'Komiya, Setsuro']","['Ishidou Y', 'Matsuyama K', 'Matsuura E', 'Setoguchi T', 'Nagano S', 'Kakoi H', 'Hirotsu M', 'Kawamura I', 'Yamamoto T', 'Komiya S']","['Departments of Medical Joint Materials, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan. ishidou@m2.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Departments of Medical Joint Materials, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Departments of Neurology and Geriatrics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'The Near-Future Locomotor Organ Medicine Creation Course, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Medical Joint Materials, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Medical Joint Materials, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'The Near-Future Locomotor Organ Medicine Creation Course, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160927,Netherlands,Cell Tissue Bank,Cell and tissue banking,100965121,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts/virology', 'Blood Donors', '*Bone Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Femur Head/virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Tissue Donors']",PMC5116038,"['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to this', 'study.']",2016/10/22 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10561-016-9586-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10561-016-9586-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Tissue Bank. 2016 Dec;17(4):555-560. doi: 10.1007/s10561-016-9586-1.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD), characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of multiple target organs, considerably contributes to the morbidity and mortality even years after allo-HSCT. Diagnosis of cGvHD is based on clinical features and histology of biopsies. Here, we report the generation of a urinary cGvHD-specific proteome-pattern (cGvHD_MS14) established by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to predict onset and severity of cGvHD as an unbiased laboratory test. cGvHD_MS14 was evaluated on samples from 412 patients collected prospectively in four transplant centers. Sensitivity and specificity was 84 and 76% by cGvHD_MS14 classification. Sensitivity further increased to 93% by combination of cGvHD_MS14 with relevant clinical variables to a logistic regression model. cGvHD was predicted up to 55 days prior to clinical diagnosis. Acute GvHD is not recognized by cGvHD_MS14. cGvHD_MS14 consists of 14 differentially excreted peptides, six of those have been sequenced to date and are fragments from thymosin beta-4, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4gamma2, fibrinogen beta-chain or collagens. In conclusion, the cGvHD_MS14-pattern allows early, highly sensitive and specific prediction of cGvHD as an independent diagnostic criterion of clinical diagnosis potentially allowing early therapeutic intervention.","['Weissinger, E M', 'Human, C', 'Metzger, J', 'Hambach, L', 'Wolf, D', 'Greinix, H T', 'Dickinson, A M', 'Mullen, W', 'Jonigk, D', 'Kuzmina, Z', 'Kreipe, H', 'Schweier, P', 'Bohm, O', 'Turuchanow, I', 'Ihlenburg-Schwarz, D', 'Raad, J', 'Durban, A', 'Schiemann, M', 'Konecke, C', 'Diedrich, H', 'Holler, E', 'Beutel, G', 'Krauter, J', 'Ganser, A', 'Stadler, M']","['Weissinger EM', 'Human C', 'Metzger J', 'Hambach L', 'Wolf D', 'Greinix HT', 'Dickinson AM', 'Mullen W', 'Jonigk D', 'Kuzmina Z', 'Kreipe H', 'Schweier P', 'Bohm O', 'Turuchanow I', 'Ihlenburg-Schwarz D', 'Raad J', 'Durban A', 'Schiemann M', 'Konecke C', 'Diedrich H', 'Holler E', 'Beutel G', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Stadler M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Mosaiques-Diagnostics, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria and Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria and Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Mosaiques-Diagnostics, Hannover, Germany.', 'Mosaiques-Diagnostics, Hannover, Germany.', 'Mosaiques-Diagnostics, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinikum Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160928,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Peptides/metabolism', '*Proteome', '*Proteomics/methods', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016259 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.259 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):654-662. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.259.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the survival of malignant cells is supported in vitro by nurse-like cells, which differentiate from CD14(+) monocytes and have been identified as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The role of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in CLL has been extensively studied in vitro, but only recently has been investigated in in vivo models. We here discuss how the cellular and molecular interactions that physiologically occur between B cells and macrophages can be subverted in chronic B lymphoid malignancies. Clinical approaches for the therapeutic targeting of TAMs are under evaluation. Promising strategies, along with a direct impact on the malignant cells, affect crucial pathways involved in the interaction of leukemic cells with TAMs. As an example, ibrutinib reduces CLL cell chemoattraction by inhibiting macrophage secretion of CXCL13. Lenalidomide and trabectedin prevent TAM recruitment mainly through CCL2 blockade. Most advanced strategies aim at depleting macrophages by targeting the CSF1/CSF1R pathway, which is fundamental for TAM survival. Of note, CSF1 transcripts are significantly more abundant in progressive CLL patients when compared with stable CLL and the frequency of CSF1R(+) TAMs correlates with poor survival in hematological malignancies. The successful combination of CSF1R inhibition with currently available agents targeting malignant cells might represent the next therapeutic frontier in CLL. Conceivably these approaches may become applicable to numerous chronic B lymphoid malignancies.","['Galletti, G', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Bertilaccio, M T S']","['Galletti G', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Bertilaccio MT']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160928,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology']",,,2016/09/30 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016261 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.261 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2293-2301. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.261.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp1-Cullin-1-Skp2 (SCF(Skp2)) promotes proteasomal degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 to enhance tumor growth. Increased SKP2 expression and reduced p27 levels are frequent in human cancers and are associated with therapeutic resistance. SCF(Skp2) activity is increased by the Cullin-1-binding protein Commd1 and the Skp2-binding protein Cks1B. Here we observed higher CUL1, COMMD1 and SKP2 mRNA levels in CD138(+) cells isolated from BTZ-resistant MM patients. Higher CUL1, COMMD1, SKP2 and CKS1B mRNA levels in patient CD138(+) cells correlated with decreased progression-free and overall survival. Genetic knockdown of CUL1, COMMD1 or SKP2 disrupted the SCF(Skp2) complex, stabilized p27 and increased the number of annexin-V-positive cells after BTZ treatment. Chemical library screens identified a novel compound, designated DT204, that reduced Skp2 binding to Cullin-1 and Commd1, and synergistically enhanced BTZ-induced apoptosis. DT204 co-treatment with BTZ overcame drug resistance and reduced the in vivo growth of myeloma tumors in murine models with survival benefit. Taken together, the results provide proof of concept for rationally designed drug combinations that incorporate SCF(Skp2) inhibitors to treat BTZ resistant disease.","['Malek, E', 'Abdel-Malek, M A Y', 'Jagannathan, S', 'Vad, N', 'Karns, R', 'Jegga, A G', 'Broyl, A', 'van Duin, M', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Cottini, F', 'Anderson, K C', 'Driscoll, J J']","['Malek E', 'Abdel-Malek MA', 'Jagannathan S', 'Vad N', 'Karns R', 'Jegga AG', 'Broyl A', 'van Duin M', 'Sonneveld P', 'Cottini F', 'Anderson KC', 'Driscoll JJ']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Department of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Department of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center and University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center and University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center and University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160928,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cullin Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', '*Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Small Molecule Libraries', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5339431,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016258 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.258 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):645-653. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.258.

However, MPN-MF often progresses (~20%) to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), where standard induction chemotherapy or ruxolitinib is relatively ineffective, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In the present studies, we demonstrate that treatment with BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) protein inhibitor (BETi), for example, JQ1, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of cultured and primary, patient-derived (PD), post-MPN sAML blast progenitor cells. Reverse-phase protein array, mass-cytometry and Western analyses revealed that BETi treatment attenuated the protein expressions of c-MYC, p-STAT5, Bcl-xL, CDK4/6, PIM1 and IL-7R, whereas it concomitantly induced the levels of HEXIM1, p21 and BIM in the sAML cells. Co-treatment with BETi and ruxolitinib synergistically induced apoptosis of cultured and PD sAML cells, as well as significantly improved survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with human sAML cells. Although BETi or heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i) alone exerted lethal activity, cotreatment with BETi and HSP90i was synergistically lethal against the ruxolitinib-persister or ruxolitinib-resistant sAML cells. Collectively, these findings further support in vivo testing of BETi-based combinations with JAKi and HSP90i against post-MPN sAML cells.","['Saenz, Dyana T', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Rajapakshe, Kimal', 'Krieger, Stephanie', 'Sun, Baohua', 'Mill, Christopher P', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Qiu, Peng', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Saenz DT', 'Fiskus W', 'Manshouri T', 'Rajapakshe K', 'Krieger S', 'Sun B', 'Mill CP', 'DiNardo C', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Kadia T', 'Parmar S', 'Sharma S', 'Coarfa C', 'Qiu P', 'Verstovsek S', 'Bhalla KN']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Center for Investigational Therapeutics, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Tech and Emory University, Atlanta, 30332.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX, 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160928,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, myc', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5345582,,2016/10/26 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/leu.2016.260 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):678-687. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.260.

All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), being the first choice drug for leukemia therapy is now under intense study for its therapeutic efficiency in other solid cancers. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to investigate the anti-metastasis activity of free ATRA and liposome entrapped ATRA (5:4:1) in the experimental C57BL/6 mice model developed by the injection of B16F10 cell line into the tail vein. METHOD: The ATRA drug was given via i.p for 21 days. The visual lung and liver metastatic tumor nodules were noted. Various biochemical markers of cancer metastasis in the serum as well as tissues were also analyzed after sacrifice. RESULTS: Tumor nodules have significantly decreased in ATRA treatment groups (32.83 +/- 1.83 for free ATRA, 23 +/- 2.36 for DSPC Lipo-ATRA) when compared with metastasis control (63.16 +/- 2.9) in the lungs. Among the treatment groups, the DSPC lipo-ATRA treated group showed a significant tumor growth inhibition (63.6%) than that of in the free ATRA treated groups (48%). Similar anti-metastatic effect was observed in liver also. Furthermore lipo-ATRA has shown a significant change in the levels of biochemical cancer markers analyzed in this study. CONCLUSION: Our results concluded that the liposome encapsulated ATRA has an enhanced anti-metastasis potency than the free ATRA during B16F10 metastatic cell line implantation.","['Reji, Reshma Mahima', 'Siddikuzzaman', 'V M, Berlin Grace']","['Reji RM', 'Siddikuzzaman', 'V M BG']","['Department of Biotechnology, Karunya University, Coimbatore-641 114, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Karunya University, Coimbatore-641 114, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Karunya University, Karunya Nagar, Coimbatore - 641 114.

Here, we investigated the ability of topoisomerase II (Top II) inhibitor etoposide (Eto) to target CML LSCs. Treatment with Eto combined with IM markedly induced apoptosis in primitive CML CD34(+) CD38(-) stem cells resistant to eradication by IM alone, but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells, CML and normal mature CD34(-) cells, and other leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. The interaction of IM and Eto significantly inhibited phosphorylation of PDK1, AKT, GSK3, S6, and ERK proteins; increased the expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax; and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic gene c-Myc in CML CD34(+) cells.

It is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, one of which -DNMT3A- is frequently mutated in human hematologic malignancies. We have previously reported that Dnmt3a inactivation in hematopoietic stem cells results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and CD8-positive peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) in EmuSRalpha-tTA;Teto-Cre;Dnmt3a(fl/fl); Rosa26LOXP(EGFP/EGFP) (Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta)) mice. The extent to which molecular changes overlap between these diseases is not clear. Using high resolution global methylation and expression analysis we show that whereas patterns of methylation and transcription in normal B-1a cells and CD8-positive T cells are similar, methylomes and transcriptomes in malignant B-1a and CD8+ T cells are remarkably distinct, suggesting a cell-type specific function for Dnmt3a in cellular transformation. Promoter hypomethylation in tumors was 10 times more frequent than hypermethylation, three times more frequent in CLL than PTCL and correlated better with gene expression than hypermethylation. Cross-species molecular comparison of mouse and human CLL and PTCL reveals significant overlaps and identifies putative oncogenic drivers of disease. Thus, Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) mice can serve as a new mouse model to study CLL and PTCL in relevant physiological settings.","['Haney, Staci L', 'Upchurch, Garland M', 'Opavska, Jana', 'Klinkebiel, David', 'Appiah, Adams Kusi', 'Smith, Lynette M', 'Heavican, Tayla B', 'Iqbal, Javeed', 'Joshi, Shantaram', 'Opavsky, Rene']","['Haney SL', 'Upchurch GM', 'Opavska J', 'Klinkebiel D', 'Appiah AK', 'Smith LM', 'Heavican TB', 'Iqbal J', 'Joshi S', 'Opavsky R']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'College of Public Health, UNMC, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'College of Public Health, UNMC, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.', 'Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160928,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5039761,,2016/09/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2016/09/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['srep34222 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34222 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 28;6:34222. doi: 10.1038/srep34222.,"['P30 GM106397/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA188561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We calculated survival among children with CML, acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 14 SEE (1990-2014) cancer registries and the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER, 1990-2012). We used Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 369 CML cases, substantial improvements were noted in 2-year survival during the post-TKI (range: 81-89%) compared to pre-TKI period (49-66%; HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23-0.60). Risk of death was three times higher for <5-year-old children versus those aged 10-14 years (HR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.85-4.94) and 56% higher for those living in SEE versus SEER (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.01-2.42). Regardless of geographic area and period of TKI administration, however, age seems to be a significant determinant of CML prognosis (pre-TKI period, HR0-4y: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.53-4.79; post-TKI period, HR0-4y: 3.38, 95% CI: 1.29-8.85). Noticeably, post-TKI survival in CML overall approximates that for ALL, whereas therapeutic advancements for AML remain modest. CONCLUSION: Registry data show that introduction of molecular therapies coincides with revolutionised therapeutic outcomes in childhood CML entailing dramatically improved survival which is now similar to that in ALL. Given that age disparities in survival remain substantial, offering optimal therapy to entire populations is an urgent priority.","['Karalexi, Maria A', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Ryzhov, Anton', 'Zborovskaya, Anna', 'Dimitrova, Nadya', 'Zivkovic, Snezana', 'Eser, Sultan', 'Antunes, Luis', 'Sekerija, Mario', 'Zagar, Tina', 'Bastos, Joana', 'Demetriou, Anna', 'Agius, Domenic', 'Florea, Margareta', 'Coza, Daniela', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Hatzipantelis, Emmanuel', 'Kourti, Maria', 'Graphakos, Stelios', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Adami, Hans Olov', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Karalexi MA', 'Baka M', 'Ryzhov A', 'Zborovskaya A', 'Dimitrova N', 'Zivkovic S', 'Eser S', 'Antunes L', 'Sekerija M', 'Zagar T', 'Bastos J', 'Demetriou A', 'Agius D', 'Florea M', 'Coza D', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Stiakaki E', 'Moschovi M', 'Hatzipantelis E', 'Kourti M', 'Graphakos S', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Adami HO', 'Petridou ET']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, Athens, 11527, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ""Pan & Agl.

Pluripotent stem cells are heterogeneous, consisting of naive stem cells as well as primed epiblast stem cells. However, the strategies and mechanisms of maintaining naive pluripotent stem cells remain unclear. In this study, we found that folic acid (FA) sustained mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and enabled long-term maintenance of the naive state of ESCs under CHIR99021 conditions. Mechanistic experiments showed that STAT3 pathway partially mediated the effect of FA after which the interaction between STAT3 and importin alpha5 was enhanced. Meanwhile, MEK/ERK signaling also acted downstream of FA in maintaining ESC pluripotency. Furthermore, FA significantly promoted mouse somatic cell reprogramming. Overall, our study identified an effective chemical condition for maintaining homogeneous ESCs and highlighted the important roles of LIF/STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling in naive ESC pluripotency.","['Wei, Tingyi', 'Jia, Wenwen', 'Qian, Zhen', 'Zhao, Liangyuan', 'Yu, Yangyang', 'Li, Lian', 'Wang, Chenxin', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Liu, Qi', 'Yang, Dandan', 'Wang, Guiying', 'Wang, Zikang', 'Wang, Kai', 'Duan, Tao', 'Kang, Jiuhong']","['Wei T', 'Jia W', 'Qian Z', 'Zhao L', 'Yu Y', 'Li L', 'Wang C', 'Zhang W', 'Liu Q', 'Yang D', 'Wang G', 'Wang Z', 'Wang K', 'Duan T', 'Kang J']","['1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '2 School of Pharmaceutical Science, Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '2 School of Pharmaceutical Science, Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .', '3 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '3 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai, China .', '1 Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161103,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Self Renewal/drug effects', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0091 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2017 Jan 1;26(1):49-59. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0091.

To evaluate the effects of fludarabine and cytarabine (FA) consolidation therapy for t(8;21) AML patients, a prospective randomized study was performed. A total of 45 patients with t(8;21) AML after achieving complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to receive four course consolidation with FA (n = 23) or HD-Ara-C (n = 22). Our study showed that at 36-months, relapse-free survival (RFS) was 81.73% in the FA arm and 50.73% in the HD-Ara-C arm (P = 0.04), overall survival (OS) was 91.1% and 48.4% (P = 0.01) in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively; whereas cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 18.27% and 47.39%, in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively (P = 0.05). In our study, treatment with FA, MRD2 status (reduction >/= 3-log) and absence of c-kit mutations were identified as independent prognostic factors for lower risk of relapse, improved RFS and OS. We also found RFS for patients without c-kit mutations was 100% in FA arm, and 57.8% in HD-Ara-C arm at 36 months (P = 0.005); OS of both groups at 36 months was 100% and 51.4%, respectively (P = 0.004), suggesting a benefit of consolidation therapy with FA for t(8;21) AML patients, especially, those without c-kit mutations (Clinicaltrials.org ID NCT# 02024308).

Buparlisib (BKM120) is an oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor. This phase I study was conducted to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BKM120 in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias. Fourteen pts (12 acute myeloid leukemia, 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 mixed phenotype leukemia) were enrolled. Twelve pts received BKM-120 80 mg/day and two 100 mg/day. The MTD was 80 mg/day. Of the 14 patients treated, the best response was stable disease in one patient that lasted 82 days. The median survival for all patients was 75 days (range 10-568). Three patients with a 3q26 chromosome abnormality had a significantly improved median survival of 360 days (range 278-568) as compared to a median survival of 57 days (range, 10-125) among the 11 other patients. The most frequent drug-related toxicities included confusion, mucositis, dysphagia, and fatigue. Western blot profiling revealed a decrease in p-pS6K/total pS6K in 5/7 (71%) available patient samples with a mean quantitative inhibition of 65% (range, 32-100%) and a decrease in p-FOXO3/total FOXO3 in 4/6 (67%) samples with a mean quantitative inhibition of 93% (range, 89-100%).

A total of 323 patients were identified. The median age was 43 years. Disease status at transplant was first complete remission (CR1) in 48.9%, CR2 in 21.7%, CR3 in 6.2%, while 23.2% of the patients had an active disease at the time of transplant. This was performed from a HLA-matched sibling (49.8%) or a matched-unrelated donor (51.2%). The incidence of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) (grade > II) was 26.6%, while chronic GvHD occurred in 35.9% of the patients at 1 year (24.6% with extensive disease). With a median follow-up of 16.8 months, the nonrelapse mortality was 12.4 and 25.3% at 100 days and 1 year, respectively. The relapse incidence at 1 year was 33.3% with no difference for patients in CR1 (27%). The one-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 57 and 66%, respectively for the entire cohort and 50 and 66%, respectively in patients in CR1. Thiotepa/busulfan +/- melphalan (n = 213) in comparison to thiotepa/other (n = 110) conditioning regimen resulted in higher relapse incidence at 1 year (34.9 vs. 30.3%, P = 0.016) and lower LFS (38.8 vs. 45.9%, P = 0.0203), while nonrelapse mortality (23.8 vs. 26.3%, n.s.) and OS (59.6 vs. 51.1%, P = 0.109) did not differ. This large study suggests that a thiotepa-based conditioning for allogeneic transplantation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is feasible and effective, with the main outcomes being comparable to those achieved with other regimens.

Indeed, hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway is associated with the disease aggressiveness, poor prognosis and resistance to current therapies. To identify a molecular pathway capable of cooperating with PTEN deficiency to drive oncogenic transformation of leukocytes, we performed an unbiased transformation screen with a library of tyrosine kinases. We found that activation of NTRK2 is able to confer a full growth phenotype of Ba/F3 cells in an IL3-independent manner in the PTEN-null setting. NTRK2 activation cooperates with PTEN deficiency through engaging both phosphoinositide3-kinase/AKT and JAK/STAT3 pathway activation in leukocytes. Notably, pharmacological inhibition demonstrated that p110alpha and p110delta are the major isoforms mediating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling driven by NTRK2 activation in PTEN-deficient leukemia cells. Furthermore, combined inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and STAT3 significantly suppressed proliferation of PTEN-mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia both in culture and in mouse xenografts. Together, our data suggest that a unique conjunction of PTEN deficiency and NTRK2 activation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and combined pharmacologic inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and STAT3 signaling may serve as an effective and durable therapeutic strategy for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Yuzugullu, Haluk', 'Von, Thanh', 'Thorpe, Lauren M', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Roberts, Thomas M', 'Frank, David A', 'Zhao, Jean J']","['Yuzugullu H', 'Von T', 'Thorpe LM', 'Walker SR', 'Roberts TM', 'Frank DA', 'Zhao JJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160920,England,Cell Discov,Cell discovery,101661034,,,PMC5029543,"['TMR is a consultant of Novartis and has received a research grant from Novartis.', 'The remaining authors declare no competing financial interests.']",2016/09/28 06:00,2016/09/28 06:01,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/celldisc.2016.30 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Discov. 2016 Sep 20;2:16030. doi: 10.1038/celldisc.2016.30. eCollection 2016.,"['P01 CA142536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA187918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NTRK2', 'PI3K', 'PTEN', 'STAT-3', 'T-ALL', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MF is also characterized by a state of chronic inflammation. Calreticulin (CRT), as a multifunctional protein, is involved in a spectrum of cellular processes including inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer initiation/progression. Based on this background, we hypothesised that in MF circulating CRT might reflect the inflammatory process. In the present study we show that circulating CRT is increased in MF patients compared to healthy controls. Also, in MF, CRT levels highly correlate with bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma levels. In turn, higher IL-6 levels also correlated with disease severity in terms of increased spleen size, bone marrow fibrosis, number of circulating CD34(+) cells, and lower hemoglobin values. These results demonstrate that the circulating CRT takes part in the inflammatory network of MF and correlates with aggressiveness of the disease.","['Sollazzo, Daria', 'Forte, Dorian', 'Polverelli, Nicola', 'Perricone, Margherita', 'Romano, Marco', 'Luatti, Simona', 'Vianelli, Nicola', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Palandri, Francesca', 'Catani, Lucia']","['Sollazzo D', 'Forte D', 'Polverelli N', 'Perricone M', 'Romano M', 'Luatti S', 'Vianelli N', 'Cavo M', 'Palandri F', 'Catani L']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

Immune checkpoint pathways regulate GvL and GvHD activities, but blocking antibodies or genetic inactivation of these pathways can cause lethal GVHD. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an immunosuppressive neuropeptide that regulates coinhibitory pathways; its role in allo-BMT has not been studied. We found VIP transiently expressed in donor NK, NK-T, dendritic cells, and T cells after allo transplant, as well as host leukocytes. A peptide antagonist of VIP signaling (VIPhyb) increased T-cell proliferation in vitro and reduced IL10 expression in donor T cells. Treatment of allo-BMT recipients with VIPhyb, or transplanting donor grafts lacking VIP (VIP-KO), activated donor T-cells in lymphoid organs, reduced T-cell homing to GvHD target organs, and enhanced GvL without increasing GvHD in multiple allo-BMT models. Genetic or ex vivo depletion of donor NK cells or CD8(+) T cells from allografts abrogated the VIPhyb-enhanced GvL activity. VIPhyb treatment led to downregulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on donor immune cells, increased effector molecule expression, and expanded oligoclonal CD8(+) T cells that protected secondary allo transplant recipients from leukemia. Blocking VIP signaling thus represents a novel pharmacologic approach to separate GvL from GvHD and enhance adaptive T-cell responses to leukemia-associated antigens in allo-BMT.

However, responses are not durable and resistance develops within months. In this study, we outline a two-step model of resistance whereby extrinsic microenvironmental proteins FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, providing time for subsequent accumulation of ligand-independent resistance mechanisms. FL directly attenuated AC220 inhibition of FLT3, consistent with previous reports. Conversely, FGF2 promoted resistance through activation of FGFR1 and downstream MAPK effectors; these resistant cells responded synergistically to combinatorial inhibition of FGFR1 and FLT3. Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance via reactivation of FLT3 and RAS/MAPK signaling. FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations. Overall, these results support a strategy of early combination therapy to target early survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular FGF2, to improve the depth of response in FLT3-ITD AML.

Conflicting reports in the literature and a paucity of studies from the developing world prompted us to study bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood ALL survivors. METHODS: BMD lumbar spine (LS) and whole body (WB) were evaluated, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in 65 pediatric ALL survivors who had been off-therapy for at least 2 years. The control group constituted of 50 age- and sex-matched healthy siblings. Kernel density plots were used to compare BMD among cases and controls. The disease-, treatment-, hormone- and lifestyle-related factors likely to modulate BMD were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t-test. RESULTS: At a median of 4.3 years (range, 2-14.8 years) since cessation of therapy, height-adjusted (HA) mean BMD Z-scores of LS (-0.67 +/- 1.11, -0.607 +/- 1.05, P = 0.759) and WB (-0.842 +/- 0.92, -0.513 +/- 0.97, P = 0.627) were comparable among the cases and controls. Disease, treatment (chemotherapy, cranial radiotherapy) and endocrine factors did not predict low BMD. However, survivors with calcium intake <800 mg/day (WB, P = 0.018) and hypovitaminosis D (</=25 nmol/L) had lower BMD values (HA-WB, P = 0.046) than the controls. A significant proportion of survivors were overweight or obese and had higher BMD Z-scores (HA-LS, P = 0.003; HA-WB, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: BMD Z-scores were similar among ALL survivors and controls. It was reassuring that there was no detrimental impact of the disease or its treatment on BMD. Future studies are required to determine the best possible ways to target the modifiable risk factors (diet, vitamin D) to optimize bone health.","['Jain, Silky', 'Jain, Sandeep', 'Kapoor, Gauri', 'Virmani, Anju', 'Bajpai, Ram']","['Jain S', 'Jain S', 'Kapoor G', 'Virmani A', 'Bajpai R']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Sector-5, Rohini, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Max Superspeciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Nayati Healthcare and Research Centre, Gurgaon, Haryana, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160926,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/28 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26271 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Apr;64(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26271.

Its effect depends on sebocyte apoptosis, which results from isotretinoin-induced expression of the apoptotic protein tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. This review proposes that the pharmacological mode of action of isotretinoin in the treatment of severe acne, acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and neuroblastoma results from apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis may be the underlying and unifying mechanism of the adverse effects of isotretinoin on neural crest cells (teratogenicity), hippocampal neurones (depression), epidermal keratinocytes and mucosa cells (mucocutaneous side-effects), hair follicle cells (telogen effluvium), intestinal epithelial cells (inflammatory bowel disease), skeletal muscle cells (myalgia and release of creatine kinase), and hepatocytes (release of transaminases and very low-density lipoproteins). Genetic variants of components of the apoptotic signalling cascade, such as RARA polymorphisms, might explain variations in the magnitude of isotretinoin-induced apoptotic signalling and apparently identify subgroups of patients who experience either stronger adverse effects with isotretinoin therapy or resistance to treatment.","['Melnik, Bodo C']",['Melnik BC'],"['Department of Dermatology, Environmental Medicine and Health Theory, University of Osnabruck, DE-49076 Osnabruck, Germany.

It has an essential role in B-cell development and function. Activation of BTK has been associated with the pathogenesis of many types of lymphomas and leukemia, and involved in non-life threatening autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: In this study, exhaustive pharmacophore modeling was combined with QSAR analyses to examine the structural requirements for anti-BTK activities. METHOD: Genetic function algorithm (GFA) was coupled with multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis to select the best combinations of physicochemical descriptors and pharmacophoric hypothesis capable of generating predictive and self-consistent QSAR models. The optimum pharmacophores were decorated with exclusion volumes to improve their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve properties. The best predictive QSAR model and its corresponding pharmacophore models were validated by discovering of novel promising BTK inhibitors retrieved from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database. RESULTS: Several potent hits exhibited anti-proliferative activities on U-937 cell-line in low micromolar IC50, and one active compound showed nontoxic activities on normal fibroblast cell line. CONCLUSION: Our efforts culminated in the identification of potent BTK ligands having desired inhibitory activities and structurally distinct from known active reference compounds (i.e., training compounds) and represent new chemotypes.","['Mera, Wafa A', 'Alzihlif, Malek', 'Taha, Mutasem O', 'Khanfar, Mohammad A']","['Mera WA', 'Alzihlif M', 'Taha MO', 'Khanfar MA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Amman 11942,Jordan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Amman 11942,Jordan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Ligands', 'Linear Models', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'ROC Curve']",,,2016/09/28 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-78565 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520616666160926114416 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2017;17(2):265-275. doi: 10.2174/1871520616666160926114416.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New agents are necessary to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and to reduce their undesirable long-term toxicities. The identification of driving molecular alterations of leukemogenesis in subsets of patients will allow the incorporation of new-targeted therapies. Areas covered: In this article the authors present a detailed review of the most recent advances in targeted therapies for pediatric leukemias. A comprehensive description of the biological background, adult data and early clinical trials in pediatrics is provided. Expert opinion: Clinical trials are the way to evaluate new agents in pediatric cancer. The development of new drugs in pediatric leukemia must be preceded by a solid biological rationale. Agents in development exploit all possible vulnerabilities of leukemic cells. Drugs targeting cell surface antigens, intracellular signaling pathways and cell cycle inhibitors or epigenetic regulators are most prominent. Major advances have occurred thanks to new developments in engineering leading to optimized molecules such as anti-CD19 bi-specific T-cell engagers (e.g. blinatumomab) and antibody-drug conjugates. The integration of new-targeted therapies in pediatric chemotherapy-based regimens will lead to improved outcomes.","['Bautista, Francisco', 'Van der Lugt, Jasper', 'Kearns, Pamela R', 'Mussai, Francis J', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Moreno, Lucas']","['Bautista F', 'Van der Lugt J', 'Kearns PR', 'Mussai FJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Moreno L']","['a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation , Hospital Nino Jesus , Madrid , Spain.', ""b Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , Erasmus-MC Sophia Children's Hospital , Rotterdam , The Netherlands."", 'c Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, School of Cancer Sciences , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.', 'c Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, School of Cancer Sciences , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.', ""b Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , Erasmus-MC Sophia Children's Hospital , Rotterdam , The Netherlands."", 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation , Hospital Nino Jesus , Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160927,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/28 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1237939 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Nov;11(11):1111-1122. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1237939.

The disease starts in the bone marrow and then expands to peripheral areas, which is typical of M5 leukemogenesis, where high leukemic burden in blood is coincident with symptoms/mortality. The leukemic cells in the mice had myeloid morphology, phenotypes, and genotypes (including the internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 gene [FLT3-ITD]) similar to those of the original patient. Autocrine mechanisms of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-3 likely support AM7577 growth in mice. Treatment with FLT3 TKI (AC220) caused complete remission in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone, along with relief of symptoms and extended life, hinting that FLT3-ITD may be a key leukemogenic driver maintaining the disease. Interestingly, withdrawal of AC220 (high dose) did not result in relapse of disease, suggesting cure. These results, however, are in contrast to cytarabine (AraC) induction treatment: First, although AraC significantly suppresses the diseases in blood, and to a lesser degree in bone marrow and spleen, the suppression is temporary and does not prevent eventual onset of disease/death. Second, the withdrawal of AraC always resulted in rapid relapse in peripheral blood and eventually death. Our observation in this patient-derived model may provide useful information for clinical applications of the two drugs.","['An, Xiaoyu', 'Liu, Jinping', 'Wang, Na', 'Wang, Di', 'Huang, Liang', 'Zhang, Likun', 'Cai, Jie', 'Wery, Jean-Pierre', 'Zhou, Demin', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Li, Qi-Xiang']","['An X', 'Liu J', 'Wang N', 'Wang D', 'Huang L', 'Zhang L', 'Cai J', 'Wery JP', 'Zhou D', 'Zhou J', 'Li QX']","['Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Crown Bioscience, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA; State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Duplication', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(16)30614-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2016.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2017 Jan;45:36-44.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2016.09.004.

Because preliminary data indicate enrichment of NFKBIE aberrations in other lymphoid malignancies, we screened a large patient cohort (n = 1460) diagnosed with different lymphoid neoplasms. While NFKBIE deletions were infrequent in follicular lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<2%), slightly higher frequencies were seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and primary central nervous system lymphoma (3% to 4%). In contrast, a remarkably high frequency of NFKBIE aberrations (46/203 cases [22.7%]) was observed in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (3/11 cases [27.3%]). NFKBIE-deleted PMBL patients were more often therapy refractory (P = .022) and displayed inferior outcome compared with wild-type patients (5-year survival, 59% vs 78%; P = .034); however, they appeared to benefit from radiotherapy (P =022) and rituximab-containing regimens (P = .074). NFKBIE aberrations remained an independent factor in multivariate analysis (P = .003) and when restricting the analysis to immunochemotherapy-treated patients (P = .008). Whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling verified the importance of NF-kappaB deregulation in PMBL. In summary, we identify NFKBIE aberrations as a common genetic event across B-cell malignancies and highlight NFKBIE deletions as a novel poor-prognostic marker in PMBL.","['Mansouri, Larry',

However, sustained responses, although reported, are uncommon, suggesting that other pathways can substitute for Notch in T-ALL. To address this possibility, we first generated Kras(G12D) transgenic mice with T-cell-specific expression of the pan-Notch inhibitor, dominant-negative Mastermind (DNMAML). These mice developed leukemia, but instead of accessing alternative oncogenic pathways, the tumor cells acquired Notch1 mutations and subsequently deleted DNMAML, reinforcing the notion that activated Notch1 is particularly transforming within the context of T-cell progenitors. We next took a candidate approach to identify oncogenic pathways downstream of Notch, focusing on Myc and Akt, which are Notch targets in T-cell progenitors. Kras(G12D) mice transduced with Myc developed T-ALLs that were GSI-insensitive and lacked Notch1 mutations. In contrast, Kras(G12D) mice transduced with myristoylated AKT developed GSI-sensitive T-ALLs that acquired Notch1 mutations. Thus, Myc can substitute for Notch1 in leukemogenesis, whereas Akt cannot. These findings in primary tumors extend recent work using human T-ALL cell lines and xenografts and suggest that the Notch/Myc signaling axis is of predominant importance in understanding both the selective pressure for Notch mutations in T-ALL and response and resistance of T-ALL to Notch pathway inhibitors.","['Chiang, Mark Y', 'Wang, Qing', 'Gormley, Anna C', 'Stein, Sarah J', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Chiang MY', 'Wang Q', 'Gormley AC', 'Stein SJ', 'Xu L', 'Shestova O', 'Aster JC', 'Pear WS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, School of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, School of Medicine and.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160926,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",PMC5095757,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34009-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-692855 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Nov 3;128(18):2229-2240. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-692855.

CD16, the FcgammaRIIIA, is essential for ADCC by NK cells, and is also expressed by a subset of human blood monocytes. We found that human CD16- expressing monocytes have a broad spectrum of ADCC capacities and can kill cancer cell lines, primary leukemic cells and hepatitis B virus-infected cells in the presence of specific antibodies. Engagement of CD16 on monocytes by antibody bound to target cells activated beta2-integrins and induced TNFalpha secretion. In turn, this induced TNFR expression on the target cells, making them susceptible to TNFalpha-mediated cell death. Treatment with TLR agonists, DAMPs or cytokines, such as IFNgamma, further enhanced ADCC. Monocytes lacking CD16 did not exert ADCC but acquired this property after CD16 expression was induced by either cytokine stimulation or transient transfection. Notably, CD16+ monocytes from patients with leukemia also exerted potent ADCC. Hence, CD16+ monocytes are important effectors of ADCC, suggesting further developments of this property in the context of cellular therapies for cancer and infectious diseases.","['Yeap, Wei Hseun', 'Wong, Kok Loon', 'Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Teo, Esmeralda Chi Yuan', 'Quek, Jeffrey Kim Siang', 'Yong, Hao Xiang', 'Diong, Colin Phipps', 'Bertoletti, Antonio', 'Linn, Yeh Ching', 'Wong, Siew Cheng']","['Yeap WH', 'Wong KL', 'Shimasaki N', 'Teo EC', 'Quek JK', 'Yong HX', 'Diong CP', 'Bertoletti A', 'Linn YC', 'Wong SC']","['Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), 8A Biomedical Grove, #04-06, Immunos, Singapore 138648, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), 8A Biomedical Grove, #04-06, Immunos, Singapore 138648, Singapore.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, 14 Medical Drive Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608, Singapore.', 'Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Brenner Centre for Molecular Medicine, 30 Medical Drive, Singapore 117609, Singapore.', 'Duke-NUS Medical School, 8 College Road, Singapore 169857, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), 8A Biomedical Grove, #04-06, Immunos, Singapore 138648, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160927,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5037471,,2016/09/28 06:00,2016/09/28 06:01,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:01 [medline]']","['srep34310 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34310 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 27;6:34310. doi: 10.1038/srep34310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 07;7:46202.

Here, we showed that enforced expression of NPM1 mutation type A (NPM1-mA) inhibits myeloid differentiation of leukemia cells, whereas knockdown of NPM1-mA has the opposite effect. Our analyses of normal karyotype AML samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset revealed that miR-10b is commonly overexpressed in NPM1-mutated AMLs. We also found high expression of miR-10b in primary NPM1-mutated AML blasts and NPM1-mA positive OCI-AML3 cells. In addition, NPM1-mA knockdown enhanced myeloid differentiation, while induced expression of miR-10b reversed this effect. Finally, we showed that KLF4 is downregulated in NPM1-mutated AMLs. These results demonstrated that miR-10b exerts its effects by repressing the translation of KLF4 and that NPM1-mA inhibits myeloid differentiation through the miR-10b/KLF4 axis. This sheds new light on the effect of NPM1 mutations' on leukemogenesis.","['Zou, Qin', 'Tan, Shi', 'Yang, Zailin', 'Wang, Juan', 'Xian, Jingrong', 'Zhang, Shuaishuai', 'Jin, Hongjun', 'Yang, Liyuan', 'Wang, Lu', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Zou Q', 'Tan S', 'Yang Z', 'Wang J', 'Xian J', 'Zhang S', 'Jin H', 'Yang L', 'Wang L', 'Zhang L']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children, Chongqing, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Children's Medical Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",PMC5342094,,2016/09/28 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/09/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['12216 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12216 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 1;7(44):71477-71490. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12216.,,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['differentiation', 'leukemia', 'microRNA', 'mutation', 'nucleophosmin 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTK was initially identified by positional cloning of the gene causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and independently in a search for new kinases. Given the phenotype of affected patients, namely lack of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells with the ensuing inability to mount humoral immune responses, BTK inhibitors were anticipated to have beneficial effects on antibody-mediated pathologies, such as autoimmunity. In contrast to, for example, the SRC-family of cytoplasmic kinases, there was no obvious way in which structural alterations would yield constitutively active forms of BTK, and such mutations were also not found in leukemias or lymphomas. In 2007, the first efficient inhibitor, ibrutinib, was reported and soon became approved both in the United States and in Europe for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Over the past few years, additional inhibitors have been developed, with acalabrutinib being more selective, and recently demonstrating fewer clinical adverse effects. The antitumor mechanism is also not related to mutations in BTK. Instead tumor residency in lymphoid organs is inhibited, making these drugs highly versatile. BTK is one of the only 10 human kinases that carry a cysteine in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cleft. As this allows for covalent, irreversible inhibitor binding, it provides these compounds with a highly advantageous character. This quality may be crucial and bodes well for the future of BTK-modifying medicines, which have been estimated to reach annual multi-billion dollar sales in the future.","['Smith, C I E']",['Smith CI'],"['Clinical Research Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160926,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5395699,,2016/09/27 06:00,2017/04/20 06:00,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016343 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.343 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Apr;36(15):2045-2053. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.343.

LSC in CD34+ and more mature CD34- AML have heterogeneous immunophenotypes overlapping with normal stem/progenitor cells (SPC) but may be differentiated by functional markers. We therefore investigated the oxidative/reactive oxygen species (ROS) profile, its relationship with cell-cycle/BCL2 for normal SPC, and whether altered in AML and myelodysplasia (MDS). In control BM (n = 24), ROS levels were highest in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and CD34- myeloid precursors but megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors had equivalent levels to CD34+CD38low immature-SPC although they were ki67high. BCL2 upregulation was specific to GMPs. This profile was also observed for CD34+SPC in MDS-without-excess-blasts (MDS-noEB, n = 12). Erythroid CD34- precursors were, however, abnormally ROS-high in MDS-noEB, potentially linking oxidative stress to cell loss. In pre-treatment AML (n = 93) and MDS-with-excess-blasts (MDS-RAEB) (n = 14), immunophenotypic mature-SPC had similar ROS levels to co-existing immature-SPC. However ROS levels varied between AMLs; Flt3ITD+/NPM1wild-type CD34+SPC had higher ROS than NPM1mutated CD34+ or CD34- SPC. An aberrant ki67lowBCL2high immunophenotype was observed in CD34+AML (most prominent in Flt3ITD AMLs) but also in CD34- AMLs and MDS-RAEB, suggesting a shared redox/pro-survival adaptation. Some patients had BCL2 overexpression in CD34+ ROS-high as well as ROS-low fractions which may be indicative of poor early response to standard chemotherapy. Thus normal SPC subsets have distinct ROS, cell-cycle, BCL2 profiles that in AML /MDS-RAEB are decoupled from maturation. The combined profile of these functional properties in AML subpopulations may be relevant to differential treatment resistance.","['Khan, Naeem', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Knapper, Steve', 'Steadman, Lora', 'Qureshi, Ushna', 'Rector, Jerrald L', 'Bradbury, Charlotte', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Grimwade, David', 'Hole, Paul S', 'Freeman, Sylvie D']","['Khan N', 'Hills RK', 'Knapper S', 'Steadman L', 'Qureshi U', 'Rector JL', 'Bradbury C', 'Russell NH', 'Vyas P', 'Burnett AK', 'Grimwade D', 'Hole PS', 'Freeman SD']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, Guy's & St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160926,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,,PMC5036879,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/27 06:00,2016/09/27 06:01,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0163291 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-26712 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Sep 26;11(9):e0163291. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163291. eCollection 2016.,"['MC_UU_12009/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1433-8454'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available literature data indicate that leukemic cells may respond to the presence of pathogens through specific Toll-like receptors (TLR). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of in vitro PPV23 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, CD25, CD69, and CD95 on the surface of CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in CLL patients. METHODS: A total of 30 previously untreated patients with CLL, stage 0 according to the Rai classification, were included in the study. PBMCs obtained from each patient were cultured with and without PPV23 antigens. After 24-, 48-, and 72 h cultures, the viable cells underwent labeling with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, and were analyzed using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: Between 24 h and 72 h (p=0.002) stimulation with PPV23 and between 48 h and 72 h (p=0.034) stimulation with PPV23 the frequencies of CD3+TLR-2+ cells were diminished. Increase of the value of the percentage of CD19+CD69+ cells was observed after 24 h (p=0.003), 48 h (p=0.025) and 72 h (p=0.012) of stimulation with PPV23. Stimulation with PPV23 led to an increase of the percentage of CD19+CD95+ cells after 24 h (p=0.003), 48 h (p=0.015), and 72 h (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We found that both T and B cells respond to antigens of PPV23 by inducing TLR-dependent pathways, lymphocyte activation and CD95 expression.","['Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Hymos, Anna', 'Korona-Glowniak, Izabela', 'Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Stelmach-Goldys, Agnieszka', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Malm, Anna', 'Rolinski, Jacek']","['Grywalska E', 'Hymos A', 'Korona-Glowniak I', 'Pasiarski M', 'Stelmach-Goldys A', 'Gozdz S', 'Malm A', 'Rolinski J']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,,,,,2016/09/27 06:00,2016/09/27 06:00,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1219399 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1219399 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2016 Sep 19;70(0):959-967. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1219399.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The loss of TFF2 protein expression enhances gastric inflammation and occurs in gastric cancer. In this study, we examined the effect of TFF2 on gastric cancer cell lines in vitro and characterized the interaction between TFF2 and Sp3, including the mechanisms that mediate this interaction, using genomics and proteomics approaches, as well as genetics techniques, such as RNA interference and gene knockdown. Assays were performed to examine the role of TFF2 and Sp3 in cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. We found that TFF2 expression inhibited the proliferation and invasion capacity of gastric cancer cells, and induced apoptosis. TFF2 interacted with the Sp3 protein, as shown by immuno fl uorescence staining and immunoprecipitation with western blot analysis. Sp3 knockdown in gastric cancer cells antagonized TFF2 antitumor activity. Additionally, TFF2 upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bid, but downregulated the expression of NF-kappaB and the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Mcl1. By contrast, Sp3 knockdown significantly blocked TFF2 activity, affecting the expression of these proteins. The data from our study demonstrate that the antitumor activity of TFF2 is mediated by an interaction with the Sp3 protein in gastric cancer cells.

Drug-induced immunomodulation with a reduction of regulatory T cells might have contributed to the development of ITP in our case.","['Tokeji, Kayo', 'Sakaguchi, Sachi', 'Kurimoto, Tomoko', 'Fujimura, Junya', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki']","['Tokeji K', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Kurimoto T', 'Fujimura J', 'Shimizu T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,PMC5030408,,2016/09/27 06:00,2016/09/27 06:01,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/2897325 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2016;2016:2897325. doi: 10.1155/2016/2897325.

Anticancer therapy with nucleoside analog drugs such as cytarabine (Ara-C) frequently has limited efficacy due to drug resistance, inefficient uptake and accumulation of the drug inside cancer cells where it has to be transformed into the active triphosphate congener. The cationic nature of PPI dendrimers makes it possible to form complexes with nucleotide Ara-C triphosphate forms (Ara-CTP). The aim of this work was to test the concept of applying PPI glycodendrimers as drug delivery devices in order to facilitate the delivery of activated cytarabine to cancer cells to overcome metabolic limitations of the drug. The study has been carried out using 1301 and HL-60 leukemic cell lines as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results of cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays showed enhanced activity of Ara-C triphosphate form (Ara-CTP) complexed with PPI-m dendrimers in relation to free Ara-C and Ara-CTP against 1301 leukemic cells. Secondly, enhanced uptake and cytotoxicity of Ara-CTP-dendrimers complexes toward 1301 cells with blocked human equilibrative nucleoside transporter - hENT1 suggested that this combination might be a versatile candidate for chemotherapy against resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with lower expression of hENT1.","['Szulc, Aleksandra', 'Pulaski, Lukasz', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Voit, Brigitte', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz, Barbara']","['Szulc A', 'Pulaski L', 'Appelhans D', 'Voit B', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz B']","['Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 141/143 Pomorska St., 90-236 Lodz, Poland.

Methods Megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines (Dami, Meg-01 and HEL cells) were induced towards polyploidization by SP600125, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. The SP600125-inducing process was blocked by H-89, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor. The phenotype (CD41a, CD42a and CD42b) and DNA ploidy were detected by flow cytometry. The expression and phosphorylation of S6K1 and related proteins were detected by Western blotting. Results SP600125 induced polyploidization and increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in Dami, Meg-01 and HEL cells. However, the effect of SP600125 on polyploidization of the three cell lines was different, with the strongest effect on Dami cells and the weakest on Meg-01 cells. Moreover, SP600125 increased the phosphorylation of S6K1 Thr421/Ser424 and decreased the phosphorylation of Thr389 in Dami cells. However, it only increased the phosphorylation of Thr389 in HEL cells and had no effect on the phosphorylation of S6K1 in Meg-01 cells. Interestingly, H-89 only partially blocked the polyploidization of Dami cells, although it decreased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in all SP600125-induced three cell lines. Noticeably, H-89 decreased the phosphorylation of S6K1 Thr421/Ser424 and increased the phosphorylation of Thr389 in Dami cells. However, H-89 had no effect on the phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser424, although it increased the phosphorylation of Thr389 in Meg-01 and HEL cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that the three cell lines were at different levels of differentiation in megakaryocytic lineage, with the highest differentiation in Dami and the lowest in Meg-01 cells. Conclusion SP600125-induced polyploidization of megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines is dependent on the effect of SP600125 on phosphorylation of S6K1 in cell lines at the different differentiation stages.","['Wang, Lili', 'Yang, Jingang', 'Li, Changling', 'Xing, Sining', 'Yu, Ying', 'Liu, Shuo', 'Zhao, Song', 'Ma, Dongchu']","['Wang L', 'Yang J', 'Li C', 'Xing S', 'Yu Y', 'Liu S', 'Zhao S', 'Ma D']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Northern Hospital, Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang 110016, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: mdc580819@sina.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,IM,"['Anthracenes/*pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyploidy', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,2016/09/27 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Oct;32(10):1336-1341.,,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that circulating SP-D levels are associated with chemotherapy-induced mucositis and infectious morbidity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: In a prospective study, 43 children receiving treatment for ALL were monitored for mucosal toxicity from diagnosis through the induction phase of treatment. Serial blood draws were taken to determine the levels of SP-D, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein, and white blood cells. Data on fever, antibiotics, and bacteremia were collected. Baseline levels of circulating SP-D were compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: Baseline values of circulating SP-D were similar to levels in healthy controls (median: 829 ng/ml vs. 657 ng/ml, respectively, P > 0.05). After initiation of chemotherapy, a significant reduction in SP-D levels was observed at all time points: 704 ng/ml at day 8, 413 ng/ml at day 15, 395 ng/ml at day 22, and 520 ng/ml at day 29 (all, P < 0.05). No significant associations between SP-D values, the occurrence of mucosal toxicity, or infectious morbidity were observed. However, loss of circulating SP-D from days 8 to 15 was associated with more systemic inflammation, and lower SP-D values at day 15 were associated with elevated intestinal mucositis scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current study supports the hypothesis that the detrimental effect of chemotherapy on patients' immune functions includes decreased circulating levels of innate mucosal molecules such as SP-D, potentially aggravating mucosal and systemic inflammatory responses.","['Rathe, Mathias', 'Sorensen, Grith L', 'Wehner, Peder S', 'Holmskov, Uffe', 'Sangild, Per T', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Muller, Klaus', 'Husby, Steffen']","['Rathe M', 'Sorensen GL', 'Wehner PS', 'Holmskov U', 'Sangild PT', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Muller K', 'Husby S']","[""Department of pediatric hematology and oncology, Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."", 'OPEN, Odense Patient Data Explorative Network, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Cancer and Inflammation, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', ""Department of pediatric hematology and oncology, Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."", 'Department of Cancer and Inflammation, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Section of Comparative Pediatrics and Nutrition, Department of Clinical Veterinary and Animal Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The Institute of Inflammation Research, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.', ""Department of pediatric hematology and oncology, Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160926,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Male', 'Mucositis/blood/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Mucous Membrane/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pneumonia/blood/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D/*blood']",,,2016/09/27 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26253 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Mar;64(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26253.

RNA sequencing showed fusion of exon 7 of RUNX1 with an intergenic sequence of 6q25 close to the MIR1202 locus, something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. The RUNX1 fusion transcript encodes a truncated protein containing the Runt homology domain responsible for both heterodimerization with CBFB and DNA binding, but lacking the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PST) region which is the transcription activation domain at the C terminal end. Which genetic event (+4, FLT3-ITD, t(6;21)-RUNX1 truncation or other, undetected acquired changes) was more pathogenetically important in the present case of AML, remains unknown.

However, direct use of RVS or its extract as a herbal medicine has been limited due to the presence of urushiol, an allergenic toxin. In the present study, we prepared an extract of the allergenremoved RVS (aRVS) based on a traditional method and investigated its inhibitory effect on the growth of various types of human cancer cells, including lung (A549), breast (MCF-7) and prostate (DU-145) cancer cell lines. Notably, among the cell lines tested, treatment with the aRVS extract strongly inhibited proliferation of the A549 cells at a 0.5 mg/ml concentration for 24 h that was not cytotoxic to normal human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, aRVS extract treatment largely reduced the survival and induced apoptosis of the A549 cells. At the mechanistic levels, treatment with the aRVS extract led to the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins, the activation of caspase-9/-3 proteins, an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c levels, the upregulation of Bax protein, an increase in phosphorylated p53 protein but a decrease in phosphorylated S6 protein in the A549 cells. Importantly, treatment with z-VADfmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor attenuated aRVS extract-induced apoptosis in the A549 cells. These results demonstrate firstly that aRVS extract has growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects on A549 human lung cancer cells through modulation of the expression levels and/or activities of caspases, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, p53 and S6.","['Jang, Ik-Soon', 'Park, Jae-Woo', 'Jo, Eun-Bi', 'Cho, Chong-Kwan', 'Lee, Yeon-Weol', 'Yoo, Hwa-Seung', 'Park, Junsoo', 'Kim, Jihye', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl', 'Choi, Jong-Soon']","['Jang IS', 'Park JW', 'Jo EB', 'Cho CK', 'Lee YW', 'Yoo HS', 'Park J', 'Kim J', 'Jang BC', 'Choi JS']","['Division of Bioconvergence, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.', 'East-West Cancer Center, Daejeon University, Daejeon 302-120, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Bioconvergence, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.', 'East-West Cancer Center, Daejeon University, Daejeon 302-120, Republic of Korea.', 'East-West Cancer Center, Daejeon University, Daejeon 302-120, Republic of Korea.', 'East-West Cancer Center, Daejeon University, Daejeon 302-120, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 220-100, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Bioconvergence, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rhus/chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2016/10/26 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/09/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2016.5131 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Nov;36(5):3037-3043. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5131.

In the present study, we investigated whether the risk of IFI in AML patients receiving HSCT might be affected by the antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole administered during the induction/salvage chemotherapy treatment. Between August 2001 and April 2015, 130 patients with AML received itraconazole/fluconazole (group A) and 99 received posaconazole (group B) as antifungal prophylaxis after induction/salvage chemotherapy at 7 Italian centers and all patients received fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis after HSCT. The median duration of antifungal prophylaxis after induction/salvage chemotherapy was significantly longer for patients in group A than for those in group B (24 days versus 20 days, P = .019). The 1-year cumulative incidence of proven/probable IFI after HSCT was 14% and 4% in group A and group B, respectively (P = .012). Fungal-free survival and overall survival at 1 year after HSCT were 66% and 70% in group A, and 75% and 77% in group B (P = .139 and P = .302), respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis identified the use of alternative donors (matched unrelated donor: odds ratio [OR], 3.25; haploidentical/partially matched related donor: OR, 3.19), antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole/fluconazole (OR, 3.82), and reduced-intensity conditioning (OR, 4.92) as independent risk factors for the development of IFI after HSCT. In summary, the present study suggests that the protective effects of posaconazole during induction/salvage chemotherapy for AML patients may have long-lasting benefits and eventually contribute to reduce the risk of IFI when patients undergo allogeneic HSCT.","['Busca, Alessandro', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Audisio, Ernesta', 'Passera, Roberto', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Monaco, Federico', 'Mordini, Nicola', 'Vacca, Adriana', 'Delia, Mario', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Busca A', 'Candoni A', 'Audisio E', 'Passera R', 'Bruno B', 'Monaco F', 'Mordini N', 'Vacca A', 'Delia M', 'Aversa F', 'Pagano L']","[""Department of Oncology and Hematology, Stem Cell Transplant Center, AOU Citta' della Salute e della Scienza, Turin, Italy.

However, which donor source is optimal for children lacking an identical sibling remains unclear. To evaluate the clinical impact of donor source on allo-HSCT in childhood acute leukemia, we analyzed data from 577 children who underwent allo-HSCT after a myeloablative regimen during first or second complete remission from 2005 to 2012, using registry data of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, and we compared outcomes of 7/8 to 8/8 HLA allelic-matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT, n = 218) and 4/6 to 6/6 HLA allelic-matched unrelated cord blood transplantation (UR-CBT, n = 200) to those of HLA-identical related bone marrow transplantation (ID-BMT, n = 159). The median follow-up of survivors was 40.0 months. Three-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates for ID-BMT, UR-BMT, and UR-CBT were 74.8% and 69.0%, 75.0% and 69.6%, and 71.8% and 63.8%, respectively. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that OS and LFS for the 3 groups are comparable, although UR-CBT carries a greater risk of nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio, 2.20; P = .03, compared to ID-BMT) in the myeloablative setting for childhood high-risk acute leukemia.","['Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Watanabe, Nobuhiro', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Kato, Shunichi', 'Ogawa, Atsushi', 'Inagaki, Jiro', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Kato, Koji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Miyamura, Koichi']","['Sakaguchi H', 'Watanabe N', 'Matsumoto K', 'Yabe H', 'Kato S', 'Ogawa A', 'Inagaki J', 'Goto H', 'Koh K', 'Yoshida N', 'Kato K', 'Cho Y', 'Kosaka Y', 'Takahashi Y', 'Inoue M', 'Kato K', 'Atsuta Y', 'Miyamura K']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.

Furthermore, a novel target gene of miR-101 was identified. Here, we confirmed that miR-101 was significantly downregulated in the blood samples of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) compared with the healthy controls, as determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) analysis. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that miR-101 significantly repressed the proliferation and invasion, and induced potent apoptosis in Jurkat cells, as determined by CCK-8, flow cytometer and cell invasion assays. Luciferase assay confirmed that Notch1 was a target gene of miR-101, and western blotting showed that miR-101 suppressed the expression of Notch1 at the protein level. Moreover, functional restoration assays revealed that Notch1 mediates the effects of miR-101 on Jurkat cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. miR-101 enhanced the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to the chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin. Taken together, our results show for the first time that miR-101 acts as a tumor suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and it could enhance chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Furthermore, Notch1 was identified to be a novel target of miR-101. This study indicates that miR-101 may represent a potential therapeutic target for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia intervention.","['Qian, Lu', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Lei, Bo', 'He, Aili', 'Ye, Lianhong', 'Li, Xingzhou', 'Dong, Xin']","['Qian L', 'Zhang W', 'Lei B', 'He A', 'Ye L', 'Li X', 'Dong X']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital omicronf Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710005, P.R.

They are routinely generated from healthy donors and patients from multiple cell types at different developmental stages. However, reprogramming leukemias is an extremely inefficient process. Few studies generated iPSCs from primary chronic myeloid leukemias, but iPSC generation from acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemias (ALL) has not been achieved. We attempted to generate iPSCs from different subtypes of B-ALL to address the developmental impact of leukemic fusion genes. OKSM(L)-expressing mono/polycistronic-, retroviral/lentiviral/episomal-, and Sendai virus vector-based reprogramming strategies failed to render iPSCs in vitro and in vivo. Addition of transcriptomic-epigenetic reprogramming ""boosters"" also failed to generate iPSCs from B cell blasts and B-ALL lines, and when iPSCs emerged they lacked leukemic fusion genes, demonstrating non-leukemic myeloid origin. Conversely, MLL-AF4-overexpressing hematopoietic stem cells/B progenitors were successfully reprogrammed, indicating that B cell origin and leukemic fusion gene were not reprogramming barriers. Global transcriptome/DNA methylome profiling suggested a developmental/differentiation refractoriness of MLL-rearranged B-ALL to reprogramming into pluripotency.","['Munoz-Lopez, Alvaro', 'Romero-Moya, Damia', 'Prieto, Cristina', 'Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Agraz-Doblas, Antonio', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Palau, Anna', 'Carvajal-Vergara, Xonia', 'Giorgetti, Alessandra', 'Ford, Anthony', 'Lako, Majlinda', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Rodriguez-Perales, Sandra', 'Torres-Ruiz, Raul', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Nakanishi, Mahito', 'Cazzaniga, Gianni', 'Bardini, Michela', 'Cobo, Isabel', 'Bayon, Gustavo F', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Munoz-Lopez A', 'Romero-Moya D', 'Prieto C', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Agraz-Doblas A', 'Varela I', 'Buschbeck M', 'Palau A', 'Carvajal-Vergara X', 'Giorgetti A', 'Ford A', 'Lako M', 'Granada I', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Stam RW', 'Fuster JL', 'Fraga MF', 'Nakanishi M', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Bardini M', 'Cobo I', 'Bayon GF', 'Fernandez AF', 'Bueno C', 'Menendez P']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Casanova 143, 08036 Barcelona, Spain;

Because of a lack of specific immunohistochemical markers, MZL is mainly diagnosed based on the cytological appearance and growth pattern of the tumor. Marginal zone B cells were recently shown to selectively express immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 1 (IRTA1), but the antibody used in that study is not commercially available. We therefore investigated the IRTA1 expression in nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues and 261 malignant lymphomas, examining the ability of a commercially available antibody to accurately diagnose MZL. Among 37 MZLs, 23 of 25 extranodal MZLs of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas), 3 of 6 splenic MZLs and 3 of 6 nodal MZLs were positive for IRTA1. Among the 98 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 33 were positive for IRTA1, including 1 of 38 follicular lymphomas, and all precursor B-lymphoblastic (2/2) and T-lymphoblastic (7/7) leukemia/lymphomas. Other mature B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, and Hodgkin lymphoma were negative for IRTA1. In MALT lymphoma, positive cells were detected mainly in intraepithelial and subepithelial marginal zone B cells. In 1 case of grade 3 follicular lymphoma, IRTA1 was also expressed in the area of large cell transformation. When tumors were classified as germinal center B cell-like (GCB) or non-GCB using the algorithm of Hans, positive expression of IRTA1 was correlated significantly with non-GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P < .05). These results demonstrated the ability of the commercially available IRTA1 antibody to distinguish MALT lymphoma from other low-grade B-cell lymphomas.","['Ikeda, Jun-Ichiro', 'Kohara, Masaharu', 'Tsuruta, Yoko', 'Nojima, Satoshi', 'Tahara, Shinichiro', 'Ohshima, Kenji', 'Kurashige, Masako', 'Wada, Naoki', 'Morii, Eiichi']","['Ikeda JI', 'Kohara M', 'Tsuruta Y', 'Nojima S', 'Tahara S', 'Ohshima K', 'Kurashige M', 'Wada N', 'Morii E']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.

The designed molecules contained two biologically active scaffolds: one was an imatinib derivative that binds to BCL-ABL and the other was a methyl bestatin that binds to cellular IAP 1 (cIAP1). The hybrid molecules, SNIPER(ABL), were expected to recruit BCR-ABL to cIAP1 for removal by proteasomes.

Impaired activity of Ikaros is associated with the development of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms that regulate Ikaros' function as a tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular proliferation are not well understood. We demonstrated that Ikaros is a substrate for Casein Kinase II (CK2), an oncogenic kinase that is overexpressed in ALL. Phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 impairs Ikaros' DNA-binding ability, as well as Ikaros' ability to regulate gene expression and function as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. Targeting CK2 with specific inhibitors restores Ikaros' function as a transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor resulting in a therapeutic, anti-leukemia effect in a preclinical model of ALL. Here, we review the genes and pathways that are regulated by Ikaros and the molecular mechanisms through which Ikaros and CK2 regulate cellular proliferation in leukemia.","['Gowda, Chandrika', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Kapadia, Malika', 'Payne, Jonathon L', 'Hu, Tommy', 'Ding, Yali', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Gowda C', 'Song C', 'Kapadia M', 'Payne JL', 'Hu T', 'Ding Y', 'Dovat S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA; Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.

Work reviewed in this article has revealed the involvement of NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived ROS downstream of oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases in both processes, and the related pathways have been partially identified. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), an important oncoprotein in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias, causes activation of AKT and, subsequently, stabilization of p22(phox), a regulatory subunit for NOX1-4. This process is linked to ROS formation and DNA damage. Moreover, FLT3-ITD signaling through STAT5 enhances expression of NOX4, ROS formation, and inactivation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1/PTPRJ, a negative regulator of FLT3 signaling, by reversible oxidation of its catalytic cysteine residue. Genetic inactivation of NOX4 restores DEP-1 activity and attenuates cell transformation by FLT3-ITD in vitro and in vivo. Future work is required to further explore these mechanisms and their causal involvement in leukemic cell transformation, which may result in the identification of novel candidate targets for therapy.","['Jayavelu, Ashok Kumar', 'Moloney, Jennifer N', 'Bohmer, Frank-D', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Jayavelu AK', 'Moloney JN', 'Bohmer FD', 'Cotter TG']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Bioscience Research Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.

Here we found Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), a highly conserved cellular protein belonging to SF1 helicase family, played critical roles in EV71 infection. Silencing cellular MOV10 could restrict EV71 replication, while over-expressing MOV10 resulted in increased viral replication at low dosage and repressed viral replication at high dosage. Further investigation showed that MOV10 exhibited dual functions in EV71 regulation, its C-terminus positively regulated viral replication by binding to EV71 cloverleaf-like structure and the internal ribosome entry site while the N-terminus showed a potential antiviral activity when individually overexpressed. In addition, RNA-dependent interaction between MOV10 and HuR as well as the co-localization of MOV10 and processing bodies were also observed post infection.

Massive parallel RNA sequencing of highly purified mesenchymal cells in the SDS mouse model and a range of human pre-leukemic syndromes identified p53-S100A8/9-TLR inflammatory signaling as a common driving mechanism of genotoxic stress. Transcriptional activation of this signaling axis in the mesenchymal niche predicted leukemic evolution and progression-free survival in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the principal leukemia predisposition syndrome.

We determined the clinical significance of PE incidence using patient data derived from the D-First clinical study. In the present study, chest radiography and quantification of specific lymphocyte subsets were performed routinely after initiation of dasatinib treatment. Among 52 patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, 17 (33%) developed PE within 18 months after initial dasatinib administration, but all cases were moderate (Grade 1, 10 patients; Grade 2, 7 patients). CD56+ lymphocyte counts at 1 month correlated significantly with the incidence of PE, whereas lymphocytosis did not. The major molecular response (MMR) rate at 3 months (although not at later times) was significantly higher in PE-positive patients than PE-negative patients (59% versus 24%, respectively; P=0.013).

Therefore, new strategies need to be explored to extend the efficacy of ATRA-based therapy to non-APL AML patients. In the present study, staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) pan-inhibitor, exhibited synergism with ATRA to promote granulocytic differentiation in poorly ATRA-sensitive U937 cells but not in ATRA unresponsive K562 and Kasumi cells. Staurosporine or the combined treatment did not affect PKC activity in U937 cells. Moreover, other selective PKC inhibitors, UCN-01, Go6976 or rottlerin failed to enhance ATRAinduced granulocytic differentiation in U937 cells. Therefore, staurosporine-enhanced ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in U937 cells may be independent of PKC. Staurosporine activated mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK). Meanwhile, staurosporine also enhanced ATRA-promoted upregulation of the protein level of CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and C/EBPepsilon in U937 cells. Furthermore, blockade of MEK activation suppressed staurosporineenhanced differentiation as well as the elevated protein level of C/EBPs. Taken together, we concluded that staurosporine enhanced ATRAinduced granulocytic differentiation in U937 cells via MEK/ERK-mediated modulation of the protein level of C/EBPs.","['Shi, Lei', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Sheng, Yan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Ding, Ming', 'Cai, Xun']","['Shi L', 'Weng XQ', 'Sheng Y', 'Wu J', 'Ding M', 'Cai X']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

While they are microscopically indistinguishable from T cells and share many of the same effector functions, their mechanisms of target recognition are completely distinct from yet complimentary to T cells. In this review we provide a basic understanding of NK cell biology and HLA recognition as compared and contrasted to T cells using a metaphor of border patrol and passports.

AIM: In this retrospective study, we analysed the incidence of cSCC in patients seen at a tertiary hospital in New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the clinical history and histology data of CLL patients (n = 371) who presented to the Haematology Department, Christchurch Hospital, NZ during the period 1996-2015. Baseline characteristics, incidence of second cancers, treatment details and overall survival were analysed. RESULTS: During follow-up (median = 11.8 years), 221 second cancers were recorded in 88 patients. Of these cancers, 185 were cSCC, removed from 61 patients. In 56% of these patients, >1 cSCC was removed, and the majority of cSCC occurred following the treatment for CLL. The cumulative incidence of a first cSCC was 11% at 5 years, whereas the cumulative incidence of a subsequent cSCC was 88% at 5 years. The incidence of cSCC in male patients was threefold higher than that reported for the general NZ population. CONCLUSION: NZ CLL patients have a high incidence of cSCC relative to the levels observed in the general population, which are themselves among the highest in the world. The careful monitoring of CLL patients is warranted, particularly those who have a progressive disease or have had a first cSCC removed.","['Hock, B D', 'McIntosh, N D', 'McKenzie, J L', 'Pearson, J F', 'Simcock, J W', 'MacPherson, S A']","['Hock BD', 'McIntosh ND', 'McKenzie JL', 'Pearson JF', 'Simcock JW', 'MacPherson SA']","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology Unit, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Haematology Department, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy']",,,2016/09/25 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2016/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imj.13261 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2016 Dec;46(12):1414-1421. doi: 10.1111/imj.13261.,,,,,['(c) 2016 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'incidence', 'skin cancer', 'squamous cell carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that, despite the significantly different disease courses typical of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, there would be identifiable risk factors for premature CVAD removal. METHODS: We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics and procedure records for all patients admitted with a leukemia diagnosis at our institution from May 2009 to July 2014. RESULTS: Our observed perioperative complication rate was 6%; over 70% of lines had at least one long-term complication (thrombosis, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or unexplained line malfunction). Obesity (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% CI, 1.62-29.43), preoperative dosage of packed red blood cells (in mL/kg; OR, 3.13; 1.07-9.21), bloodstream infection (OR, 5.75; 1.69-19.56) were associated with increased risk of premature catheter removal; unexplained malfunction was associated with a lower risk (OR, 0.28; 0.09-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, the preoperative dosage of packed red blood cells, the presence of a bloodstream infection, and unexplained line malfunction are significant predictors of premature CVAD removal in a pediatric leukemia population.","['Fu, Aurelia B', 'Hodgman, Erica I', 'Burkhalter, Lorraine S', 'Renkes, Rachel', 'Slone, Tamra', 'Alder, Adam C']","['Fu AB', 'Hodgman EI', 'Burkhalter LS', 'Renkes R', 'Slone T', 'Alder AC']","[""Division of Pediatric Surgery, Children's Health, Dallas, Texas."", 'Department of General Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', ""Division of Pediatric Surgery, Children's Health, Dallas, Texas."", ""Division of Pediatric Surgery, Children's Health, Dallas, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', ""Division of Pediatric Surgery, Children's Health, Dallas, Texas; Department of Pediatric Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.

However, 15-20% of the t(12;21)-positive cases are associated with high-risk disease due to for example slow early responses to therapy. It is well-known that development of overt leukemia in t(12;21)-positive ALL requires secondary chromosomal aberrations although the full spectrum of these cytogenetic alterations is yet unsettled, and also, how they may be associated with disease outcome. This report describes the case of an adolescent male with t(12;21)-positive ALL who displayed a G-banded karyotype initially interpreted as del(1)(p22p13) and del(15)(q15). The patient was treated according to NOPHO standard risk protocol at diagnosis, but had minimal residual disease (MRD) at 6,4% on day 29 as determined by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Because of MRD level>0.1% he was then assigned as a high risk patient and received intensified chemotherapy accordingly. Further molecular cytogenetic studies and oligo-based aCGH (oaCGH) analysis characterized the acquired complex structural rearrangements on chromosomes 1 and 15, which can be described as der(1)del(1)(p13.1p31.1)t(1;15)(q42;q15) with concurrent deletions at 1q31.2-q31.3, 1q42.12-q43, and 15q15.1-q15.3. The unbalanced complex rearrangements have not been described previously. Extended locus-specific FISH analyses showed that the three deletions were on the same chromosome 1 homologue that was involved in the t(1;15), and that the deletion on chromosome 15 also was on the same chromosome 15 homologue as involved in the t(1;15). Together these findings show the great importance of the combined usage of molecular cytogenetic analyses and oaCGH analysis to enhance characterization of apparently simple G-banded karyotypes, and to provide a more complete spectrum of secondary chromosomal aberrations in high risk t(12;21)-positive BCP-ALLs.","['Kjeldsen, Eigil']",['Kjeldsen E'],"['Hemodiagnostic Laboratory, Cancer Cytogenetics Section, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

PURPOSE: To better understand the interaction of rhBMP-2 and peripheral nerves with the intent of making procedures safer. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Using a mouse model to examine the direct effect of diluted rhBMP-2 (Infuse) on murine sciatic nerves. METHODS: Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Balb/c mouse sciatic nerves were surgically exposed and 60 ng (in 10 microL) of rhBMP-2 was applied to the nerve. In separate experiments, the sciatic nerves were subjected to mechanical compression using forceps (and not exposed to rhBMP-2). The third group of mice received direct injection of the same amount of rhBMP-2, or sterile saline as a control, into the hamstring area of the posterior thigh without surgery. Mouse limbs with intact sciatic nerve were collected at 24, 48, or 72 hours after treatment for histology processing. A separate set of identically treated sciatic nerves were retrieved from mice at the same time points and cells were isolated by collagenase and trypsin digestion. The isolated cells were cultured in a stem cell medium containing 20% knockout serum and human leukemia inhibitory factor. Immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent cell stains against KLF4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 were performed on the mouse tissue sections and cell culture slides. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify the mRNA expression profiles of the stem cell marker genes in cultured cells. RESULTS: Profound morphological changes of the mouse sciatic nerves were noted after exposure to rhBMP-2, with a rapid and robust cell proliferation within the nerves followed by migration of these cells into surrounding tissue. Immunohistochemical stain revealed strong nuclear stains of KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and c-Myc on the overwhelming majority of these proliferating cells in the nerve. Intramuscular injections of rhBMP-2 or willful physical compression of the nerves showed similar cell proliferation effects as the direct application of Infuse to the sciatic nerve. The cells in stem cell culture medium grew steadily without feeder cells and appeared fairly uniform. They were adherent to substrate and were motile. Double fluorescent staining on the cells indicated colocalizationof all pairs of the four stem cell markers in the cell nuclei. Real-time PCR confirmed the strong mRNA expressions of KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and c-Myc in these isolated cells. CONCLUSION: Exposure to BMP-2 causes a marked proliferation of previously quiescent cells within peripheral nerves. These cells simultaneously express KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and c-Myc, the transcription factors that confer embryonic pluripotency. Work described in the companion paper reveals some of the differentiation capacity of the cells and their likely clinical significance. In addition, the effects of direct exposure of nerves to rhBMP-2 as described here should clearly illuminate the mechanism of BMP-2-related nerve complications. We would suggest that the use of this agent in proximity to known neural structures should only be done with extreme caution.","['Heggeness, Michael H', 'Strong, Nora', 'Wooley, Paul H', 'Yang, Shang-You']","['Heggeness MH', 'Strong N', 'Wooley PH', 'Yang SY']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Wichita, Kansas, USA.

Natural killer (NK) cells are the first lymphocytes to recover after transplantation and are considered powerful effector cells in HSCT. We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of early NK cell recovery in T cell-replete transplant recipients. Immune reconstitution was studied in 298 adult patients undergoing HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome from 2005 to 2013. In multivariate analysis NK cell numbers on day 30 (NK30) > 150 cells/microL were independently associated with superior overall survival (hazard ratio, .79; 95% confidence interval, .66 to .95; P = .01). Cumulative incidence analyses showed that patients with NK30 > 150 cells/microL had significantly less transplant-related mortality (TRM), P = .01. Patients with NK30 > 150 cells/microL experienced significantly lower numbers of life-threatening bacterial infections as well as viral infections, including cytomegalovirus. No association was observed in relation to relapse. These results suggest an independent protective effect of high early NK cell reconstitution on TRM that translates into improved overall survival after T cell-replete HSCT.","['Minculescu, Lia', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Friis, Lone Smidstrup', 'Petersen, Soeren Lykke', 'Schiodt, Ida', 'Ryder, Lars Peter', 'Andersen, Niels Smedegaard', 'Sengeloev, Henrik']","['Minculescu L', 'Marquart HV', 'Friis LS', 'Petersen SL', 'Schiodt I', 'Ryder LP', 'Andersen NS', 'Sengeloev H']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed by hematopoietic stem and precursor cells. Gain-of-function mutations of KIT cause systemic mastocytosis, which is characterized by abnormal accumulations of mast cells. We previously reported a mouse model of mastocytosis based on conditional expression of a constitutively active Kit protein. Half of these animals developed leukemic disease of B-lineage origin. Herein, we report that this condition bears striking similarities to human B-ALL. The immuno-phenotype of the leukemic cells was compatible with a pro-B-cell origin, as was the finding of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements in all cases, whereas light-chain loci were mostly not rearranged. Leukemogenesis was independent of pre-B-cell receptor expression. Primary leukemic cells and permanent cell lines derived from these were serially transplantable and rapidly killed the recipients. In a few animals, the leukemia was of T-cell origin with abnormal CD4/8 double-positive T-cell precursors dominating in the circulation. In summary, we report a novel ALL mouse model that may prove useful for in vivo drug testing and identification of novel oncogenic mutations and principles.","['Weidemann, Robin R', 'Behrendt, Rayk', 'Schoedel, Kristina B', 'Muller, Werner', 'Roers, Axel', 'Gerbaulet, Alexander']","['Weidemann RR', 'Behrendt R', 'Schoedel KB', 'Muller W', 'Roers A', 'Gerbaulet A']","['Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

Here we show that IKAROS regulates this developmental stage by positive and negative regulation of superenhancers with distinct lineage affiliations. IKAROS defines superenhancers at pre-B-cell differentiation genes together with B-cell master regulators such as PAX5, EBF1, and IRF4 but is required for a highly permissive chromatin environment, a function that cannot be compensated for by the other transcription factors. IKAROS is also highly enriched at inactive enhancers of genes normally expressed in stem-epithelial cells. Upon IKAROS loss, expression of pre-B-cell differentiation genes is attenuated, while a group of extralineage transcription factors that are directly repressed by IKAROS and depend on EBF1 relocalization at their enhancers for expression is induced. LHX2, LMO2, and TEAD-YAP1, normally kept separate from native B-cell transcription regulators by IKAROS, now cooperate directly with them in a de novo superenhancer network with its own feed-forward transcriptional reinforcement. Induction of de novo superenhancers antagonizes Polycomb repression and superimposes aberrant stem-epithelial cell properties in a B-cell precursor. This dual mechanism of IKAROS regulation promotes differentiation while safeguarding against a hybrid stem-epithelial-B-cell phenotype that underlies high-risk B-ALL.","['Hu, Yeguang', 'Zhang, Zhihong', 'Kashiwagi, Mariko', 'Yoshida, Toshimi', 'Joshi, Ila', 'Jena, Nilamani', 'Somasundaram, Rajesh', 'Emmanuel, Akinola Olumide', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael', 'Fitamant, Julien', 'El-Bardeesy, Nabeel', 'Gounari, Fotini', 'Van Etten, Richard A', 'Georgopoulos, Katia']","['Hu Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Kashiwagi M', 'Yoshida T', 'Joshi I', 'Jena N', 'Somasundaram R', 'Emmanuel AO', 'Sigvardsson M', 'Fitamant J', 'El-Bardeesy N', 'Gounari F', 'Van Etten RA', 'Georgopoulos K']","['Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;', 'Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;', 'Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;', 'Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;', 'Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;', 'Department of Medicine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California 92868, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California 92868, USA;', 'Department for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, 58185 Linkoping, Sweden;', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA;', 'Department for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, 58185 Linkoping, Sweden;', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA;', 'Department of Medicine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California 92868, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California 92868, USA;', 'Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5066240,,2016/09/25 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['30/17/1971 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.283762.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2016 Sep 1;30(17):1971-90. doi: 10.1101/gad.283762.116.,"['R21 AI124326/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007090/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190964/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,['(c) 2016 Hu et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*LHX2', '*PRC2', '*TEAD', '*YAP1', '*self-renewal']",,,,,,,,['2017/03/01 00:00'],,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are the two most commonly targeted immune checkpoint molecules. Although the role of antibodies that target CTLA-4 and PD-1 has been established in solid tumor malignancies and Food and Drug Administration approved for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, there remains a desperate need to incorporate immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies. Unlike solid tumors, a number of considerations must be addressed to appropriately employ immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies. For example, hematologic malignancies frequently obliterate the bone marrow and lymph nodes, which are critical immune organs that must be restored for appropriate response to immune checkpoint inhibition. On the other hand, hematologic malignancies are the quintessential immune responsive tumor type, as proven by the success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in hematologic malignancies. Also, sharing an immune cell lineage, malignant hematologic cells often express immune checkpoint molecules that are absent in solid tumor cells, thereby offering direct targets for immune checkpoint inhibition. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the potential for immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies before and after allo-SCT. The ongoing clinical studies and complimentary immune correlatives are providing a growing body of knowledge regarding the role of immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies, which will likely become part of the standard of care for hematologic malignancies.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Daver, Naval', 'Mittendorf, Elizabeth A']","['Alatrash G', 'Daver N', 'Mittendorf EA']","['Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (G.A., E.A.M.), Leukemia (N.D.), and Breast Surgical (E.A.M.)

MDS/MPN-RS-T was previously a provisional category known as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis (RARS-T) which has now attained a distinct designation in the 2016 WHO classification. In this review, we focus on biology and management of aCML, MDS/MPN-U, and MDS/MPN-RS-T. There is considerable overlap between these entities which we attempt to further elucidate in this review. We also discuss recent advances in the field of molecular landscape that further defines and characterizes this heterogeneous group of disorders. The paucity of clinical trials available secondary to unclear pathogenesis and rarity of these diseases makes the management of these entities clinically challenging. This review summarizes some of the current knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and suggested treatment guidelines based on the available data.","['Talati, Chetasi', 'Padron, Eric']","['Talati C', 'Padron E']","['H.

Whether inflammation occurs in other brain areas remains unknown. This study tested the effect of short-term HFD on cytokine gene expression and identified leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a responsive cytokine in the brain stem. Thus, functional and cellular effects of LIF in the brain stem were investigated. METHODS: Male rats were fed chow or HFD for 3 days, and then gene expression was analyzed in different brain regions for IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and LIF. The effect of intracerebroventricular injection of LIF on chow intake and body weight was also tested. Patch clamp recording was performed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). RESULTS: HFD increased pontine TNF-alpha mRNA while downregulating LIF in all major parts of the brain stem, but not in the hypothalamus or hippocampus. LIF injection into the cerebral aqueduct suppressed food intake without conditioned taste aversion, suggesting that LIF can induce anorexia via lower brain regions without causing malaise. In the NTS, a key brain stem nucleus for food intake regulation, LIF induced acute changes in neuronal excitability. CONCLUSIONS: HFD-induced downregulation of anorexic LIF in the brain stem may provide a permissive condition for HFD overconsumption. This may be at least partially mediated by the NTS.","['Licursi, Maria', 'Alberto, Christian O', 'Dias, Alex', 'Hirasawa, Kensuke', 'Hirasawa, Michiru']","['Licursi M', 'Alberto CO', 'Dias A', 'Hirasawa K', 'Hirasawa M']","[""Division of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada."", ""Division of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada."", ""Division of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada."", ""Division of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada."", ""Division of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. michiru@mun.ca.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160924,United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,IM,"['Animals', 'Anorexia/*physiopathology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Brain Stem/*metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Hypothalamus/metabolism', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Solitary Nucleus/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/oby.21647 [doi]'],ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2016 Nov;24(11):2361-2367. doi: 10.1002/oby.21647.

The quintessential property of these cells is their ability to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system of hemoablated recipients. This characteristic has enabled HSCs to be used to replenish the hematopoietic system of patients after chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Here, we use deletion of the monocytic leukemia zinc finger gene (Moz/Kat6a/Myst3) to examine the effects of removing HSCs. Loss of MOZ in adult mice leads to the rapid loss of HSCs as defined by transplantation. This is accompanied by a reduction of the LSK-CD48(-)CD150(+) and LSK-CD34(-)Flt3(-) populations in the bone marrow and a reduction in quiescent cells in G0 Surprisingly, the loss of classically defined HSCs did not affect mouse viability, and there was no recovery of the LSK-CD48(-)CD150(+) and LSK-CD34(-)Flt3(-) populations 15 to 18 months after Moz deletion. Clonal analysis of myeloid progenitors, which produce short-lived granulocytes, demonstrate that these are derived from cells that had undergone recombination at the Moz locus up to 2 years earlier, suggesting that early progenitors have acquired extended self-renewal. Our results establish that there are essential differences in HSC requirement for steady-state blood cell production compared with the artificial situation of reconstitution after transplantation into a hemoablated host. A better understanding of steady-state hematopoiesis may facilitate the development of novel therapies engaging hematopoietic cell populations with previously unrecognized traits, as well as characterizing potential vulnerability to oncogenic transformation.","['Sheikh, Bilal N', 'Yang, Yuqing', 'Schreuder, Jaring', 'Nilsson, Susan K', 'Bilardi, Rebecca', 'Carotta, Sebastian', 'McRae, Helen M', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Thomas, Tim']","['Sheikh BN', 'Yang Y', 'Schreuder J', 'Nilsson SK', 'Bilardi R', 'Carotta S', 'McRae HM', 'Metcalf D', 'Voss AK', 'Thomas T']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Manufacturing Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Clayton, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160923,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2016/09/25 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2015/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33991-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-676072 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Nov 10;128(19):2307-2318. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-676072.

We sequenced the DNA from cases with unexplained dominant thrombocytopenia and identified six likely pathogenic variants in ETV6, of which five are novel. We observed low repressive activity of all tested ETV6 variants, and variants located in the E26 transformation-specific binding domain (encoding p.A377T, p.Y401N) led to reduced binding to corepressors. We also observed a large expansion of megakaryocyte colony-forming units derived from variant carriers and reduced proplatelet formation with abnormal cytoskeletal organization. The defect in proplatelet formation was also observed in control CD34(+) cell-derived megakaryocytes transduced with lentiviral particles encoding mutant ETV6. Reduced expression levels of key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton CDC42 and RHOA were measured. Moreover, changes in the actin structures are typically accompanied by a rounder platelet shape with a highly heterogeneous size, decreased platelet arachidonic response, and spreading and retarded clot retraction in ETV6 deficient platelets. Elevated numbers of circulating CD34(+) cells were found in p.P214L and p.Y401N carriers, and two patients from different families suffered from refractory anemia with excess blasts, while one patient from a third family was successfully treated for acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the role of ETV6 as a driver of cytoskeletal regulatory gene expression during platelet production, and the impact of variants resulting in platelets with altered size, shape and function and potentially also in changes in circulating progenitor levels.","['Poggi, Marjorie', 'Canault, Matthias', 'Favier, Marie', 'Turro, Ernest', 'Saultier, Paul', 'Ghalloussi, Dorsaf', 'Baccini, Veronique', 'Vidal, Lea', 'Mezzapesa, Anna', 'Chelghoum, Nadjim', 'Mohand-Oumoussa, Badreddine', 'Falaise, Celine', 'Favier, Remi', 'Ouwehand, Willem H', 'Fiore, Mathieu', 'Peiretti, Franck', 'Morange, Pierre Emmanuel', 'Saut, Noemie', 'Bernot, Denis', 'Greinacher, Andreas', 'BioResource, Nihr', 'Nurden, Alan T', 'Nurden, Paquita', 'Freson, Kathleen', 'Tregouet, David-Alexandre', 'Raslova, Hana', 'Alessi, Marie-Christine']","['Poggi M', 'Canault M', 'Favier M', 'Turro E', 'Saultier P', 'Ghalloussi D', 'Baccini V', 'Vidal L', 'Mezzapesa A', 'Chelghoum N', 'Mohand-Oumoussa B', 'Falaise C', 'Favier R', 'Ouwehand WH', 'Fiore M', 'Peiretti F', 'Morange PE', 'Saut N', 'Bernot D', 'Greinacher A', 'BioResource N', 'Nurden AT', 'Nurden P', 'Freson K', 'Tregouet DA', 'Raslova H', 'Alessi MC']","['Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, University Paris Sud, Equipe labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Haematology and National Health Service Blood & Transplant, Cambridge University, UK.', 'MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Post-Genomic Platform of Pitie-Salpetriere (P3S), Pierre and Marie Curie University, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Post-Genomic Platform of Pitie-Salpetriere (P3S), Pierre and Marie Curie University, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'French Reference-Center on Inherited Platelet Disorders, Marseille, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology and National Health Service Blood & Transplant, Cambridge University, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'French Reference-Center on Inherited Platelet Disorders, Marseille, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, CHU de Bordeaux, Pessac, France."", 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'French Reference-Center on Inherited Platelet Disorders, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'French Reference-Center on Inherited Platelet Disorders, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INRA, NORT, Marseille, France.', 'Institute for Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Germany.', 'NIHR BioResource -

While the beta-substituted natural products and their synthetic analogs are potent inhibitors of human cancer cell growth, less is known about their alpha-substituted counterparts. Recently, we synthesized a series of alpha-substituted tropolones including 2-hydroxy-7-(naphthalen-2-yl)cyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-one (alpha-naphthyl tropolone). Here, we evaluate the antiproliferative mechanisms of alpha-naphthyl tropolone and the related alpha-benzodioxinyl analog. The alpha-substituted tropolones inhibit growth of lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not healthy blood cells, with nanomolar potency. Treatment of leukemia cell lines with the tropolone dose-dependently induces apoptosis as judged by staining with annexin V and propidium iodide and Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase 3 and 7. Moreover, pre-treatment of cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited the apoptotic effects of the tropolone in two lymphocytic lines. Caspase inhibition also blocked elevated histone acetylation caused by the tropolone, indicating that its effects on histone acetylation are potentiated by caspases. In contrast, alpha-naphthyl tropolone upregulated p53 expression and phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR in a manner that was not rescued by caspase inhibition. The effects of tropolone were blocked by co-incubation with high levels of free extracellular iron but not by pre-loading with iron.

The identification of such strategies is typically based on a mathematical model of the process to be altered through targeted control inputs. This paper focuses on processes at the molecular level that determine the state of an individual cell, involving signaling or gene regulation. The mathematical model type considered is that of Boolean networks. The potential control targets can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. RESULTS: This paper presents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in Boolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach exploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control candidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of polynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find such controllers. The control methods in this paper are validated through the identification of combinatorial interventions in the signaling pathways of previously reported control targets in two well studied systems, a p53-mdm2 network and a blood T cell lymphocyte granular leukemia survival signaling network. Supplementary data is available online and our code in Macaulay2 and Matlab are available via http://www.ms.uky.edu/~dmu228/ControlAlg . CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a novel method for the identification of intervention targets in Boolean network models. The results in this paper show that the proposed methods are useful and efficient for moderately large networks.","['Murrugarra, David', 'Veliz-Cuba, Alan', 'Aguilar, Boris', 'Laubenbacher, Reinhard']","['Murrugarra D', 'Veliz-Cuba A', 'Aguilar B', 'Laubenbacher R']","['Department of Mathematics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40506-0027, KY, USA. murrugarra@uky.edu.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Dayton, Dayton, 45469, OH, USA.', 'Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, 98109-5263, WA, USA.', 'Center for Quantitative Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, 06030-6033, CT, USA.', 'Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, 06030, CT, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,,,PMC5035508,,2016/09/25 06:00,2016/09/25 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-016-0332-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-016-0332-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2016 Sep 23;10(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s12918-016-0332-x.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Algebraic control', 'Blocking transitions', 'Boolean networks', 'Edge deletions', 'Network control']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of Shh-Gli1 signaling in glioma progression has been reported. However, its role in glioma chemoresistance has not been well studied yet. In this work, we found that Shh-Gli1 signaling regulates the expression of one stem cell marker, BMI1 (B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus), in glioma. Interestingly, we also demonstrated high expression of MRP1 (multi-drug resistance protein 1) in glioma. MRP1 expression was decreased by BMI1 siRNA and Shh-Gli1 cell signaling specific inhibitor GANT61 in our experiments. GANT61 very efficiently inhibited cell colony growth in glioma cell lines, compared to temozolomide. Moreover, a synergic effect of GANT61 and temozolomide drastically decreased the LD50 of temozolomide in the cell colony experiments. Therefore, our results suggest that there is a potential nexus of Shh-Gli1-BMI1 cell signaling to regulate MRP1 and to promote chemoresistance in glioma. Henceforth, our study opens the possibility of facing new targets, Gli1 and BMI1, for the effective treatment of glioma suppression of chemoresistance with adjuvant therapy of GANT61 and temozolomide.","['Shahi, M H', 'Farheen, S', 'Mariyath, M P M', 'Castresana, J S']","['Shahi MH', 'Farheen S', 'Mariyath MP', 'Castresana JS']","['Interdisciplinary Brain Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, UP, 202002, India. mehdihayat@gmail.com.', 'Interdisciplinary Brain Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, UP, 202002, India.', 'Interdisciplinary Brain Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, UP, 202002, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra School of Sciences, Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glioma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/09/25 06:00,2017/03/01 06:00,['2016/09/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5365-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5365-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Nov;37(11):15107-15114. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5365-7.

Although it has been known for a long time that 19(S)-HETE has vascular effects, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. In this study we show that 19(S)-HETE induces cAMP accumulation in the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line MEG-01. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 520 nM, insensitive to pharmacological inhibition of COX-1/2 and required the expression of the G-protein Gs. Systematic siRNA-mediated knock-down of each G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in MEG-01 followed by functional analysis identified the prostacyclin receptor (IP) as the mediator of the effects of 19(S)-HETE, and the heterologously expressed IP receptor was also activated by 19(S)-HETE in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 567 nM. Pretreatment of isolated murine platelets with 19(S)-HETE blocked thrombin-induced platelets aggregation, an effect not seen in platelets from mice lacking the IP receptor. Furthermore, 19(S)-HETE was able to relax mouse mesenteric artery- and thoracic aorta-derived vessel segments. While pharmacological inhibition of COX-1/2 enzymes had no effect on the vasodilatory activity of 19(S)-HETE these effects were not observed in vessels from mice lacking the IP receptor. These results identify a novel mechanism of action for the CYP450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolite 19(S)-HETE and point to the existence of a broader spectrum of naturally occurring prostanoid receptor agonists.","['Tunaru, Sorin', 'Chennupati, Ramesh', 'Nusing, Rolf M', 'Offermanns, Stefan']","['Tunaru S', 'Chennupati R', 'Nusing RM', 'Offermanns S']","['Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Department of Pharmacology, Ludwigstr. 43, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Department of Pharmacology, Ludwigstr. 43, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Pharmacology, J.W.

Paired diagnostic/relapse samples of 35 patients revealed stable high BAALC expression in 89%, irrespective of a high proportion of clonal evolution found in 49% of these cases. High BAALC expression, both directly after induction chemotherapy and within 3-6 months after induction chemotherapy, correlated significantly with shorter event-free survival and overall survival. Moreover, 8 of 10 patients displaying high BAALC expression levels after completion of induction therapy as well as 5 of 5 patients exhibiting high BAALC expression levels within 3-6 months after induction chemotherapy experienced relapse with a median of 197 and 101 days, respectively, from sampling to relapse. Thus, BAALC expression-based MRD detection during therapy may be considered a strategy to identify patients at high risk of relapse.","['Weber, Simone', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Perglerova, Karolina', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang']","['Weber S', 'Haferlach T', 'Alpermann T', 'Perglerova K', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W']","['MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL2 s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic.', 'MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/24 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14343 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Dec;175(5):904-916. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14343.

Estimates of complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) were weighted by the frequency distribution of prognostic factors in the blinatumomab trial. Outcomes were also compared between the trial and historical data using propensity score methods. The historical cohort included 694 patients with CR data and 1112 patients with OS data compared with 189 patients with CR and survival data in the blinatumomab trial. The weighted analysis revealed a CR rate of 24% (95% CI: 20-27%) and a median OS of 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.8-3.6) in the historical cohort compared with a CR/CRh rate of 43% (95% CI: 36-50%) and a median OS of 6.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-7.5) in the blinatumomab trial. Propensity score analysis estimated increased odds of CR/CRh (OR=2.68, 95% CI: 1.67-4.31) and improved OS (HR=0.536, 95% CI: 0.394-0.730) with blinatumomab.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment but is associated with a risk of delayed engraftment and graft failure. In this study, patients with myelofibrosis (n=31) and acute myeloid leukemia (n=31) were analyzed for time to engraftment, graft failure and engraftment-related factors. Early and late neutrophil engraftment and late thrombocyte engraftment were significantly delayed in patients with myelofibrosis as compared to acute myeloid leukemia, and graft failure only occurred in myelofibrosis (6%). Only spleen size had a significant influence on engraftment efficiency in myelofibrosis patients. To analyze the cause for the engraftment defect, clearance of hematopoietic stem cells from peripheral blood was measured and immunohistological staining of bone marrow sections was performed. Numbers of circulating CD34(+) were significantly reduced at early time points in myelofibrosis patients, whereas CD34(+)CD38(-) and colony-forming cells showed no significant difference in clearance. Staining of bone marrow sections for homing proteins revealed a loss of VCAM-1 in myelofibrosis with a corresponding significant increase in the level of soluble VCAM-1 within the peripheral blood. In conclusion, our data suggest that reduced engraftment and graft failure in myelofibrosis patients is caused by an early pooling of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells in the spleen and a bone marrow homing defect caused by the loss of VCAM-1. Improved engraftment in myelofibrosis might be achieved by approaches that reduce spleen size and cleavage of VCAM-1 in these patients prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Hart, Christina', 'Klatt, Sabine', 'Barop, Johann', 'Muller, Gunnar', 'Schelker, Roland', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Huber, Elisabeth', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Grassinger, Jochen']","['Hart C', 'Klatt S', 'Barop J', 'Muller G', 'Schelker R', 'Holler E', 'Huber E', 'Herr W', 'Grassinger J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany christina.hart@ukr.de.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Delayed Graft Function/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/*therapy', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism']",PMC5394870,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.146811 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.146811 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Nov;101(11):1407-1416. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.146811.

C-reactive protein and ferritin were centrally quantified by ELISA from cryopreserved plasma whereas each center provided pre-transplant albumin.

METHODS: The potential efficacy of the Ibrutinib/Nutlin-3 combination was evaluated in vitro in a panel of B leukemic cell lines (EHEB, JVM-2, JVM-3, MEC-1, MEC-2) and in primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patient samples, by assessing cell viability, cell cycle profile, apoptosis and intracellular pathway modulations. Validation of the combination therapy was assessed in a B leukemic xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: Ibrutinib exhibited variable anti-leukemic activity in vitro and the combination with Nutlin-3 synergistically enhanced the induction of apoptosis independently from the p53 status. Indeed, the Ibrutinib/Nutlin-3 combination was effective in promoting cytotoxicity also in primary B-CLL samples carrying 17p13 deletion and/or TP53 mutations, already in therapy with Ibrutinib. Molecular analyses performed on both B-leukemic cell lines as well as on primary B-CLL samples, while confirming the switch-off of the MAPK and PI3K pro-survival pathways by Ibrutinib, indicated that the synergism of action with Nutlin-3 was independent by p53 pathway and was accompanied by the activation of the DNA damage cascade signaling through the phosphorylation of the histone protein H2A.X. This observation was confirmed also in the JVM-2 B leukemic xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data emphasize that the Ibrutinib/Nutlin-3 combination merits to be further evaluated as a therapeutic option for B-CLL.","['Voltan, Rebecca', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Casciano, Fabio', 'Arcidiacono, Maria Vittoria', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Voltan R', 'Rimondi E', 'Melloni E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Casciano F', 'Arcidiacono MV', 'Celeghini C', 'Cuneo A', 'Zauli G', 'Secchiero P']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperidines', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5342579,,2016/09/24 06:00,2018/02/28 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['12139 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12139 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 25;7(43):70623-70638. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12139.,,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B leukemic cells', 'Ibrutinib', 'MDM-2 inhibitors', 'apoptosis', 'combination therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosed by flow cytometry and PCR from aqueous humor.,e4967,10.1097/MD.0000000000004967 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia (MNKL) is a rare type of leukemia, and ocular complications have not previously been reported. We now report a patient with MNKL who developed intraocular infiltrates during follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 13-year-old boy diagnosed with MNKL developed left eye pain 3 months after starting treatment. Examination of the left eye revealed a visual acuity of counting fingers at 20 cm, ciliary hyperemia, small corneal keratic precipitates, hypopyon, grade 4 vitreous opacities, and an obscured fundus. The differential diagnosis was between an opportunistic infection associated with immunodeficiency and an intraocular leukemic cell infiltrate. Therefore, a sample of aqueous humor was aspirated. Multiplex PCR/broad-range PCR of the aqueous humor was below detection limits for viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Flow cytometry (FCM) detected NK-related CD56-positive cells, thus leading to a diagnosis of ocular infiltrates due to MNKL. With treatment of the ocular infiltrates by consolidation systemic chemotherapy including intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), there was clearing of the vitreous opacities; and optic disc swelling, retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and protuberant lesions were now seen. With the addition of local radiation therapy to the eye, there was a dramatic treatment response, with regression of the optic disc findings and retinal lesions, and an improved visual acuity of 1.5. CONCLUSION: We encountered the first case of MNKL in which ocular infiltrates developed during follow-up. Multiplex PCR and FCM of the aqueous humor were useful in rapidly distinguishing leukemic cell infiltrates from an opportunistic infection. This case highlights the usefulness of intrathecal MTX and local radiotherapy in treating ocular infiltrates in patients with MNKL.","['Akaike, Sayaka', 'Kamoi, Koju', 'Tezuka, Mari', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Yoshimura, Ryoichi', 'Takagi, Masatoshi', 'Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko']","['Akaike S', 'Kamoi K', 'Tezuka M', 'Tomizawa D', 'Yoshimura R', 'Takagi M', 'Ohno-Matsui K']","[""Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan Department of Radiation Therapeutics and Oncology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Aqueous Humor/cytology', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eye Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC5044928,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],2016/09/24 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000004967 [doi]', '00005792-201609200-00048 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Sep;95(38):e4967. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004967.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histopathological examination has demonstrated a metastatic phyllodes tumor. After postoperative chemotherapy treatment, a longer survival has been achieved, which is more than 72 months. RESULTS: Our case report describes a breast PT with several local recurrences and a rare metastasis (pelvic cavity), but long-term overall survival was achieved after surgery and chemotherapy.

The Notch- Delta-Serrate-Lag2 (DSL) signaling pathway is considered essential for the maintenance of neural stem cells, but it is not known if it is necessary for the expansion of the NSPs subsequent to perinatal H-I injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether this pathway contributes to NSP expansion in the SVZ after H-I and, if so, to establish whether this pathway is directly induced by H-I or regulated by paracrine factors. Here we report that Notch1 receptor induction and one of its ligands, Delta-like 1, precedes NSP expansion after perinatal H-I in P6 rat pups and that this increase occurs specifically in the most medial cell layers of the SVZ where the stem cells reside. Pharmacologically inhibiting Notch signaling in vivo diminished NSP expansion. With an in vitro model of H-I, Notch1 was not induced directly by hypoxia, but was stimulated by soluble factors, specifically leukemia inhibitory factor, produced by astrocytes within the SVZ.

It usually occurs in elderly patients with a mean age between 60 and 70 years. Despite initial response to chemotherapy, the disease regularly relapses with a short median overall survival. Better outcomes have been reported with high-dose acute leukemia-like induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, elderly patients are not candidates for intensive therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. So, new active and tolerable drugs are needed. Our case illustrates that one cycle of lenalidomide and celecoxib provides at least a partial cutaneous and hematologic response, but this regimen was discontinued due to toxicity and followed by a consolidation/maintenance phase with azacitidine, thus achieving a final complete response with a much higher than expected progression-free and overall survival in an elderly patient with comorbidities. This information may be useful in the design of treatment approaches for elderly patients with blastic plasmocytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. However, it should be confirmed in clinical trials as well as by optimizing the induction and extending the consolidation/maintenance period to avoid early relapses after discontinuation and improve progression-free survival.","['Garcia-Recio, Marta', 'Martinez-Serra, Jordi', 'Bento, Leyre', 'Ramos, Rafael', 'Gines, Jordi', 'Daumal, Jaime', 'Sampol, Antonia', 'Gutierrez, Antonio']","['Garcia-Recio M', 'Martinez-Serra J', 'Bento L', 'Ramos R', 'Gines J', 'Daumal J', 'Sampol A', 'Gutierrez A']","['Service of Hematology; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa).', 'Service of Hematology; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa).', 'Service of Hematology; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa).', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa); Service of Pathology.', 'Pharmacy Department.', 'Service of Nuclear Medicine, Son Espases University Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Service of Hematology; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa).', 'Service of Hematology; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa).']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160907,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,PMC5019433,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:01,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S107893 [doi]', 'ott-9-5507 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Sep 7;9:5507-11. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S107893. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['COX-2', 'blastic plasmocytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', 'elderly', 'hypomethylating', 'immunomodulatory']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we employed magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNP-Fe3O4) to improve the therapeutic effect of HHT and investigated its biological effects. Within a certain range of concentrations, the HHT-MNP-Fe3O4 showed a more enhanced inhibitory effect on the selected myeloid leukemia cell lines than HHT alone. Compared with HHT, HHT-MNP-Fe3O4 could induce more extensive apoptosis in leukemia cells, which also showed more pronounced cell arrests at G0/G1 phase. HHT-MNP-Fe3O4 enhanced antitumor activity by downregulating myeloid cell leukemia-1, which could inhibit the activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase. In vivo experiments using tumor-bearing animal models showed that the mean tumor volume with HHT-MNP-Fe3O4 was significantly smaller than that with HHT alone (193+/-26 mm(3) versus 457+/-100 mm(3), P<0.05), while the mean weight was 0.67+/-0.03 g versus 1.42+/-0.56 g (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical study showed fewer myeloid cell leukemia-1-stained cells in mice treated with HHT-MNP-Fe3O4 than with the controls. These findings provide a more efficient delivery system for HHT in the treatment of hematological malignancy.","['Chen, Meiyu', 'Xiong, Fei', 'Ma, Liang', 'Yao, Hong', 'Wang, Qinrong', 'Wen, Lijun', 'Wang, Qian', 'Gu, Ning', 'Chen, Suning']","['Chen M', 'Xiong F', 'Ma L', 'Yao H', 'Wang Q', 'Wen L', 'Wang Q', 'Gu N', 'Chen S']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', ""State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing; Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.', ""State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing; Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,,,PMC5019325,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S105543 [doi]', 'ijn-11-4413 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2016 Sep 6;11:4413-4422. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S105543. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HHT', 'leukemia', 'magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles', 'magnetic nanoparticles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, hPSCs are unstable in classical naive mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) WNT and MEK/ERK signal inhibition (2i) culture. We show that a broad repertoire of conventional hESC and transgene-independent human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines could be reverted to stable human preimplantation inner cell mass (ICM)-like naive states with only WNT, MEK/ERK, and tankyrase inhibition (LIF-3i). LIF-3i-reverted hPSCs retained normal karyotypes and genomic imprints, and attained defining mouse ESC-like functional features, including high clonal self-renewal, independence from MEK/ERK signaling, dependence on JAK/STAT3 and BMP4 signaling, and naive-specific transcriptional and epigenetic configurations. Tankyrase inhibition promoted a stable acquisition of a human preimplantation ICM-like ground state via modulation of WNT signaling, and was most efficacious in efficiently reprogrammed conventional hiPSCs. Importantly, naive reversion of a broad repertoire of conventional hiPSCs reduced lineage-primed gene expression and significantly improved their multilineage differentiation capacities. Stable naive hPSCs with reduced genetic variability and improved functional pluripotency will have great utility in regenerative medicine and human disease modeling.","['Zimmerlin, Ludovic', 'Park, Tea Soon', 'Huo, Jeffrey S', 'Verma, Karan', 'Pather, Sarshan R', 'Talbot, C Conover Jr', 'Agarwal, Jasmin', 'Steppan, Diana', 'Zhang, Yang W', 'Considine, Michael', 'Guo, Hong', 'Zhong, Xiufeng', 'Gutierrez, Christian', 'Cope, Leslie', 'Canto-Soler, M Valeria', 'Friedman, Alan D', 'Baylin, Stephen B', 'Zambidis, Elias T']","['Zimmerlin L', 'Park TS', 'Huo JS', 'Verma K', 'Pather SR', 'Talbot CC Jr', 'Agarwal J', 'Steppan D', 'Zhang YW', 'Considine M', 'Guo H', 'Zhong X', 'Gutierrez C', 'Cope L', 'Canto-Soler MV', 'Friedman AD', 'Baylin SB', 'Zambidis ET']","['Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA ezambid1@jhmi.edu.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160922,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Self Renewal/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Germ Layers/embryology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tankyrases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology']",PMC5201042,['The authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],2016/11/02 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['dev.138982 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.138982 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2016 Dec 1;143(23):4368-4380. doi: 10.1242/dev.138982.

We performed a systematic review to identify prospective randomized controlled trials comparing allo-HCT against novel therapies for treatment of CLL at various disease stages. In the absence of such data, we invited physicians with expertise in allo-HCT and/or CLL to participate in developing these recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. For standard-risk CLL we recommend allo-HCT in the absence of response or if there is evidence of disease progression after B cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors. For high-risk CLL an allo-HCT is recommended after failing 2 lines of therapy and showing an objective response to BCR inhibitors or to a clinical trial. It is also recommended for patients who fail to show an objective response or progress after BCR inhibitors and receive BCL-2 inhibitors, regardless of whether an objective response is achieved. For Richter transformation, we recommend allo-HCT upon demonstration of an objective response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. A reduced-intensity conditioning regimen is recommended whenever indicated. These recommendations highlight the rapidly changing treatment landscape of CLL. Newer therapies have disrupted prior paradigms, and allo-HCT is now relegated to later stages of relapsed or refractory CLL.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Gribben, John', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Moreno, Carol', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Reddy, Nishitha M', 'Sorror, Mohamed', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Carpenter, Paul', 'Savani, Bipin N']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Kumar A', 'Hamadani M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Ghia P', 'Anasetti C', 'Dreger P', 'Montserrat E', 'Perales MA', 'Alyea EP', 'Awan FT', 'Ayala E', 'Barrientos JC', 'Brown JR', 'Castro JE', 'Furman RR', 'Gribben J', 'Hill BT', 'Mohty M', 'Moreno C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pavletic SZ', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Reddy NM', 'Sorror M', 'Bredeson C', 'Carpenter P', 'Savani BN']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs with pivotal roles in cellular and molecular processes related to different malignancies including CLL. Recently, some studies have shown that miR-192 plays a key role in CLL pathogenesis through increasing CDKN1A/p21 levels, suppression of Bcl-2 and enhancement of wild-type P53 and cell cycle arrest. Forty samples, including 20 patients with CLL, diagnosed in Omid hospital (Isfahan, Iran) and 20 healthy controls were sampled during a period of 4 months. Using real-time PCR method, expression of miR-192 was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CLL patients in comparison with healthy subjects. In silico molecular signaling pathway enrichment analysis was also performed on validated and predicted targets (targetome) of miR-192 in DAVID database to explore possible role of miR-192 in some pathways. The expression of miR-192 was found to be significantly reduced (~2.5-folds) in CLL patients compared with healthy subjects (P=0.002). In silico molecular signaling pathway enrichment analysis detected cell indicated signaling pathway as one of the most statistically relevant pathway with miR-192 targetome. Our findings showed that miR-192 could be a biomarker for early diagnosis of CLL.","['Fathullahzadeh, S', 'Mirzaei, H', 'Honardoost, M A', 'Sahebkar, A', 'Salehi, M']","['Fathullahzadeh S', 'Mirzaei H', 'Honardoost MA', 'Sahebkar A', 'Salehi M']","['Medical Biotechnology Research Center, Ashkezar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ashkezar, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160923,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,2016/10/27 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['cgt201634 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2016.34 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2016 Oct;23(10):327-332. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2016.34.

In breast cancer, expression of IP genes was determined by the abundance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and high expression of IP genes was associated with longer survival. In contrast, IP upregulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was a cell-intrinsic feature that was not associated with longer survival. Expression of IP genes in AML was IFN-independent, correlated with the methylation status of IP genes, and was particularly high in AML with an M5 phenotype and/or MLL rearrangement. Notably, PSMB8 inhibition led to accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and cell death in IP(high) but not IP(low) AML cells. Co-clustering analysis revealed that genes correlated with IP subunits in non-M5 AMLs were primarily implicated in immune processes. However, in M5 AML, IP genes were primarily co-regulated with genes involved in cell metabolism and proliferation, mitochondrial activity and stress responses. We conclude that M5 AML cells can upregulate IP genes in a cell-intrinsic manner in order to resist cell stress.","['Rouette, Alexandre', 'Trofimov, Assya', 'Haberl, David', 'Boucher, Genevieve', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', ""D'Angelo, Giovanni"", 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Perreault, Claude']","['Rouette A', 'Trofimov A', 'Haberl D', 'Boucher G', 'Lavallee VP', ""D'Angelo G"", 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G', 'Lemieux S', 'Perreault C']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5034284,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['srep34019 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34019 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 23;6:34019. doi: 10.1038/srep34019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether we could introduce the receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM/HMMR/CD168), another clinically relevant tumor-associated antigen, into these mo-DCs through mRNA electroporation and elicit RHAMM-specific immune responses. While RHAMM mRNA electroporation significantly increased RHAMM protein expression by mo-DCs, our data indicate that classical mo-DCs already express and present RHAMM at sufficient levels to activate RHAMM-specific T cells, regardless of electroporation. Moreover, we found that RHAMM-specific T cells are present at vaccination sites in AML patients.

However, we found that ISG15 and de-ISGylase USP18 were induced by several anti-cancer agents, which was confirmed by both RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays. Further studies demonstrated that ectopic ISG15 and USP18 inhibited proliferation of myeloma, leukemia and cervical cancer cells. More importantly, ISG15 and USP18 induced cancer cell apoptosis. This finding was confirmed in a cervical xenograft model in which cervical cancer growth was suppressed by lentiviral ISG15. In the mechanistic study, ISG15 was found to disrupt the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by downregulating the expression of IKKbeta and p65, phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaBalpha. Consistent with this finding, ISG15 suppressed the expression of NF-kappaB recognition element-driving luciferase and decreased the transcription of XIAP and Mcl-1, two typical genes regulated by NF-kappaB. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that ISG15 induces cancer cell apoptosis by disrupting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This study highlighted a novel role of ISG15 in tumor suppression.","['Mao, Hongwu', 'Wang, Man', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Zhou, Haibin', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Mao H', 'Wang M', 'Cao B', 'Zhou H', 'Zhang Z', 'Mao X']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Translational Research and Therapeutics of Neuro-Psycho-Diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.R.

Here, we present evidence to support the role of common drug interactions and low vitamin B12 levels in potentiating methotrexate neurotoxicity. METHODS: We review the published evidence and highlight key potential drug interactions as well as present clinical evidence of severe methotrexate neurotoxicity in conjunction with nitrous oxide anesthesia and measurements of vitamin B12 levels among pediatric leukemia patients during therapy. RESULTS: We describe a very plausible mechanism for methotrexate neurotoxicity in pediatric leukemia patients involving reduction in methionine and consequential disruption of myelin production. We provide evidence that a number of commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric leukemia management interact with the same folate biosynthetic pathways and/or reduce functional vitamin B12 levels and hence are likely to increase the toxicity of methotrexate in these patients. We also present a brief case study supporting out hypothesis that nitrous oxide contributes to methotrexate neurotoxicity and a nutritional study, showing that vitamin B12 deficiency is common in pediatric leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Use of nitrous oxide in pediatric leukemia patients at the same time as methotrexate use should be avoided especially as many suitable alternative anesthetic agents exist. Clinicians should consider monitoring levels of vitamin B12 in patients suspected of having methotrexate-induced neurotoxic effects.","['Forster, Victoria J', 'van Delft, Frederik W', 'Baird, Susan F', 'Mair, Shona', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Halsey, Christina']","['Forster VJ', 'van Delft FW', 'Baird SF', 'Mair S', 'Skinner R', 'Halsey C']","[""Paul O'Gorman Building, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK. victoria.forster@ncl.ac.uk."", ""Paul O'Gorman Building, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK."", 'Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, UK.', ""Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160922,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Myelin Sheath/metabolism', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Nitrous Oxide/metabolism', 'Nutritional Status', 'Seizures/chemically induced', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/chemically induced/metabolism']",PMC5083755,['All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],2016/10/28 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-016-3153-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-016-3153-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2016 Nov;78(5):1093-1096. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3153-0.

However, very few data are available regarding its efficacy and toxicity in elderly patients with CML outside clinical trials. To address this issue, we set out a ""real-life"" cohort of 65 chronic phase CML patients older than 65 years (median age 75.1 years) treated frontline with DAS in 26 Italian centers from June 2012 to June 2015, focusing our attention on toxicity and efficacy data. One third of patients (20/65: 30.7%) had 3 or more comorbidities and required concomitant therapies; according to Sokal classification, 3 patients (4.6%) were low risk, 39 (60.0%) intermediate risk, and 20 (30.8%) high risk, whereas 3 (4.6%) were not classifiable. DAS starting dose was 100 mg once a day in 54 patients (83.0%), whereas 11 patients (17.0%) received less than 100 mg/day. Grade 3/4 hematologic and extrahematologic toxicities were reported in 8 (12.3%) and 12 (18.5%) patients, respectively. Overall, 10 patients (15.4%) permanently discontinued DAS because of toxicities. Pleural effusions (all WHO grades) occurred in 12 patients (18.5%) and in 5 of them occurred during the first 3 months. DAS treatment induced in 60/65 patients (92.3%) a complete cytogenetic response and in 50/65 (76.9%) also a major molecular response.

This study examines the associations between acute leukoencephalopathy and neurobehavioural, neurocognitive, and brain white matter imaging outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with chemotherapy without cranial radiation. METHODS: In this longitudinal analysis, we used data of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN, USA) who had been treated between June 1, 2000, and Oct 31, 2010. Eligible patients were diagnosed with non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, aged at least 8 years, and survivors with at least 5 years since their initial diagnosis. Brain MRIs obtained during active therapy were systematically coded for leukoencephalopathy using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 4. At least 5 years after their diagnosis, survivors completed neurocognitive testing, another brain MRI, and their parents completed neurobehavioural ratings of their child (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]). Follow-up MRI included diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter integrity, with indices of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity from frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and in the frontostriatal tract. The neuroradiologist, who assessed abnormal MRIs, was masked to both group assignment of survivors and the neurobehavioural and neurocognitive outcomes. The primary outcomes were neurobehavioural function, assessed from completed BRIEF, and neurocognitive performance, measured by direct neurocognitive tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test). This study had completed enrolment in October, 2014, and is registered as an observational study at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01014195. FINDINGS: Between Feb 18, 2010, and Oct 22, 2014, 210 (70%) of 301 eligible survivors participated in our study of whom 190 were evaluable, 162 had an MRI. 56 participants had quantitative brain imaging data and were included in evaluable population analyses. 51 (27%) of the 190 evaluable participants had acute leukoencephalopathy. Compared with population norms, survivors were reported to have more neurobehavioural problems with working memory, organisation, initiation, and planning (p<0.001 for all). Survivors had worse scores than the general population on direct measures of memory span, processing speed, and executive function (p<0.05 for all). Survivors with a history of acute leukoencephalopathy had more neurobehavioural problems than survivors with no history of leukoencephalopathy on organisation (adjusted T-score 56.2 [95% CI 53.3-59.1] vs 52.2 [50.4-53.9], p=0.020) and initiation (55.5 [52.7-58.3] vs 52.1 [50.4-53.8], p=0.045). Survivors with acute leukoencephalopathy also had reduced white matter integrity in the frontostriatal tract at follow-up: lower fractional anisotropy (p=0.069), higher axial diffusivity (p=0.020), and higher radial diffusivity (p=0.0077). A one-unit change in the radial diffusivity index corresponded with a 15.0 increase in raw score points on initiation, 30.3 on planning, and 28.0 on working memory (p<0.05 for all). INTERPRETATION: Acute leukoencephalopathy during chemotherapy treatment, without cranial radiation, for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia predicted higher risk for long-term neurobehavioural problems and reduced white matter integrity in frontal brain regions. Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia might benefit from preventive cognitive or behavioural interventions, particularly those who develop acute leukoencephalopathy.

So far little is known about SBDS exact function. SDS patients present several hematological disorders, including neutropenia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with increased risk of leukemic evolution. So far, the molecular mechanisms that underlie neutropenia, MDS and AML in SDS patients have been poorly investigated. STAT3 is a key regulator of several cellular processes including survival, differentiation and malignant transformation. Moreover, STAT3 has been reported to regulate neutrophil granulogenesis and to induce several kinds of leukemia and lymphoma. STAT3 activation is known to be regulated by mTOR, which in turn plays an important role in cellular growth and tumorigenesis. Here we show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that both EBV-immortalized B cells and primary leukocytes obtained from SDS patients present a constitutive hyper-activation of mTOR and STAT3 pathways. Interestingly, loss of SBDS expression is associated with this process. Importantly, rapamycin, a well-known mTOR inhibitor, is able to reduce STAT3 phosphorylation to basal levels in our experimental model. A novel therapeutic hypothesis targeting mTOR/STAT3 should represent a significant step forward into the SDS clinical practice.","['Bezzerri, Valentino', 'Vella, Antonio', 'Calcaterra, Elisa', 'Finotti, Alessia', 'Gasparello, Jessica', 'Gambari, Roberto', 'Assael, Baroukh Maurice', 'Cipolli, Marco', 'Sorio, Claudio']","['Bezzerri V', 'Vella A', 'Calcaterra E', 'Finotti A', 'Gasparello J', 'Gambari R', 'Assael BM', 'Cipolli M', 'Sorio C']","['Department of Medicine, Unit of General Pathology, University of Verona, Italy.', 'Regional Shwachman-Diamond Centre, Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Unit of General Pathology, University of Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Pulmonology, Adult CF center, IRCCS Fondazione Ca granda Policlinico Milano, Italy.', 'Regional Shwachman-Diamond Centre, Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Unit of General Pathology, University of Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5034238,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['srep33165 [pii]', '10.1038/srep33165 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 23;6:33165. doi: 10.1038/srep33165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism for chemoresistance by hypoxia is not fully understood. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on resistance to two therapies, methotrexate (MTX) and prednisolone (PRD), in two cell models for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To look for an implication of hypoxia in chemoresistance, cell viability, total cell density and cell proliferation were analyzed. Survival and death signaling pathways were also screened by ""reverse phase protein array"" (RPPA) and western blotting experiments conducted on selected proteins to confirm the results. RESULTS: We found that hypoxia promotes chemoresistance in both ALL cell lines. The induction of drug-resistance by hypoxia was not associated with an increase in total cell density nor an increase in cell proliferation. Using RPPA, we show that chemoresistance induced by hypoxia was mediated through an alteration of cell death signaling pathways. This protective effect of hypoxia seems to occur via a decrease in pro-apoptotic proteins and an increase in anti-apoptotic proteins. The results were confirmed by immunoblotting. Indeed, hypoxia is able to modulate the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins independently of chemotherapy while a pro-apoptotic signal induced by a chemotherapy is not modulated by hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia is a factor in leukemia cell resistance and for two conventional chemotherapies modulates cell death signaling pathways without affecting total cell density or cell proliferation.","['Petit, C', 'Gouel, F', 'Dubus, I', 'Heuclin, C', 'Roget, K', 'Vannier, J P']","['Petit C', 'Gouel F', 'Dubus I', 'Heuclin C', 'Roget K', 'Vannier JP']","['MERCI EA3829, Universite de Rouen, Faculte de Medecine-Pharmacie, 22 Boulevard Gambetta, 76183, Rouen, France.', 'BioSIMS Technologies, 75 Route de Lyons la foret, Seine BioPolis, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'MERCI EA3829, Universite de Rouen, Faculte de Medecine-Pharmacie, 22 Boulevard Gambetta, 76183, Rouen, France.', 'MERCI EA3829, Universite de Rouen, Faculte de Medecine-Pharmacie, 22 Boulevard Gambetta, 76183, Rouen, France.', 'BioSIMS Technologies, 75 Route de Lyons la foret, Seine BioPolis, 76000, Rouen, France.', 'Enterome, 94/96 avenue Ledru-Rollin, 75011, Paris, France.', 'MERCI EA3829, Universite de Rouen, Faculte de Medecine-Pharmacie, 22 Boulevard Gambetta, 76183, Rouen, France. jean-pierre.vannier@univ-rouen.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160922,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC5034444,,2016/09/24 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2776-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2776-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 22;16(1):746. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2776-1.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Chemoresistance', '*Hypoxia', '*Methotrexate', '*Prednisolone', '*RPPA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies show that autophagy is involved in phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells. However, contribution of autophagy to phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells by macrophages is not clearly defined. Here, we assessed cytoprotective effect of autophagy on clearance of the apoptotic cells. Apoptosis of murine splenic lymphocytes and human T-cell leukemia cells was induced with cyclophosphamide. After engulfment of the apoptotic cells, expression of Belin-1 and LC3 in macrophages was upregulated, the number of MDC-positive vesicles, LC3-positive autophagosomes and autophagic ultrastructures increased significantly. Autophagosome was fused with phagosome containing fragments of the nuclei or other debris of the apoptotic cells to form amphisome. Some cells in macrophages phagocytosing the apoptotic cells became apoptotic. After autophagy of macrophages was inhibited with 3-MA, viability and survival of macrophages reduced, phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells by macrophages deceased significantly. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an important role in promoting clearance of the apoptotic cells by protecting macrophages from apoptosis during phagocytosis as well as degrading the contents of phagosomes via amphisome formation.","['Zhou, Pei', 'Tan, Yu-Zhen', 'Wang, Hai-Jie', 'Li, Ting', 'He, Tao', 'Yu, Ying', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Zhang, Dan']","['Zhou P', 'Tan YZ', 'Wang HJ', 'Li T', 'He T', 'Yu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang D']","['Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Shanghai Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Shanghai Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Shanghai Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.

The structure of 1 was elucidated by spectroscopic analyses and NMR calculation, and a plausible biogenetic pathway for zephycandidine A (1) was proposed. Zephycandidine A (1) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against five cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 1.98 to 7.03 muM with selectivity indices as high as 10 when compared to the normal Beas-2B cell. Further studies suggested that zephycandidine A (1) induces apoptosis in leukemia cells by the activation of caspase-3, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and degradation of PARP expression. In addition, zephycandidine A (1) showed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, and the docking studies of zephycandidine A (1) and galanthamine (2) with AChE revealed that interactions with W286 and Y337 are necessary.","['Zhan, Guanqun', 'Qu, Xiaolan', 'Liu, Junjun', 'Tong, Qingyi', 'Zhou, Junfei', 'Sun, Bin', 'Yao, Guangmin']","['Zhan G', 'Qu X', 'Liu J', 'Tong Q', 'Zhou J', 'Sun B', 'Yao G']","[""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Taishan Medical University, Tai-An 271016, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,PMC5034291,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['srep33990 [pii]', '10.1038/srep33990 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 23;6:33990. doi: 10.1038/srep33990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, new therapeutic strategies which could selectively target LSCs in clinical leukemia treatment and avoid drug resistance are urgently needed. However, only a few small molecules have been reported to show anti-LSCs activity. METHODS: The aim of the present study was to identify alantolactone as novel agent that can ablate acute myeloid leukemia stem and progenitor cells from AML patient specimens and evaluate the anticancer activity of alantolactone in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The present study is the first to demonstrate that alantolactone, a prominent eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactone, could specifically ablate LSCs from AML patient specimens. Furthermore, in comparison to the conventional chemotherapy drug, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), alantolactone showed superior effects of leukemia cytotoxicity while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Alantolactone induced apoptosis with a dose-dependent manner by suppression of NF-kB and its downstream target proteins. DMA-alantolactone, a water-soluble prodrug of alantolactone, could suppress tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we propose that alantolactone may represent a novel LSCs-targeted therapy and eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactones offer a new scaffold for drug discovery towards anti-LSCs agents.","['Ding, Yahui', 'Gao, Huier', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Li, Ye', 'Vasdev, Neil', 'Gao, Yingdai', 'Chen, Yue', 'Zhang, Quan']","['Ding Y', 'Gao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Vasdev N', 'Gao Y', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Haihe Education Park, 38 Tongyan Road, Tianjin, 300353, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Haihe Education Park, 38 Tongyan Road, Tianjin, 300353, People's Republic of China."", 'Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Gordon Center for Medical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, 02114, MA, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Haihe Education Park, 38 Tongyan Road, Tianjin, 300353, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Haihe Education Park, 38 Tongyan Road, Tianjin, 300353, People's Republic of China. zhangquan612@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160922,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,,PMC5034521,,2016/09/24 06:00,2016/09/24 06:01,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0327-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0327-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 22;9(1):93. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0327-5.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia stem cells', 'Alantolactone', 'Apoptosis', 'KG1a']",,,,,,,['J Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 15;14(1):61.

It belongs to a family of cytokines which use the glycoprotein 130 chain for signal transduction, such as oncostatin M or leukemia inhibitory factor. Targeting interleukin-6 in plasma cell diseases is currently evaluated in clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies. Here, efforts were made to elucidate the contribution of interleukin-6 and glycoprotein 130 signaling in malignant plasma cell growth in vivo In the xenograft severe combined immune deficiency model employing our interleukin-6-dependent plasma cell line INA-6, the lack of human interleukin-6 induced autocrine interleukin-6 production and a proliferative response to other cytokines of the glycoprotein 130 family. Herein, mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies against human interleukin-6 (elsilimomab/B-E8), the interleukin-6 receptor (B-R6), and with an antibody blocking glycoprotein 130 (B-R3). While treatment of mice with interleukin-6 and interleukin-6 receptor antibodies resulted in a modest delay in tumor growth, the development of plasmacytomas was completely prevented with the anti-glycoprotein 130 antibody. Importantly, complete inhibition was also achieved using F(ab')2-fragments of monoclonal antibody B-R3. Tumors harbor activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and in vitro, the antibody inhibited leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and cell growth, while being less effective against interleukin-6. In conclusion, the growth of INA-6 plasmacytomas in vivo under interleukin-6 withdrawal remains strictly dependent on glycoprotein 130, and other glycoprotein 130 cytokines may substitute for interleukin-6. Antibodies against glycoprotein 130 are able to overcome this redundancy and should be explored for a possible therapeutic window.","['Burger, Renate', 'Gunther, Andreas', 'Klausz, Katja', 'Staudinger, Matthias', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Penas, Eva Maria Murga', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Wijdenes, John', 'Gramatzki, Martin']","['Burger R', 'Gunther A', 'Klausz K', 'Staudinger M', 'Peipp M', 'Penas EM', 'Rose-John S', 'Wijdenes J', 'Gramatzki M']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany r.burger@med2.uni-kiel.de.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Gen-Probe/Diaclone SAS, Besancon, France.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Department of Internal Medicine II, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160922,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5286946,,2016/09/24 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/09/24 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.145060 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.145060 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Feb;102(2):381-390. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.145060.

While its effects in later stages of T cell differentiation are well recognized, the role of GATA3 in the generation of early T cell precursors (ETP) has only recently been explored. As aberrant GATA3 mRNA expression has been linked to cancerogenesis, we investigated the role of GATA3 in early T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). METHODS: We analyzed GATA3 mRNA expression by RT-PCR (n = 182) in adult patients with T-ALL. Of these, we identified 70 of 182 patients with ETP-ALL by immunophenotyping. DNA methylation was assessed genome wide (Illumina Infinium(R) HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform) in 12 patients and GATA3-specifically by pyrosequencing in 70 patients with ETP-ALL. The mutational landscape of ETP-ALL with respect to GATA3 expression was investigated in 18 patients and validated by Sanger sequencing in 65 patients with ETP-ALL. Gene expression profiles (Affymetrix Human genome U133 Plus 2.0) of an independent cohort of adult T-ALL (n = 83) were used to identify ETP-ALL and investigate GATA3(low) and GATA3(high) expressing T-ALL patients. In addition, the ETP-ALL cell line PER-117 was investigated for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, GATA3 mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and global gene expression before and after treatment with decitabine. RESULTS: In our cohort of 70 ETP-ALL patients, 33 % (23/70) lacked GATA3 expression and were thus defined as GATA3(low). DNA methylation analysis revealed a high degree of GATA3 CpG island methylation in GATA3(low) compared with GATA3(high) ETP-ALL patients (mean 46 vs. 21 %, p < 0.0001). Genome-wide expression profiling of GATA3(low) ETP-ALL exhibited enrichment of myeloid/lymphoid progenitor (MLP) and granulocyte/monocyte progenitor (GMP) genes, while T cell-specific signatures were downregulated compared to GATA3(high) ETP-ALL. Among others, FLT3 expression was upregulated and mutational analyses demonstrated a high rate (79 %) of FLT3 mutations.

It is not clear whether the splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS) is also associated with treatment failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all CML patients who had BCR-ABL1 kinase mutation analysis performed between August 1, 2007, and January 15, 2014. Patients who had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected had their medical records reviewed to determine response to TKI therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty four patients had kinase mutation testing performed; of these, 64 patients (23%) had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected. Forty-five patients were in chronic phase (70%), 10 were in accelerated phase (16%), 6 were in blastic phase (9%), and 3 were in other settings (5%). Of the 34 chronic phase patients who began therapy with imatinib, 23 patients (68%) failed therapy: 8 patients (24%) had primary refractory disease, 11 patients (32%) progressed, and 4 patients (12%) had disease progression after dose interruption. In contrast to the patients with disease progression or lack of response, none of 23 patients who were responding to imatinib had BCR-ABL1(35INS) detected. DNA sequencing of commonly mutated spliceosomal genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, SFA31, PRPF408, U2A565, and SF1 did not reveal mutations in seven BCR-ABL1(35INS) -positive patients tested. CONCLUSIONS: The splice variant BCR-ABL1(35INS) is frequently found in patients who are resistant to imatinib. Mutations in the commonly mutated spliceosomal proteins do not contribute to this association.","['Berman, Ellin', 'Jhanwar, Suresh', 'Hedvat, Cyrus', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Wahab, Omar Abdel-', 'Levine, Ross', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Ma, Wanlong', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Berman E', 'Jhanwar S', 'Hedvat C', 'Arcila ME', 'Wahab OA', 'Levine R', 'Maloy M', 'Ma W', 'Albitar M']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, USA.

Gold standard for dissecting clonal heterogeneity are single-cell analyses. Here, we present an efficient workflow based on an advanced Single-Cell Printer (SCP) device for the study of gene variants in single cancer cells. To allow for precise cell deposition into microwells the SCP was equipped with an automatic dispenser offset compensation, and the 384-microwell plates were electrostatically neutralized. The ejection efficiency was 99.7% for fluorescent beads (n = 2304) and 98.7% for human cells (U-2 OS or Kasumi-1 cancer cell line, acute myeloid leukemia [AML] patient; n = 150). Per fluorescence microscopy, 98.8% of beads were correctly delivered into the wells. A subset of single cells (n = 81) was subjected to whole genome amplification (WGA), which was successful in all cells. On empty droplets, a PCR on LINE1 retrotransposons yielded no product after WGA, verifying the absence of free-floating DNA in SCP-generated droplets. Representative gene variants identified in bulk specimens were sequenced in single-cell WGA DNA. In U-2 OS, 22 of 25 cells yielded results for both an SLC34A2 and TET2 mutation site, including cells harboring the SLC34A2 but not the TET2 mutation. In one cell, the TET2 mutation analysis was inconclusive due to allelic dropout, as assessed via polymorphisms located close to the mutation. Of Kasumi-1, 23 of 33 cells with data on both the KIT and TP53 mutation site harbored both mutations. In the AML patient, 21 of 23 cells were informative for a TP53 polymorphism; the identified alleles matched the loss of chromosome arm 17p. The advanced SCP allows efficient, precise and gentle isolation of individual cells for subsequent WGA and routine PCR/sequencing-based analyses of gene variants. This makes single-cell information readily accessible to a wide range of applications and can provide insights into clonal heterogeneity that were indeterminable solely by analyses of bulk specimens.","['Riba, Julian', 'Renz, Nathalie', 'Niemoller, Christoph', 'Bleul, Sabine', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Stosch, Juliane M', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Koltay, Peter', 'Zengerle, Roland', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Zimmermann, Stefan', 'Becker, Heiko']","['Riba J', 'Renz N', 'Niemoller C', 'Bleul S', 'Pfeifer D', 'Stosch JM', 'Metzeler KH', 'Hackanson B', 'Lubbert M', 'Duyster J', 'Koltay P', 'Zengerle R', 'Claus R', 'Zimmermann S', 'Becker H']","['Laboratory for MEMS Applications, Department of Microsystems Engineering - IMTEK, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for MEMS Applications, Department of Microsystems Engineering - IMTEK, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for MEMS Applications, Department of Microsystems Engineering - IMTEK, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hahn-Schickard Society for Applied Research, Freiburg, Germany.', 'BIOSS - Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for MEMS Applications, Department of Microsystems Engineering - IMTEK, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160922,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,,PMC5033393,"['PK and RZ are founders and scientific advisory board members of the cytena GmbH,', 'which develops single-cell analysis and handling solutions.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this anticancer effect remains poorly understood. We recently found that ivermectin markedly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells by stimulating cytostatic macroautophagy/autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Ivermectin inhibits the AKT-MTOR signaling pathway by promoting ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1), leading to increased autophagic flux. Together, our work unravels the molecular mechanism underpinning ivermectin-induced cytostatic autophagy in breast cancer, and characterizes ivermectin as a potential therapeutic option for breast cancer treatment.","['Wang, Kui', 'Gao, Wei', 'Dou, Qianhui', 'Chen, Haining', 'Li, Qifu', 'Nice, Edouard C', 'Huang, Canhua']","['Wang K', 'Gao W', 'Dou Q', 'Chen H', 'Li Q', 'Nice EC', 'Huang C']","['a State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy , Chengdu , China.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy , Chengdu , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Tropical Diseases and Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education and Department of Neurology , Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College , Haikou , China.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy , Chengdu , China.', 'c Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery , West China Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Tropical Diseases and Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education and Department of Neurology , Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College , Haikou , China.', 'd Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Monash University, Clayton , Victoria , Australia.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy , Chengdu , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Tropical Diseases and Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education and Department of Neurology , Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical College , Haikou , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160922,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,"['Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Cytostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ivermectin/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'p21-Activated Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC5173258,,2016/09/23 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2016.1231494 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2016 Dec;12(12):2498-2499. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2016.1231494.

However, the frequency of this occurrence, the kinetics, and the identity of mobilized endogenous proviruses was unclear. Here we find that these mobilized transcripts are detected after only one day of infection. They predominate over recombinant polytropic viruses early in infection, persist throughout the course of disease and are comprised of multiple different polytropic proviruses. Other endogenous retroviral elements such as intracisternal A particles (IAPs) were not detected. The integration of the endogenous transcripts into new cells could result in loss of transcriptional control and elevated expression which may facilitate pathogenesis, perhaps by contributing to the generation of polytropic recombinant viruses.","['Boi, Stefano', 'Rosenke, Kyle', 'Hansen, Ethan', 'Hendrick, Duncan', 'Malik, Frank', 'Evans, Leonard H']","['Boi S', 'Rosenke K', 'Hansen E', 'Hendrick D', 'Malik F', 'Evans LH']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160919,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Microbial Interactions', 'Proviruses/physiology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Tropism', '*Virus Activation']",PMC5102782,,2016/09/23 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 2016 Dec;499:136-143. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.009.

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of GClb compared to RClb, Clb, and ofatumumab plus chlorambucil (OClb) in The Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb, RClb, Clb and other treatments in the United Kingdom. A country adaptation was made to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these therapies in The Netherlands using Dutch unit costs and Dutch data sources for background mortality and post-progression survival. RESULTS: An incremental gain of 1.06 and 0.64 QALYs was estimated for GClb compared to Clb and RClb respectively, at additional costs of euro23,208 and euro7254 per patient. Corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro21,823 and euro11,344 per QALY. Indirect treatment comparisons showed an incremental gain varying from 0.44 to 0.77 QALYs for GClb compared to OClb and additional costs varying from euro7041 to euro5028 per patient. The ICER varied from euro6556 to euro16,180 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: GClb appeared to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared to RClb, OClb and Clb.","['Blommestein, Hedwig M', 'de Groot, Saskia', 'Aarts, Mieke J', 'Vemer, Pepijn', 'de Vries, Robin', 'van Abeelen, Annet F M', 'Posthuma, E F M Ward', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin A']","['Blommestein HM', 'de Groot S', 'Aarts MJ', 'Vemer P', 'de Vries R', 'van Abeelen AF', 'Posthuma EF', 'Uyl-de Groot CA']","['Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Institute of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Netherlands Cancer Registry Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Whether this new therapeutic scenario will modify the current prevalence statistics and natural history of autoimmune cytopenias complicating CLL is still a matter of debate. Here we present a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic, with special emphasis on the incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The potential to induce autoimmune cytopenia has been studied mostly with ibrutinib, a first- in-class bruton kinase (BTK) inhibitor, licensed for the treatment of relapsed/refractory high-risk CLL. Recent observations suggest that emergent AIHA occurring during therapy with ibrutinib is more an expression of CLL activity than an ibrutinib-mediated process. Since available information on AIHA occurring during and after therapy with small-molecule kinase inhibitors relies mainly on data collected from clinical trials, a close post- marketing surveillance is mandatory in order to improve our understanding of this topic.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Molica S', 'Polliack A']","['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.

Posttreatment prognostic factors are increasingly being evaluated. METHODS: Among 280 younger patients who were treated with intermediate-dose cytarabine (total >/= 5 g/m(2) ) and idarubicin-based induction chemotherapy and achieved remission, 186 were assessed for minimal residual disease (MRD) with an 8-color multiparameter flow cytometry panel performed on bone marrow specimens with a sensitivity of 0.1% or higher. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients had samples available 1 to 2 months after induction at the time of complete remission (CR), and 79% became negative for MRD, with an MRD-negative status associated with an improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .0002) and overall survival (OS; P = .0002). One hundred sixteen were evaluated for their MRD status during consolidation, and 86% were negative, with an MRD-negative status associated with a significant improvement in RFS (P < .0001) and OS (P < .0001). Sixty-nine patients were evaluated for their MRD status after completion of all therapy, and 84% were negative, with an MRD-negative status associated with an improvement in RFS (P < .0001) and OS (P < .0001). In a multivariate analysis including age, cytogenetics, response (CR vs CR with incomplete platelet recovery/incomplete blood count recovery), and MRD, achieving an MRD-negative status was the most important independent predictor of RFS and OS at response (P = .008 and P = .0008, respectively), during consolidation (P < .0001 for both), and at the completion of therapy (P < .0001 and P = .002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving an MRD-negative status according to multiparameter flow cytometry is associated with a highly significant improvement in the outcomes of younger patients with AML receiving cytosine arabinoside plus idarubicin-based induction and consolidation regimens.

This agent has been shown to exhibit broad off-target kinase inhibition and immunomodulating properties. These effects may be responsible for dasatinib's unique side effects including a distinctive form of hemorrhagic colitis. We report a case of hemorrhagic colitis associated with dasatinib use in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Colon biopsies at the time of symptomatic colitis confirmed CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltration. The process rapidly resolved following drug discontinuation, but relapsed when rechallenged with a reduced dose of dasatinib. Colitis did not recur when the patient was treated with an alternative agent. A literature review of prior cases involving dasatinib-induced T-cell mediated colitis provides insight into commonalities that may facilitate the recognition and management of this entity. Most incidences occurred after a 3-month drug exposure and may be accompanied by large granular lymphocytes. The process uniformly resolves within a few days following drug discontinuation and will generally recur in a shorter period of time if the drug is reintroduced. Most patients will require an alternative agent, although select patients could be continued on dasatinib if other options are limited.","['Shanshal, Mohamed', 'Shakespeare, Andrew', 'Thirumala, Seshadri', 'Fenton, Boyd', 'Quick, Donald P']","['Shanshal M', 'Shakespeare A', 'Thirumala S', 'Fenton B', 'Quick DP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Tech University School of Medicine, Lubbock, Tex., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20160923,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Colitis/chemically induced', '*Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/chemically induced', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', '*Pyrimidines', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thiazoles']",,,2016/09/23 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['000448983 [pii]', '10.1159/000448983 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(4):219-228. doi: 10.1159/000448983.

Human AML cell lines HL-60 and U937 were adhesion cocultured with human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 cells. Such coculturing induced HL-60 and U937 cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs including daunorubicin (DNR), homoharringtonine (HHT), and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). The coculturing-induced resistance of AML cells to DNR, HHT, and Ara-C can be partially reversed by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Clinically, AML patients with a low level of PTEN and a high level of CCND1 had high relapse rates within 1 year, and newly diagnosed AML patients with extramedullary infiltration had a low level of PTEN. This study confirms the involvement of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in multidrug resistance in AML cells induced by stroma and suggests that the expression of PTEN and CCND1 may be a prognostic indicator for AML.","['Chen, Ping', 'Jin, Qing', 'Fu, Qiang', 'You, Peidong', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Yuan, Qin', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Chen P', 'Jin Q', 'Fu Q', 'You P', 'Jiang X', 'Yuan Q', 'Huang H']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian, P.R.

Here we used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape at relapse in pediatric ALL cases. These analyses identified numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in chemotherapy resistance-related protein complexes. In this context, RAS-MAPK pathway-activating mutations in the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) genes were present in 24 of 55 (44%) cases in our series. Interestingly, some leukemias showed retention or emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, whereas in others RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild-type populations, supporting a role for both positive and negative selection evolutionary pressures in clonal evolution of RAS-mutant leukemia. Consistently, functional dissection of mouse and human wild-type and mutant RAS isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance but also improved the response to vincristine in mutant RAS-expressing lymphoblasts. These results highlight the central role of chemotherapy-driven selection as a central mechanism of leukemia clonal evolution in relapsed ALL, and demonstrate a previously unrecognized dual role of RAS mutations as drivers of both sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy.","['Oshima, Koichi', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'da Silva-Almeida, Ana C', 'Tzoneva, Gannie', 'Abate, Francesco', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Sanchez-Martin, Marta', 'Carpenter, Zachary', 'Penson, Alex', 'Perez-Garcia, Arianne', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Nicolas, Concepcion', 'Balbin, Milagros', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate', 'Palomero, Teresa', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Oshima K', 'Khiabanian H', 'da Silva-Almeida AC', 'Tzoneva G', 'Abate F', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Sanchez-Martin M', 'Carpenter Z', 'Penson A', 'Perez-Garcia A', 'Eckert C', 'Nicolas C', 'Balbin M', 'Sulis ML', 'Kato M', 'Koh K', 'Paganin M', 'Basso G', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Devidas M', 'Loh ML', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R', 'Palomero T', 'Rabadan R', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;

Cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells differentiate after a brief preactivation with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 and exhibit enhanced responses to cytokine or activating receptor restimulation for weeks to months after preactivation. We hypothesized that memory-like NK cells exhibit enhanced antileukemia functionality. We demonstrated that human memory-like NK cells have enhanced interferon-gamma production and cytotoxicity against leukemia cell lines or primary human AML blasts in vitro. Using mass cytometry, we found that memory-like NK cell functional responses were triggered against primary AML blasts, regardless of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) to KIR-ligand interactions. In addition, multidimensional analyses identified distinct phenotypes of control and memory-like NK cells from the same individuals. Human memory-like NK cells xenografted into mice substantially reduced AML burden in vivo and improved overall survival. In the context of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, adoptively transferred memory-like NK cells proliferated and expanded in AML patients and demonstrated robust responses against leukemia targets. Clinical responses were observed in five of nine evaluable patients, including four complete remissions. Thus, harnessing cytokine-induced memory-like NK cell responses represents a promising translational immunotherapy approach for patients with AML.","['Romee, Rizwan', 'Rosario, Maximillian', 'Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Wagner, Julia A', 'Jewell, Brea A', 'Schappe, Timothy', 'Leong, Jeffrey W', 'Abdel-Latif, Sara', 'Schneider, Stephanie E', 'Willey, Sarah', 'Neal, Carly C', 'Yu, Liyang', 'Oh, Stephen T', 'Lee, Yi-Shan', 'Mulder, Arend', 'Claas, Frans', 'Cooper, Megan A', 'Fehniger, Todd A']","['Romee R', 'Rosario M', 'Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Wagner JA', 'Jewell BA', 'Schappe T', 'Leong JW', 'Abdel-Latif S', 'Schneider SE', 'Willey S', 'Neal CC', 'Yu L', 'Oh ST', 'Lee YS', 'Mulder A', 'Claas F', 'Cooper MA', 'Fehniger TA']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.

Murine leukemia virus (MLV) replication was significantly restricted by gamma-IFN, but not human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Because MLV enters host cells via endosomes, we speculated that certain cellular factors among gamma-IFN-induced, endosome-localized proteins inhibit MLV replication. We found that gamma-IFN-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase (GILT) significantly restricts HIV-1 replication as well as MLV replication by its thiolreductase activity. GILT silencing enhanced replication-defective HIV-1 vector infection and virion production in gamma-IFN-treated cells, although gamma-IFN did not inhibit HIV-1 replication. This result showed that GILT is required for the anti-viral activity of gamma-IFN. Interestingly, GILT protein level was increased by gamma-IFN in uninfected cells and env-deleted HIV-1-infected cells, but not in full-length HIV-1-infected cells. gamma-IFN-induced transcription from the gamma-IFN-activation sequence was attenuated by the HIV-1 Env protein. These results suggested that the gamma-IFN cannot restrict HIV-1 replication due to the inhibition of gamma-IFN signaling by HIV-1 Env. Finally, we found that 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS), which inhibits S-S bond formation at acidic pH, significantly suppresses HIV-1 vector infection and virion production, like GILT. In conclusion, this study showed that GILT functions as a host restriction factor against the retroviruses, and a GILT mimic, 4-PDS, is the leading compound for the development of novel concept of anti-viral agents.","['Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Izumida, Mai', 'Yashima, Yuka', 'Yoshii-Kamiyama, Haruka', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Yasui, Kiyoshi', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Matsuyama, Toshifumi']","['Kubo Y', 'Izumida M', 'Yashima Y', 'Yoshii-Kamiyama H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Yasui K', 'Hayashi H', 'Matsuyama T']","['Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, G-COE, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, G-COE, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Cytokine Signaling, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Present address: Department of Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Dithionitrobenzoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, env/physiology', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors/*physiology', 'Tetraspanin 30/physiology', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",PMC5342076,,2016/09/23 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['12104 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12104 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 1;7(44):71255-71273. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12104.,,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9BZQ3U62JX (Dithionitrobenzoic Acid)', 'EC 1.8.- (IFI30 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antiviral', 'endosome', 'gamma-interferon', 'retroviruses', 'thiolreductase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smyd2 is over-expressed in several cancer types and was shown to be limiting for tumor development in the pancreas. However, genetic evidence for a role of Smyd2 in other cancers or in mouse development was missing to date. Using germ line-deleted mouse strains, we now show that Smyd2 and the related protein Smyd3 are dispensable for normal development. Ablation of Smyd2 did not affect hematopoiesis, but retarded the development of leukemia promoted by MLL-AF9, a fusion oncogene associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in humans. Smyd2-deleted leukemic cells showed a competitive disadvantage relative to wild-type cells, either in vitro or in vivo. The Smyd2 gene was directly activated by the oncogenic transcription factor Myc in either MLL9-AF9-induced leukemias, Myc-induced lymphomas, or fibroblasts. However, unlike leukemias, the development of lymphomas was not dependent upon Smyd2. Our data indicate that Smyd2 has a critical role downstream of Myc in AML.","['Bagislar, Sevgi', 'Sabo, Arianna', 'Kress, Theresia R', 'Doni, Mirko', 'Nicoli, Paola', 'Campaner, Stefano', 'Amati, Bruno']","['Bagislar S', 'Sabo A', 'Kress TR', 'Doni M', 'Nicoli P', 'Campaner S', 'Amati B']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT at SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT at SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT at SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT at SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",PMC5341809,,2016/09/24 06:00,2018/02/10 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['12012 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12012 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 11;7(41):66398-66415. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12012.,,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Smyd2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL-AF9', 'Smyd2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'c-Myc', 'lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of p53 function in CLL cells due to chromosome 17p deletion or p53 mutations often leads to a more malignant disease phenotype and is associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. Thus, development of novel therapeutic strategies to effectively target CLL cells with p53 deficiency is clinically important. Here we showed that p53-null CLL cells were highly sensitive to ROS-mediated cell killing due to their intrinsic ROS stress. We further demonstrated that a natural compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) was able to effectively kill CLL cells with loss of p53, even under the protection of stromal cells. In p53-defficient CLL cells, PEITC induced a rapid depletion of glutathione and a severe accumulation of ROS, leading to massive leukemia cell death in the stromal microenvironment. The drug-induced cell death was associated with a significant decrease of in MCL-1 survival molecule. We further showed that ROS-mediated cell death was the key mechanism by which PEITC induced cytotoxicity, since such cell death could be prevented by addition of antioxidant NAC. Importantly, in vivo study showed that PEITC was able to induce substantial leukemia cell death in mice. Treatment of CLL mice harboring TCL1-Tg:p53-/- genotype with PEITC significantly prolonged the median survival time of the animals. Our study identifies a vulnerability of p53-null CLL cells with high sensitivity to ROS-generating agents, and suggests that PEITC may potentially be useful for clinical treatment of CLL with 17p deletion and p53 mutations.","['Liu, Jinyun', 'Chen, Gang', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Liao, Jianwei', 'Huang, Jie', 'Feng, Li', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Liu J', 'Chen G', 'Pelicano H', 'Liao J', 'Huang J', 'Feng L', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC5342085,,2016/09/23 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['12110 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12110 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 1;7(44):71378-71389. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12110.,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'PEITC', 'oxidative stress', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-CLL is characterized by significant immune suppression and dysregulation but this is not typical of patients with SLL. Natural killer cells (NK) are important mediators of immune function but have been poorly studied in patients with B-CLL/SLL. Here we report for the first time the NK cell phenotype and function in patients with B-CLL and SLL alongside their transcriptional profile. We show for the first time impaired B-CLL NK cell function in a xenograft model with reduced activating receptor expression including NKG2D, DNAM-1 and NCRs in-vitro. Importantly, we show these functional differences are associated with transcriptional downregulation of cytotoxic pathway genes, including activating receptors, adhesion molecules, cytotoxic molecules and intracellular signalling molecules, which remain intact in patients with SLL. In conclusion, NK cell function is markedly influenced by the anatomical site of the tumor in patients with B-CLL/SLL and lymphocytosis leads to marked impairment of NK cell activity. These observations have implications for treatment protocols which seek to preserve immune function by limiting the exposure of NK cells to tumor cells within the peripheral circulation.","['Parry, Helen M', 'Stevens, Tom', 'Oldreive, Ceri', 'Zadran, Bassier', 'McSkeane, Tina', 'Rudzki, Zbigniew', 'Paneesha, Shankara', 'Chadwick, Caroline', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Zuo, Jianmin', 'Moss, Paul']","['Parry HM', 'Stevens T', 'Oldreive C', 'Zadran B', 'McSkeane T', 'Rudzki Z', 'Paneesha S', 'Chadwick C', 'Stankovic T', 'Pratt G', 'Zuo J', 'Moss P']","['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Science, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Science, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, B9 5SS, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, B9 5SS, UK.', 'Biomedical Services Unit, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Science, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, B9 5SS, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",PMC5356570,,2016/09/23 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['12097 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12097 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 18;7(42):68513-68526. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12097.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NK cells', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'immunomodulation', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 35 children who had newly-diagnosed ALL and achieved complete remission on day 33 of remission induction therapy were retrospectively reviewed. The children before treatment were considered as the incipient group, and those who achieved complete remission on day 33 were considered as the remission group. Fifteen children with non-malignant hematologic diseases were enrolled as the control group. RT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of Wif-1 and beta-catenin. ELISA was used to measure the protein expression of Wif-1. RESULTS: Compared with the control and remission groups, the incipient group had significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of Wif-1 and significantly higher mRNA expression of beta-catenin (P<0.05). In the incipient and remission groups, high-risk children showed significantly higher mRNA expression of beta-catenin and significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of Wif-1 than the medium- and low-risk children (P<0.05). In the incipient and remission group, the children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed significantly higher mRNA expression of beta-catenin and significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of Wif-1 compared with those with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P<0.05).

Even though an MRI examination could better demonstrate the disease in cases of suspected female genital tract involvement by ALL, the comparison of differences between a present and a previous CT examination is sufficient to suspect the diagnosis.","['Mazzei, M A', 'Bettini, G', 'Pozzessere, C', 'Guerrini, S', 'Defina, M', 'Ambrosio, M R', 'Aprile, L', 'Bocchia, M', 'Volterrani, L']","['Mazzei MA', 'Bettini G', 'Pozzessere C', 'Guerrini S', 'Defina M', 'Ambrosio MR', 'Aprile L', 'Bocchia M', 'Volterrani L']","['Department of Medical, Surgical and Neuro Sciences, Diagnostic Imaging, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Neuro Sciences, Diagnostic Imaging, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Neuro Sciences, Diagnostic Imaging, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Neuro Sciences, Diagnostic Imaging, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplants, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies, Section of Pathology, Azienda Ospedaliera, Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplants, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplants, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Neuro Sciences, Diagnostic Imaging, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnostic imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Uterus/*diagnostic imaging']",,,2016/09/23 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['37 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2016 Jul-Sep;30(3):871-875.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Porhyromonas gingivalis (P. g) is widely recognized as a major pathogen in the development and progression of periodontitis. Here we compared the differential effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from P. g and E. coli on the expression and production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) by human MCs. Human LAD2 MCs were stimulated with LPS from either P. g or E. coli (1-1000 ng/ml). MCs were also stimulated with SP (2muM) serving as the positive control or media alone as the negative control. After 24 h, the cells and supernatant fluids were collected and analyzed for beta-Hexosaminidase (beta-hex) spectrophotometrically, TNF, VEGF and MCP-1 release by ELISA and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mediator gene expression, respectively. To assess the functional role of tolllike receptors (TRL) in mediator release, MCs were pre-incubated with either anti-TLR2 or anti- TLR4 (2 mug/ml) polyclonal antibody for 1 h before stimulation with LPS. When MCs were stimulated with SP (2 muM), there was a statistically significant beta-hex release as well as release of TNF, VEGF and MCP-1. Stimulation of MCs with either type of LPS did not induce degranulation based on the lack of beta-hex release. However, both types of LPS stimulated expression and release of TNF, VEGF and MCP-1. Although, P. g LPS induced significant release of TNF, VEGF and MCP-1, the effect was not concentration-dependent. There was no statistically significant difference between the effects of P. g and E. coli LPS. P. g LPS stimulated TNF through TLR-2 while E. coli utilized TRL-4 instead. In contrast, VEGF release by P. g LPS required both TRL-2 and TRL-4 while E. coli LPS required TLR-4. Release of MCP-1 was independent of TLR-2 or TLR-4. P. g LPS activates human MCs to generate and release TNF, VEGF and MCP-1 through different TLRs than E. coli LPS. MCs may, therefore, be involved in the inflammatory processes responsible for periodontal disease.","['Palaska, I', 'Gagari, E', 'Theoharides, T C']","['Palaska I', 'Gagari E', 'Theoharides TC']","['Molecular Immunopharmacology and Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Oral Medicine Clinics, A.

Heme, hemin and their degradation products possess significant immunomodulatory functions. Here, we studied whether hemin regulates inflammasome function in macrophages. Both hemin and its derivative, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), significantly reduced IL-1beta secretion by cultured human primary macrophages, the human monocytic leukemia cell line and also mouse bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages. Intraperitoneal administration of CoPP to mice prior to urate crystal-induced peritonitis alleviated IL-1beta secretion to the peritoneal cavity. In cultured macrophages, hemin and CoPP inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by reducing the amount of intracellular apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC). The reduction of ASC was associated with enhanced autophagosome formation and autophagic flux. Inhibition of autophagy prevented the CoPP-induced depletion of ASC, implying that the depletion was caused by increased autophagy. Our data indicate that hemin functions as an endogenous negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inhibition is mediated via enhanced autophagy that results in increased degradation of ASC. This regulatory mechanism may provide a novel approach for the treatment of inflammasome-related diseases.","['Nurmi, Katariina', 'Kareinen, Ilona', 'Virkanen, Juhani', 'Rajamaki, Kristiina', 'Kouri, Vesa-Petteri', 'Vaali, Kirsi', 'Levonen, Anna-Liisa', 'Fyhrquist, Nanna', 'Matikainen, Sampsa', 'Kovanen, Petri T', 'Eklund, Kari K']","['Nurmi K', 'Kareinen I', 'Virkanen J', 'Rajamaki K', 'Kouri VP', 'Vaali K', 'Levonen AL', 'Fyhrquist N', 'Matikainen S', 'Kovanen PT', 'Eklund KK']","['Wihuri Research Institute, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160922,Switzerland,J Innate Immun,Journal of innate immunity,101469471,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Hemin/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Inflammasomes/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/metabolism', 'Peritonitis/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Protoporphyrins/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Uric Acid']",PMC6738905,,2016/09/23 06:00,2017/10/19 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2015/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['000448894 [pii]', '10.1159/000448894 [doi]']",ppublish,J Innate Immun. 2017;9(1):65-82. doi: 10.1159/000448894.

To evaluate safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity of PR1 vaccination, a phase I/II trial was conducted. Sixty-six HLA-A2+ patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML: 42), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML: 13) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS: 11) received three to six PR1 peptide vaccinations, administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks at dose levels of 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg. Patients were randomized to the three dose levels after establishing the safety of the highest dose level. Primary end points were safety and immune response, assessed by doubling of PR1/HLA-A2 tetramer-specific CTL, and the secondary end point was clinical response. Immune responses were noted in 35 of 66 (53%) patients. Of the 53 evaluable patients with active disease, 12 (24%) had objective clinical responses (complete: 8; partial: 1 and hematological improvement: 3). PR1-specific immune response was seen in 9 of 25 clinical responders versus 3 of 28 clinical non-responders (P=0.03).

Bowtie2 and MACS2 were used for the mapping and peak calling of the ChIP-Seq data respectively. ChIPseeker, a R bioconductor package was adopted for the annotation of the enriched peaks. For the gene expression profiles, we used affy and limma package to do normalization and differential expression analysis. The genes with fold change >2 and adjusted P-Value <0.05 were screened out. Besides, BETA (Binding and Expression Target Analysis) was used to do the combined analysis of ChIP-Seq and gene expression profiles. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used for the functional enrichment analysis of overlapping genes between the target genes and differential expression genes (DEGs). What's more, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the overlapping genes was obtained through the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). A total of 46,487 peaks were identified for GATA3 and out of which, 3256 ones were found to located at -3000 ~ 0 bp from the transcription start sites (TSS) of their nearby gene. A total of 236 down- and 343 up-regulated genes were screened out in GATA3 overexpression breast cancer samples compared with those in control. The combined analysis of ChIP-Seq and gene expression dataset showed GATA3 act as a repressor in breast cancer. Besides, 68 overlaps were obtained between the DEGs and genes included in peaks located at -3000 ~ 0 bp from TSS. Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to cancer progression and gene regulation were found to be enriched in those overlaps. In the PPI network, NDRG1, JUP and etc. were found to directly interact with large number of genes, which might indicate their important roles in the progression of breast cancer.","['Liu, Pengfei', 'Jiang, Wenhua', 'Zhou, Shiyong', 'Gao, Jun', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Liu P', 'Jiang W', 'Zhou S', 'Gao J', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center of Lymphoma and Leukemia, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Huan-Hu-Xi Road, Ti-Yuan-Bei, He Xi District, Tianjin, 300060, China."", 'Department of Radiotherapy, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center of Lymphoma and Leukemia, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Huan-Hu-Xi Road, Ti-Yuan-Bei, He Xi District, Tianjin, 300060, China."", 'Department of Oncology, Hengshui Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui, Hebei, 053000, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center of Lymphoma and Leukemia, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Huan-Hu-Xi Road, Ti-Yuan-Bei, He Xi District, Tianjin, 300060, China. snowlpf@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160921,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Protein Interaction Maps/genetics', 'Transcriptome/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,2016/09/23 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/09/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-016-0116-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-016-0116-z [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2017 Apr;23(2):361-368. doi: 10.1007/s12253-016-0116-z.

Lymphoma is a term for a variety of lymphatic system malignancies. Autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative malignancies share a complex bidirectional relationship. A causal relationship between inflammatory mypathies and lymphoma has not been established. The diagnosis/treatment of inflammatory myopathy usually precedes the detection/diagnosis of lymphoma. Immune system dysregulation presumably underlies the evolution of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory myopathies. Inflammatory activity with chronic B-cell activation and/or antigen stimulation is deemed the major risk factor for lymphoma in patients with autoimmunity. A ""paraneoplastic"" phenomenon or the effects of immunosuppressive therapy may be alternative immune-based mechanisms.

METHODS: The cohort of mine and mill workers was created using data from Canada's National Dose Registry and the Ontario Mining Master File. The follow-up for the cohort was recently extended for mortality (1954-2007) and for the first time includes cancer incidence (1969-2005). The Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and excess relative risks (ERR) and their 95% CIs with levels of cumulative radon exposure. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 28 546 male miners with a mean cumulative radon exposure of 21.0 working level months (WLM). An increased risk of lung cancer and a dose-response relationship was observed with cumulative radon exposure. Miners exposed to >100 WLM demonstrated a twofold increase in the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR=1.89, CI 1.43 to 2.50) compared with the non-exposed group, and a linear ERR of 0.64/100 WLM (CI 0.43 to 0.85), with similar results observed for mortality.

Several reports have suggested that this pathway also participates in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) pathogenesis. To get a better insight into the role of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in CLL we analysed in detail the expression of the most overexpressed Wnt ligand, encoded by the WNT3 gene, in a well-defined cohort of 137 CLL patients. Our analysis demonstrated that (i) untreated patients with more aggressive disease (with a notable exception of patients with 11q deletion) express less WNT3, (ii) WNT3 declines with disease progression in a significant proportion of patients and (iii) low WNT3 was identified as a strong independent marker indicating shorter treatment-free survival in CLL patients with IGHV mutation. Interestingly, CLL-related lymphoid cell lines, but not stromal cells, failed to respond to the ligand-induced activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. This opens the possibility that CLL cells use Wnt-3 to communicate with the cells in the microenvironment. We thus propose that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a more complex role in CLL pathogenesis than previously anticipated.","['Poppova, Lucie', 'Janovska, Pavlina', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Plesingerova, Hana', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Kotaskova, Jana', 'Kantorova, Barbara', 'Hlozkova, Michaela', 'Figulova, Jana', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Machalova, Michaela', 'Urik, Milan', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Kozubik, Alois', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Bryja, Vitezslav']","['Poppova L', 'Janovska P', 'Plevova K', 'Radova L', 'Plesingerova H', 'Borsky M', 'Kotaskova J', 'Kantorova B', 'Hlozkova M', 'Figulova J', 'Brychtova Y', 'Machalova M', 'Urik M', 'Doubek M', 'Kozubik A', 'Pospisilova S', 'Pavlova S', 'Bryja V']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'CEITEC -

There are some reports about the leukemogenic effects related to low-level exposure to benzene. OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NB), and nuclear budding (NBUD) in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of petrochemical workers with low level exposure to benzene. METHODS: We enrolled 50 workers exposed to low-level benzene and 31 unexposed workers of a petrochemical industry. After exclusion of 3 samples, peripheral blood lymphocytes of the remaining 47 exposed and 31 unexposed workers were analyzed for the frequency of MN, NB, and NBUD by cytochalasin-blocked MN technique. RESULTS: MN was present in 28 (60%) exposed and 18 (58%) unexposed workers. NB was observed in 6 (13%), and 2 (7%) exposed and unexposed workers, respectively; the frequency for NBUD was 20 (43%), and 13 (42%), respectively. No significant difference was found in the observed frequencies of MN, NB, and NBUD in the peripheral blood lymphocytes between the exposed and unexposed group workers. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to low-level benzene does not increase the frequency of MN, NB, and NBUD in the peripheral blood lymphocytes, biomarkers for DNA damage.","['Jamebozorgi, I', 'Mahjoubi, F', 'Pouryaghoub, G', 'Mehrdad, R', 'Majidzadeh, T', 'Saltanatpour, Z', 'Nasiri, F']","['Jamebozorgi I', 'Mahjoubi F', 'Pouryaghoub G', 'Mehrdad R', 'Majidzadeh T', 'Saltanatpour Z', 'Nasiri F']","['Occupational Medicine Department, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Center for Research on Occupational Diseases (CROD), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. pourya@tums.ac.ir.', 'Center for Research on Occupational Diseases (CROD), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cytogenetic Department, Iran Blood Transfusion Organization Research Centre (IBTO), Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Occup Environ Med,The international journal of occupational and environmental medicine,101535763,IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chemical Industry', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Oil and Gas Industry']",PMC6817958,,2016/09/22 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['785 [pii]', '10.15171/ijoem.2016.785 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Occup Environ Med. 2016 Oct;7(4):227-33. doi: 10.15171/ijoem.2016.785.,,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Benzene', '*Cell nucleus', '*Cytoplasm', '*DNA damage', '*Leukemia', '*Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also discuss the clinical development of promising agents including gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Complete response has been observed among patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) when treated with GSIs. Furthermore, a recent study has suggested that targeting Zmiz1, a direct, selective cofactor of Notch1, rather than targeting Notch directly, maybe helpful to reduce the current target-related toxicities.

Although outcomes of patients who have undergone HCT and require care in intensive care units (ICUs) have improved over time, mortality rates remain high and there are significant associated costs. Lack of a team-based approach to care, especially during critical illness, is detrimental to patient autonomy and satisfaction, and to team morale, ultimately leading to poor quality of care. In this manuscript, we describe the case of a patient who had undergone HCT and was in the ICU setting, where inconsistent team interaction among the various stakeholders delivering care resulted in a lack of shared goals and poor outcomes. Team cognition is cognitive processing at the team level through interactions among team members and is reflected in dynamic communication and coordination behaviors. Although the patient received multidisciplinary care as needed in a medically complicated case, a lack of team cognition and, particularly, inconsistent communication among the dynamic teams caring for the patient, led to mixed messages being delivered with high-cost implications for the health-care system and the family. This article highlights concepts and recommendations that begin a necessary in-depth assessment of implications for clinical care and initiate a research agenda that examines the effects of team cognition on HCT teams, and, more generally, critical care of the patient with cancer.","['McNeese, Nathan J', 'Khera, Nandita', 'Wordingham, Sara E', 'Arring, Noel', 'Nyquist, Sharon', 'Gentry, Amy', 'Tomlinson, Brian', 'Cooke, Nancy J', 'Sen, Ayan']","['McNeese NJ', 'Khera N', 'Wordingham SE', 'Arring N', 'Nyquist S', 'Gentry A', 'Tomlinson B', 'Cooke NJ', 'Sen A']","['Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.', 'Arizona State University, Mesa; Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ; and CancerCare, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160930,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,IM,"['Communication', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Care Team/*organization & administration', 'Patient Satisfaction']",,,2016/09/22 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['JOP.2016.013672 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2016.013672 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2016 Nov;12(11):1091-1099. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.013672.

We aimed to better define the very recent epidemiology and outcome of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in a real-life setting. We prospectively collected all consecutive febrile/infectious episodes occurring in AL patients admitted to 9 haematology units. In 293 AL patients, 433 BSIs were diagnosed. Gram-positive (GP) bacteria were isolated in 44.8 % BSI and Gram-negative (GN) in 38.3 %, while polymicrobial aetiology- or fungi-related events were identified in 15.7 and 1.1 % of the cases, respectively. GP was observed more frequently in patients not in complete remission (p = 0.04), while GN during consolidation cycles (p = 0.003). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains accounted for 23.2 % of enterobacteria. They were associated with previous antibiotic exposure, including fluoroquinolones prophylaxis (p = 0.01). Carbapenem-resistant (CR) strains occurred in 9 % of enterobacteria. Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 21.6 % were multiresistant. Overall 30-day mortality was 8.5 %.

CBL0137 has demonstrated antitumor effects in animal models of several adult cancers and neuroblastoma. PROCEDURES: CBL0137 was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro cell line panel at concentrations ranging from 1.0 nM to 10.0 muM and against the PPTP in vivo solid tumor xenograft and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) panels at 50 mg/kg administered intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The median relative IC50 (rIC50 ) value for the PPTP cell lines was 0.28 muM (range: 0.13-0.80 muM). There were no significant differences in rIC50 values by histotype. CBL0137 induced significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) distribution compared to control in 10 of 31 (32%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts and in eight of eight (100%) evaluable ALL xenografts. Significance differences in EFS distribution were observed in four of six osteosarcoma lines, three of three rhabdoid tumor lines and two of six rhabdomyosarcoma lines. No objective responses were observed among the solid tumor xenografts. For the ALL panel, one xenograft achieved complete response and four achieved partial response. CONCLUSIONS: The most consistent in vivo activity for CBL0137 was observed against ALL xenografts, with some solid tumor xenograft lines showing tumor growth delay. It will be important to relate the drug levels in mice at 50 mg/kg to those in humans at the recommended phase 2 dose.","['Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Maris, John M', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Purmal, Andrei', 'Gudkov, Andrei', 'Kurmashev, Dias', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Maris JM', 'Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Keir ST', 'Wu J', 'Purmal A', 'Gudkov A', 'Kurmashev D', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware.', ""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", 'Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', 'Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Incuron LLC, Buffalo, New York.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160921,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5587189,,2016/09/22 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26263 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Apr;64(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26263.

Nevertheless, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. First, we used primary leukemia patient samples to identify an ETV6/RUNX1 specific expression signature consisting of 596 lncRNA transcripts. Next, integration of this lncRNA signature with RNA sequencing of BCP-ALL cell lines and lncRNA profiling of an in vitro model system of ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown, revealed that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are truly regulated by the oncogenic fusion protein. Moreover, sustained inactivation of lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cells caused profound changes in gene expression. All together, our study defined a unique lncRNA expression signature associated with ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL and identified lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 as lncRNAs that might be functionally implicated in the biology of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.","['Ghazavi, Farzaneh', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Van Loocke, Wouter', 'Wallaert, Annelynn', 'Helsmoortel, Hetty H', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Bakkus, Marleen', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Van Nieuwerburgh, Filip', 'Deforce, Dieter', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Lammens, Tim', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Ghazavi F', 'De Moerloose B', 'Van Loocke W', 'Wallaert A', 'Helsmoortel HH', 'Ferster A', 'Bakkus M', 'Plat G', 'Delabesse E', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Van Nieuwerburgh F', 'Deforce D', 'Van Roy N', 'Speleman F', 'Benoit Y', 'Lammens T', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, HUDERF, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Toulouse, France."", 'Department of Hematology, Institut Universitaire de Cancerologie de Toulouse, University Toulouse-III Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Pharmaceutics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Pharmaceutics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Paediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Transcriptome']",PMC5342012,,2016/09/22 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['12063 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12063 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):73769-73780. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12063.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCP-ALL', 'ETV6/RUNX1', 'lncRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since p53 affects mitochondrial function and integrity, we examined possible mitochondrial changes in CLL mice with TCL1-Tg/p53(-/-) and TCL1-Tg/p53(+/+) genotypes and in primary leukemia cells from CLL patients with or without 17p-deletion. Although the expression of mitochondrial COX1, ND2, and ND6 decreased in p53(-/-)CLL cells, there was an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis as evidenced by higher mitochondrial mass and mtDNA copy number associated with an elevated expression of TFAM and PGC-1alpha. Surprisingly, the overall mitochondrial respiratory activity and maximum reserved capacity increased in p53(-/-) CLL cells.

The full impact of socioeconomic variables on outcomes in this minority population is not entirely understood. PROCEDURE: Disease characteristics, demographic, and socioeconomic status (SES) variables were collected on black (n = 44) and white (n = 178) patients diagnosed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the influence of SES and insurance status on survival. RESULTS: As a cohort, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 87% (82-91%), with a median follow-up of 99 months. In univariable analysis, black race was not significantly associated with a higher risk of death or relapse and death. White and black patients with standard-risk leukemia had excellent outcomes, with 97% (91-99%) and 96% (75-99%) 5-year OS, respectively. In contrast, for high-risk disease, white patients had a statistically significant improved 5-year OS rates compared with black patients (79% [68-87%] vs. 52% [28-72%]). Black children were more likely to have public insurance, and, in multivariable analysis, this was associated with a trend toward an improved outcome. Black patients also had poorer census tract-level SES parameters, but these variables were not associated with survival. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates significantly inferior outcomes for black children with high-risk leukemia. These outcome disparities were not related to SES variables, including poverty or private insurance coverage, suggesting the involvement of other factors and highlighting the need for a prospective investigative analysis.","['Walsh, Alexandra', 'Chewning, Joseph', 'Li, Xuelin', 'Dai, Chen', 'Whelan, Kimberly', 'Madan-Swain, Avi', 'Waterbor, John', 'Baskin, Monica L', 'Goldman, Frederick D']","['Walsh A', 'Chewning J', 'Li X', 'Dai C', 'Whelan K', 'Madan-Swain A', 'Waterbor J', 'Baskin ML', 'Goldman FD']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Specialty Center of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama School of Public Health, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama School of Public Health, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160921,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",,,2016/09/22 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26222 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Feb;64(2):267-274. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26222.

CML cells (K562) treated with 1muM imatinib (24-96 h) were further assessed for the expression of central lipid-related genes by real-time PCR. HMGCoAR, LDL-R, and apobec1 expressions were significantly increased while CETP declined after 48-96 h. To conclude, imatinib produces an independent favorable lipid profile, which is not hindered by statins and is partly mediated via transcription regulation of genes involved in the clearance of plasma lipids.","['Ellis, Martin', 'Krashin, Eilon', 'Hamburger-Avnery, Orly', 'Gan, Sarah', 'Elis, Avishai', 'Ashur-Fabian, Osnat']","['Ellis M', 'Krashin E', 'Hamburger-Avnery O', 'Gan S', 'Elis A', 'Ashur-Fabian O']","['a Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory , Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center , Kfar-Saba , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'c Department of Internal Medicine A , Meir Medical Center , Kfar-Saba , Israel.', 'a Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory , Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center , Kfar-Saba , Israel.', 'a Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory , Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center , Kfar-Saba , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'd Department of Internal Medicine C , Beilinson Campus, Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva , Israel.', 'a Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory , Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Meir Medical Center , Kfar-Saba , Israel.', 'e The Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160921,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects/genetics', 'Lipids/blood', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/22 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/09/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1228928 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 May;58(5):1172-1177. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1228928.

Here, we evaluated the utility of UNC2025, a MERTK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for treatment of acute leukemia.Experimental Design: Preclinical in vitro and in vivo assays using cell lines and primary leukemia patient samples were used to evaluate antileukemic effects of UNC2025.Results: UNC2025 potently inhibited prosurvival signaling, induced apoptosis, and reduced proliferation and colony formation in MERTK-expressing ALL and AML cell lines and patient samples. Approximately 30% of primary leukemia patient samples (78 of 261 total) were sensitive to UNC2025. Sensitive samples were most prevalent in the AML, T-ALL, and minimally differentiated (M0) AML subsets. UNC2025 inhibited MERTK in bone marrow leukemia cells and had significant therapeutic effects in xenograft models, with dose-dependent decreases in tumor burden and consistent two-fold increases in median survival, irrespective of starting disease burden. In a patient-derived AML xenograft model, treatment with UNC2025 induced disease regression. In addition, UNC2025 increased sensitivity to methotrexate in vivo, suggesting that addition of MERTK-targeted therapy to current cytotoxic regimens may be particularly effective and/or allow for chemotherapy dose reduction.Conclusions: The broad-spectrum activity mediated by UNC2025 in leukemia patient samples and xenograft models, alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, supports continued development of MERTK inhibitors for treatment of leukemia.

Here, we derived rabbit ES-like (rES-like) cells from blastocysts of superovulated Japanese white rabbits using culture medium containing 10(-7) M melatonin, 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, and 1,000 IU/mL human leukemia inhibitory factor. This concentration of melatonin had the most significant positive effects on the proliferation inner cell mass-derived cells (improving rates from 19.97% to 34.57%) and the longevity of passaging rES-like cells. Melatonin also enhanced the expression of pluripotent genes-including alkaline phosphatase, Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, Line28a, and surface marker proteins-in fifth-passage rES-like cells. In vitro, these rES-like cells could spontaneously differentiate into some somatic cells, such as beating cardiomyocytes; formed embryoid bodies; expressed markers of the three germ layers after differentiation; and formed teratomas after injection into non-obese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Thus, melatonin helped coax ES-like cells from rabbit blastocysts, which raises intriguing questions about the relationship between pluripotency and proliferation in rabbit embryonic stem cells. Mol.

An association between genetic variants in MTX transport genes and toxicity has been found. It is known that these transporters are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), and miRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interfere with miRNA levels or function. With regard to B-cell ALL, we have previously found rs56103835 in miR-323b that targets ABCC4 associated with MTX plasma levels. Despite these evidences and that nowadays a large amount of new miRNAs have been annotated, studies of miRNA polymorphisms and MTX toxicity are almost absent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether there are other variants in miRNAs associated with MTX levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of 167 Spanish patients with pediatric B-cell ALL treated with the LAL-SHOP protocol were analyzed. We selected all the SNPs described in pre-miRNAs with a minor allele frequency more than 1% (213 SNPs in 206 miRNAs) that could regulate MTX transporters because the miRNAs that target MTX transporter genes are not completely defined. Genotyping was performed with VeraCode GoldenGate platform. RESULTS: Among the most significant results, we found rs56292801 in miR-5189, rs4909237 in miR-595, and rs78790512 in miR-6083 to be associated with MTX plasma levels. These miRNAs were predicted, in silico, to regulate genes involved in MTX uptake: SLC46A1, SLC19A1, and SLCO1A2. CONCLUSION: In this study, we detected three SNPs in miR-5189, miR-595, and miR-6083 that might affect SLC46A1, SLC19A1, and SLCO1A2 MTX transport gene regulation and could affect MTX levels in patients with pediatric B-cell ALL.","['Iparraguirre, Leire', 'Gutierrez-Camino, Angela', 'Umerez, Maitane', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Astigarraga, Itziar', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Sastre, Ana', 'Garcia de Andoin, Nagore', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Iparraguirre L', 'Gutierrez-Camino A', 'Umerez M', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Astigarraga I', 'Navajas A', 'Sastre A', 'Garcia de Andoin N', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['aDepartment of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa bDepartment of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao cDepartment of Pediatrics, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo dDepartment of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid eDepartment of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Organic Anion Transporters/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter/genetics', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain', 'Whites/genetics']",,,2016/10/18 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000245 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2016 Nov;26(11):517-525. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000245.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC46A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLCO1A2 protein, human)', '0 (microRNA595 microRNA, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After red blood cell transfusion, Hgb values rose (9.0 g/dL) and there was a complete reversion of the dyspnea. Yet, subsequent arterial blood gas analysis, without the administration of supplemental oxygen, systematically revealed very low oxygen saturation values (~ 46%), which was inconsistent with the patientas clinical state and his pulse oximetry values (~ 87%), and these values were not corrected by the administration of oxygen via non-rebreather mask.

In this study, we evaluated these additional hTERT non-telomeric functions. We determined that hTERT interacts with several 19S and 20S proteasome subunits. The 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle are part of 26S proteasome complex, which plays a central role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. In addition, hTERT positively regulated 26S proteasome activity independent of its enzymatic activity. Moreover, hTERT enhanced subunit interactions, which may underlie hTERT's ability of hTERT to stimulate the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, hTERT displayed cytoprotective effect against ER stress via the activation of 26S proteasome in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Our data suggest that hTERT acts as a novel chaperone to promote 26S proteasome assembly and maintenance. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2083-2093, 2017.

These rarely occur together in the same patient. A Caucasian 72-year-old male was treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with chemotherapy including daunorubicin and cytarabine. Within 48 hours of commencing treatment, he developed pyrexia and, two days later, disseminated non-tender pink plaques on the limbs and trunk. A skin biopsy showed a dermal interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytoid cells and predominantly neutrophils. This extended into the subcutis, where a neutrophilic lobular panniculitis was seen. These findings are consistent with Sweet's syndrome. In addition, a neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate was also present around eccrine coils and lower ducts. The eccrine epithelium showed squamous metaplasia with dyskeratosis and sloughing into the lumen. These latter findings are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH). These two histologically distinct entities form part of the neutrophilic dermatoses that have been described in oncology patients with reports of concurrent or sequential occurrence of various neutrophilic dermatoses in the same patient. Ours, however, is only the second reported case of simultaneously captured Sweet's and NEH in the setting of AML. The most likely explanation is that of an epiphenomenon, whereby the neutrophilic infiltrate extended around the sweat glands in the context of the neutrophilic dermatosis.","['Wlodek, Christina', 'Bhatt, Nidhi', 'Kennedy, Cameron']","['Wlodek C', 'Bhatt N', 'Kennedy C']","['Department of Dermatology, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Dermatology, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160731,Austria,Dermatol Pract Concept,Dermatology practical & conceptual,101585990,,,PMC5006554,,2016/09/21 06:00,2016/09/21 06:01,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5826/dpc.0603a11 [doi]', 'dp0603a11 [pii]']",epublish,Dermatol Pract Concept. 2016 Jul 31;6(3):55-7. doi: 10.5826/dpc.0603a11. eCollection 2016 Jul.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Sweet's syndrome"", 'neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis', 'neuturopilic dermatosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 125 patients with Stage I/II seminoma treated with PORT at the Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service between 1992 and 2013. Patients were linked to the Victorian Cancer Registry to enable confirmation of survival and diagnosis of secondary malignancies (SM). The relapse-free survival (RFS), testicular-cancer-specific survival (TCSS), overall survival (OS) and SM-free survival (SMFS) were estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 36 (range 20-62). The median time between diagnosis and PORT was 1.6 months (range: 0.5-4.5). Fifty patients (40%) had PORT to the para-aortic (PA) target alone, while the remaining had PORT to PA and ipsilateral or bilateral iliac lymph nodes. There were no acute adverse effects requiring admission. The median follow-up after PORT was 7.8 years (range = 0.1-19.1). There were two relapses, both of which occurred within 1 year of PORT (estimated 10-year RFS = 98.4%). Five deaths were reported, none of which were testicular cancer-related death (estimated 10-year TCSS = 100%, 10-year OS = 97.3%). There were seven SM (one lower lip cancer, one upper shoulder melanoma, one mesothelioma, two prostate cancer, one acute myeloid leukaemia and one contralateral testicular seminoma) reported in six patients, with estimated 10-year SMFS of 92.9%. CONCLUSION: Our series confirms excellent oncological outcomes among patients with Stage I/II seminoma treated with PORT, with uncommon occurrence of SM.","['Ong, Wee Loon', 'Nazareth, Lester', 'Hindson, Benjamin', 'Matheson, Bronwyn', 'Millar, Jeremy L']","['Ong WL', 'Nazareth L', 'Hindson B', 'Matheson B', 'Millar JL']","['Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service Prahran Victoria Australia; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.', 'Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service Prahran Victoria Australia.', 'Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service Prahran Victoria Australia.', 'Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service Prahran Victoria Australia.', 'Alfred Health Radiation Oncology Service Prahran Victoria Australia; Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine Monash University Melbourne Victoria Australia.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20160405,United States,J Med Radiat Sci,Journal of medical radiation sciences,101620352,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Postoperative Period', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Seminoma/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5016619,,2016/09/21 06:00,2018/06/02 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/jmrs.170 [doi]', 'JMRS170 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Radiat Sci. 2016 Sep;63(3):161-9. doi: 10.1002/jmrs.170.

The children with ALL are treated with methotrexate (MTX) based chemotherapy protocols. MTX causes unpredictable serious hepatic and renal side effects. Silymarin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and stimulates tissue regeneration. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of Silymarin on MTX-based chemotherapy-induced Hepatic and renal toxicity in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 80 children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group I included 40 children with ages ranging from 4-13 years and the mean age of 6.85+/- 2.89 years, who received Silymarin 420 mg/day in 3 divided doses for one week after each MTX dose. Group II included 40 children, with ages ranging from 4-12 years and the mean age of 7.30+/-2.6 years, who received placebo for one week after MTX therapy. For all patients liver functions including serum bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, globulin and albumin-globulin ratio, alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST, prothrombin time and activity and renal functions including blood urea and serum creatinine, serum cystatin C and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase were done to assess hepatic and renal toxicity before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between group I and II as regard liver and renal functions before chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, there were significantly higher values of ALT and AST and alkaline phosphatase, and significantly lower Prothrombin activity in group II compared with group I. No significant differences between group I and II were found in total bilirubin, serum protein, and albumin levels. There was significantly lower blood urea, serum creatinine, and cystatin C and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in group I compared with group II. CONCLUSION: Silymarin improved some hepatic and renal functions in children with ALL who received MTX-based chemotherapy protocols. RECOMMENDATIONS: Extensive multicenter studies could be recommended to prove the hepatic and renal protective effects of Silymarin in patients with ALL who received MTX-based chemotherapy protocols.","['Hagag, Adel A', 'Elgamsy, Mohamed A', 'El-Asy, Hassan M', 'Mabrouk, Maaly M']","['Hagag AA', 'Elgamsy MA', 'El-Asy HM', 'Mabrouk MM']","['Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University.', 'Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160901,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC5016017,,2016/09/21 06:00,2016/09/21 06:01,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2016.043 [doi]', 'mjhid-8-1-e2016043 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2016 Sep 1;8(1):e2016043. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2016.043. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assist clinicians in its early detection, we systematically reviewed all existing data on its clinical presentation and estimated the frequency of signs and symptoms presenting at or prior to diagnosis. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for all studies describing presenting features of leukaemia in children (0-18 years) without date or language restriction, and, when appropriate, meta-analysed data from the included studies. RESULTS: We screened 12 303 abstracts for eligibility and included 33 studies (n=3084) in the analysis. All were cohort studies without control groups. 95 presenting signs and symptoms were identified and ranked according to frequency. Five features were present in >50% of children: hepatomegaly (64%), splenomegaly (61%), pallor (54%), fever (53%) and bruising (52%). An additional eight features were present in a third to a half of children: recurrent infections (49%), fatigue (46%), limb pain (43%), hepatosplenomegaly (42%), bruising/petechiae (42%), lymphadenopathy (41%), bleeding tendency (38%) and rash (35%). 6% of children were asymptomatic on diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Over 50% of children with leukaemia have palpable livers, palpable spleens, pallor, fever or bruising on diagnosis. Abdominal symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain and abdominal distension are common. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as limp and joint pain also feature prominently. Children with unexplained illness require a thorough history and focused clinical examination, which should include abdominal palpation, palpation for lymphadenopathy and careful scrutiny of the skin. Occurrence of multiple symptoms and signs should alert clinicians to possible leukaemia.","['Clarke, Rachel T', 'Van den Bruel, Ann', 'Bankhead, Clare', 'Mitchell, Christopher D', 'Phillips, Bob', 'Thompson, Matthew J']","['Clarke RT', 'Van den Bruel A', 'Bankhead C', 'Mitchell CD', 'Phillips B', 'Thompson MJ']","['Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Children's Hospital, John Radcliffe, Oxford, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contusions/etiology', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Exanthema/etiology', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/complications/*diagnosis', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Diseases/etiology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology']",,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['archdischild-2016-311251 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2016-311251 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2016 Oct;101(10):894-901. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2016-311251.,"['G0800472/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'PDF-2014-07-072/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4938-9673'],"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We studied the induction of adaptive immunity to neonatal infection with a murine retrovirus, under conditions leading to immunological tolerance. We found that the absence of either maternal or offspring adaptive immunity permitted efficient vertical transmission of the retrovirus. Maternal immunodeficiency allowed the retrovirus to induce central Th cell tolerance in the infected offspring. In turn, this compromised the offspring's ability to mount a protective Th cell-dependent B cell response. However, in contrast to T cells, offspring B cells were not centrally tolerized and retained their ability to respond to the infection when provided with T cell help. Thus, escape of retrovirus-specific B cells from deletional tolerance offers the opportunity to induce protective retroviral immunity by restoration of retrovirus-specific T cell help, suggesting similar T cell immunotherapies for persistent viral infections.","['Mavrommatis, Bettina', 'Baudino, Lucie', 'Levy, Prisca', 'Merkenschlager, Julia', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Donnarumma, Tiziano', 'Young, George', 'Stoye, Jonathan', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Mavrommatis B', 'Baudino L', 'Levy P', 'Merkenschlager J', 'Eksmond U', 'Donnarumma T', 'Young G', 'Stoye J', 'Kassiotis G']","['Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; george.kassiotis@crick.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160919,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Tolerance', 'Female', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*prevention & control/transmission']",PMC5073355,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1600734 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1600734 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Nov 1;197(9):3628-3638. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600734.

We also performed subgroup analyses based on the classification of leukemias. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association. RESULTS: A total of 19 publications comprising 1,509 cases and 4,075 controls were selected in the study. An association between the risk of leukemia and the LT-alpha +252 AA genotype was found (GG + AG vs. AA, OR = 0.485, 95% CI 0.368-0.639, p = 0.000).

METHODS: To set up immune POF model, fifty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control (mice consumed normal water, n = 10), hydrogen (mice consumed hydrogen-rich water, n = 10), model (mice were immunized with zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 [ZP3] and consumed normal water, n = 15), and model-hydrogen (mice were immunized with ZP3 and consumed hydrogen-rich water, n = 15) groups. After 5 weeks, mice were sacrificed. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, granulosa cell (GC) apoptotic index (AI), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) expression were examined. Analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. RESULTS: Immune POF model, model group exhibited markedly reduced serum AMH levels compared with those of the control group (5.41 +/- 0.91 ng/ml vs. 16.23 +/- 1.97 ng/ml, P = 0.033) and the hydrogen group (19.65 +/- 7.82 ng/ml, P = 0.006). The model-hydrogen group displayed significantly higher AMH concentrations compared with that of the model group (15.03 +/- 2.75 ng/ml vs. 5.41 +/- 0.91 ng/ml, P = 0.021). The GC AI was significantly higher in the model group (21.30 +/- 1.74%) than those in the control (7.06 +/- 0.27%), hydrogen (5.17 +/- 0.41%), and model-hydrogen groups (11.24 +/- 0.58%) (all P < 0.001). The GC AI was significantly higher in the model-hydrogen group compared with that of the hydrogen group (11.24 +/- 0.58% vs. 5.17 +/- 0.41%, P = 0.021). Compared with those of the model group, ovarian tissue Bcl-2 levels increased (2.18 +/- 0.30 vs. 3.01 +/- 0.33, P = 0.045) and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased in the model-hydrogen group. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen-rich water may improve serum AMH levels and reduce ovarian GC apoptosis in a mouse immune POF model induced by ZP3.","['He, Xin', 'Wang, Shu-Yu', 'Yin, Cheng-Hong', 'Wang, Tong', 'Jia, Chan-Wei', 'Ma, Yan-Min']","['He X', 'Wang SY', 'Yin CH', 'Wang T', 'Jia CW', 'Ma YM']","['Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.', 'Reproductive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100026, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/blood', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cells/cytology', 'Hydrogen/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovarian Reserve/*drug effects/physiology', 'Ovary/drug effects/metabolism', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/blood/*metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Water/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Zona Pellucida/drug effects/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC5040020,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2016_129_19_2331_190668 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.190668 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2016 Oct 5;129(19):2331-7. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.190668.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotaxonomically remarkable, 5,8'-coupled naphthylisoquinolines have as yet been found quite rarely in Asian Ancistrocladus species, where only two examples have so far been detected, while alkaloids with this coupling type represent the by far the largest group of constituents in African taxa. Ancistectorine D (5) shows promising activities against the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, and it was likewise found to display strong cytotoxic activities against human leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and multidrug-resistant tumor cells (CEM/ADR5000).","['Bringmann, Gerhard', 'Seupel, Raina', 'Feineis, Doris', 'Zhang, Guoliang', 'Xu, Minjuan', 'Wu, Jun', 'Kaiser, Marcel', 'Brun, Reto', 'Seo, Ean-Jeong', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Bringmann G', 'Seupel R', 'Feineis D', 'Zhang G', 'Xu M', 'Wu J', 'Kaiser M', 'Brun R', 'Seo EJ', 'Efferth T']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.

A diagnosis of MS is established using pathologic features including infiltration of myeloblasts and strong myeloperoxidase expression with negative cytokeratin immunohistochemical staining. We report a rare case of colonic MS without any peripheral blood abnormality. If the affected patient were left untreated, the MS could evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) within one year. Several studies recommend the same regimens of chemotherapy as used for circulating AML to treat isolated MS. We focused on the diagnosis of MS in this study.

Combination immunochemotherapy such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab is the standard first line therapy in fit patients, but there is limited evidence regarding the optimal treatment of patients after relapse. Ofatumumab as monotherapy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of relapsed, refractory CLL, and as it is not myelotoxic, it is an ideal drug to combine with chemotherapy. However, the optimal dose of ofatumumab in this setting is not known. The Chemotherapy plus Ofatumumab at Standard or Mega dose in relapsed CLL (COSMIC) trial will assess the efficacy and safety of standard and high (mega) doses of ofatumumab combined with bendamustine or a combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to determine which, if either, schedule should progress to a phase III trial. METHODS/DESIGN: COSMIC is a phase II, multi-centre, randomised, open, parallel group trial for patients with relapsed CLL who are not refractory to fludarabine-based chemotherapy. Participants will be randomised to receive either standard dose or mega dose ofatumumab. Both doses will be given in combination with either bendamustine or fludarabine and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy backbone. The primary objective is to assess the proportion of participants achieving a complete remission following therapy with the two treatment arms (mega versus standard), as assessed at 3 months post treatment. The treatment groups will be assessed independently to determine whether the level of response is acceptable in relation to pre-specified criteria. If both treatment groups show an acceptable level of response, selection criteria will be used to determine which to take forward to a confirmatory phase III trial. A key secondary objective is to assess the dynamics of minimal residual disease (MRD) levels in relapsed disease. Eighty-two participants are planned to be recruited from 18 research centres in the UK. DISCUSSION: Currently there is limited evidence regarding the optimal treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, and so suitable therapies are urgently needed. The COSMIC trial will identify whether ofatumumab given in combination with chemotherapy is safe and effective in this population, and will identify the optimal doses for further investigation.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard treatments for CML, but a number of patients fail to respond effectively due to gene mutations. Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been shown to have anti-tumor effect on solid tumor whereas the anti-CML effect and its underlying mechanism have not been completely elucidated. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of celecoxib and/or imatinib were evaluated by MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution was examined by propidium iodide (PI) assay. Apoptosis or necrosis was analyzed by Annexin-V/PI, Hoechst 33342 staining and Western blot assays. Autophagy suppression effect of celecoxib was examined by Western blot and LysoTracker probe labelling. Lysosensor probe labelling was used to detect the effect of celecoxib on the lysosomal function. RESULTS: In this study, we found that celecoxib had therapy efficacy in KBM5 and imatinib-resistant KBM5-T315I CML cell lines. Celecoxib caused significant cytotoxic effect in both cell lines, especially in KBM5-T315I cells exposed to celecoxib for 72 h. Moreover, celecoxib induced necrosis and apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in CML cell lines and patient samples. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that celecoxib prevented the autophagic flux by inhibiting lysosome function. Celecoxib was tested in combination with imatinib, demonstrating that celecoxib could strengthen the cytotoxicity of imatinib in imatinib-resistant CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that celecoxib had therapy efficacy on CML cells. And it is first time to demonstrate that celecoxib is an autophagy suppresser and a combination of celecoxib and imatinib might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for imatinib-resistant CML cells.","['Lu, Ying', 'Liu, Ling-Ling', 'Liu, Shou-Sheng', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Zou, Yong', 'Deng, Xu-Bin', 'Long, Zi-Jie', 'Liu, Quentin', 'Lin, Dong-Jun']","['Lu Y', 'Liu LL', 'Liu SS', 'Fang ZG', 'Zou Y', 'Deng XB', 'Long ZJ', 'Liu Q', 'Lin DJ']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Department of VIP Region, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. lindongjun0168@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. lindongjun0168@163.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. lindongjun0168@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160920,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Celecoxib/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Staging']",PMC5029099,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-016-1012-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-1012-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 Sep 20;14:270. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-1012-8.,,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*CML', '*Celecoxib', '*Imatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study, conducted on children with ALL whose treatment was abandoned, attempted to track all these children to ascertain the causes and outcome of therapy abandonment/refusal. In order to improve outcome of ALL, measures to prevent abandonment were introduced in the form of treatment subsidies and intensified multistage counseling. Of the 77 (of 418) children abandoning therapy, 17 (22%) refused upfront, whereas the rest abandoned during various phases of chemotherapy. Only 39 (50.6%) of these 77 families could be subsequently contacted. Financial problems, too many dependents at home, and wrong perceptions about cancer led to abandonment in majority. Children abandoning treatment before completion of induction had a significantly shorter survival than who abandoned post induction (P < .0001). Intensified preabandonment counseling and subsidized treatment led to significant reduction in abandonment rates (P < .0001).","['Roy Moulik, Nirmalya', 'Kulkarni, Ketan Prasad', 'Kumar, Archana']","['Roy Moulik N', 'Kulkarni KP', 'Kumar A']","[""a Department of Pediatrics , King George's Medical University , Lucknow , India."", 'b Division of Hematology/Oncology , Department of Pediatrics , IWK Health Centre , Halifax , Canada.', ""c Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , Department of Pediatrics , King George's Medical University , Lucknow , India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Counseling', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Treatment Refusal']",,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2016.1212956 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Aug;33(5):327-337. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2016.1212956.

Recent genome wide association and replication studies have highlighted specic polymorphisms contributing to childhood ALL predispositions mostly in European populations. It is unclear if these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of ALL. The current case-control study evaluated variants in ARID5B (rs7089424, rs10821936), IKZF1 (rs4132601) and CEBPE (rs2239633) genes, which appear most significantly associated with risk of developing childhood B-lineage ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using TaqMan assays, genotyping was conducted for 162 de novo B-lineage ALL cases and 150 unrelated healthy controls in India. Appropriate statistical methods were applied. RESULTS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies differed significantly between cases and controls at IKZF1-rs4132601 (p=0.039, p=0.015) and ARID5B-rs10821936 (p=0.028, p=0.026). Both rs10821936 (p=0.019; OR 0.67; 95% CI=0.47-0.94) and rs4132601 (p=0.018; OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48-0.94) were associated with reduced disease risk. Moreover, gender- analysis revealed male-specific risk associations for rs10821936 (p=0.041 CT+CC) and rs4132601 (p=0.005 G allele). Further, ARID5B-rs7089424 and CEBPE-rs2239633 showed a trend towards decreased disease risk but without significance (p=0.073; p=0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the rst evidence that SNPs ARID5B- rs10821936 and IKZF1-rs4132601 are associated with decreased B-lineage ALL susceptibility in Indian children. Understanding the effects of these variants in different ethnic groups is crucial as they may confer different risk of ALL within different populations.","['Bhandari, Prerana', 'Ahmad, Firoz', 'Mandava, Swarna', 'Das, Bibhu Ranjan']","['Bhandari P', 'Ahmad F', 'Mandava S', 'Das BR']","['Mentor-Molecular Pathology and Clinical Research Services, Research and Development, Goregaon, Mumbai, India E-mail : brdas@srl.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'India', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):3989-95.,,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to examine DNA promoter methylation of TET2 in 100 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 120 healthy children in southeast Iran. In addition, mRNA expression levels were assessed in 30 new cases of ALL and 32 controls. Our findings indicated that promoter methylation of TET2 significantly increases the risk of ALL (OR=2.60, 95% CI=1.31-5.12, p=0.0060) in comparison with absent methylation. Furthermore, the TET2 gene was significantly downregulated in childhood ALL compared to healthy children (p=0.0235). The results revealed that hypermethylation and downregulation of TET2 gene may play a role in predisposition to childhood ALL.

However, the mechanism of apoptosis induction in cancers differs. In this study, we have (1) investigated the anticancerous activity of curcumin on REH and RS4;11 leukemia cells and (2) studied the chemo-sensitizing potential of curcumin for doxorubicin, a drug presently used for leukemia treatment. It was found that curcumin induced a dose dependent decrease in cell viability because of apoptosis induction as visualized by annexin V-FITC/ PI staining. Curcumin-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells was mediated by PARP-1 cleavage. An increased level of caspase-3, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), cleaved PARP-1 and decreased level of Bcl2 was observed in leukemia cells after 24h of curcumin treatment. In addition, curcumin at doses lower than the IC50 value significantly enhanced doxorubicin induced cell death. Therefore, we conclude that curcumin induces apoptosis in leukemia cells via PARP-1 mediated caspase-3 dependent pathway and further may act as a potential chemo-sensitizing agent for doxorubicin.

Differentiating benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) from malignant ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) is challenging. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ow cytometry have been used as diagnostic tools in such cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case series, from 2002 to 2013 at Farabi Eye Center, 110 patients with ocular lymphoproliferative disease were enrolled. Prevalence, anatomical locations, mean age at diagnosis and the nal diagnosis of the disease with IHC were assessed. Comparison between previous pathologic diagnoses and results of IHC was made. Immunoglobulin light chains and B-cell and T-cell markers and other immuno-phenotyping markers including CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, CD10, CYCLIND1 and BCL2 were evaluated to determine the most accurate diagnosis. The lymphomas were categorized based on revised European-American lymphoma (REAL) classi cation. RESULTS: Mean age+/-SD (years) of the patients was 55.6 +/-19.3 and 61% were male. Patients with follicular lymphoma, large B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma (CLL/SLL) tended to be older. Nine patients with previous diagnoses of low grade B-cell lymphoma were re-evaluated by IHC and the new diagnoses were as follows: extranodal marginal zone lymphoma(EMZL) (n=1), SLL(n=1), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n=3), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia RLH (n=2). Two cases were excluded due to poor blocks. Flow cytometry reports in these seven patients revealed SLL with positive CD5 and CD23, MCL with positive CD5 and CyclinD1 and negative CD23, EMZL with negative CD5,CD23 and CD10. One RLH patient was negative for Kappa/Lambda and positive for CD3 and CD20 and the other was positive for all of the light chains, CD3 and CD20. Orbit (49.1%), conjunctiva (16.1%) and lacrimal glands (16.1%) were the most common sites of involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate pathological classi cation of lesions is crucial to determine proper therapeutic approaches. This can be achieved through precise histologic and IHC analyses by expert pathologists.","['Asadi-Amoli, Fahimeh', 'Nozarian, Zohreh', 'Bonaki, Hirbod Nasiri', 'Mehrtash, Vahid', 'Entezari, Samaneh']","['Asadi-Amoli F', 'Nozarian Z', 'Bonaki HN', 'Mehrtash V', 'Entezari S']","['Department of pathology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran E-mail : drznozarian@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Eye/pathology', 'Eye Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Iran', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pseudolymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(8):3727-31.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms remain unclear. This study was to investigate whether and how Bmi-1 regulates stemness of gastric cancer. METHODS: We firstly explored the role of Bmi-1 in regulating stem cell-like features in gastric cancer. Secondly, we screened out its downstream miRNAs and clarified whether these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of stemness. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms how Bmi-1 regulates miRNAs. RESULTS: Bmi-1 positively regulates stem cell-like properties of gastric cancer and upregulates miR-21 and miR-34a. There was a positive correlation between Bmi-1 and miR-21 expression in gastric cancer tissues. MiR-21 mediated the function of Bmi-1 in regulating stem cell-like properties, while miR-34a negatively regulates stem cell-like characteristics via downregulating Bmi-1. Bmi-1 binds to PTEN promoter and directly inhibits PTEN and thereafter activates AKT. Bmi-1 also regulates p53 and PTEN via miR-21. Bmi-1 activated NF-kB via AKT and enhanced the binding of NF-kB to the promoter of miR-21 and miR-34a and increased their expression. CONCLUSIONS: Bmi-1 positively regulates stem cell-like properties via upregulating miR-21, and miR-34a negatively regulates stem cell-like characteristics by negative feedback regulation of Bmi-1 in gastric cancer. Bmi-1 upregulates miR-21 and miR-34a by activating AKT-NF-kB pathway.","['Wang, Xiaofeng', 'Wang, Chang', 'Zhang, Xiaowei', 'Hua, Ruixi', 'Gan, Lu', 'Huang, Mingzhu', 'Zhao, Liqin', 'Ni, Sujie', 'Guo, Weijian']","['Wang X', 'Wang C', 'Zhang X', 'Hua R', 'Gan L', 'Huang M', 'Zhao L', 'Ni S', 'Guo W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China. guoweijian1@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. guoweijian1@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160920,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Specimen Handling', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC5029045,,2016/09/21 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0323-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0323-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 20;9(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0323-9.,,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6155-8345'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bmi-1', '*Cancer stem cell', '*Gastric cancer', '*miRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptotic signaling mediated by receptor of activated C kinase 1 (Rack1), protein kinase C (PKC) and FEM1 homolog b (FEM1b) was investigated in two T-ALL-derived cell lines (Jurkat and CCRF-CEM) following treatment with chemotherapy drugs vincristine and prednisone. Serum starvation or chemotherapeutic drugs significantly reduced Rack1 level and PKC activation, while promoted cellular apoptosis in both cell lines. Rack1 overexpression protected T-ALL cell against starvation or chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Rack1 overexpression reduced the level of cytochrome c and active caspase 3 as well as FEM1b and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), and inhibited induction of cellular apoptosis in chemotherapeutic drug-treated Jurkat cell. Interaction of Rack1 and PKCalpha, not PKCbeta, was detected in both cell lines. Of note, Rack1 overexpression abrogated reduction of PKC kinase activity in chemotherapeutic drug-treated T-ALL cell. PKC kinase inhibitor Go6976 or siPKCalpha inhibited downregulation of FEM1b and/or Apaf-1, and thus increased cellular apoptosis in Rack1-overexpressed T-ALL cell receiving chemotherapeutic drugs. Accordingly, our data provided evidence that increased Rack1-mediated upregulation of PKC kinase activity may be responsible for the development of chemoresistance in T-ALL-derived cell line potentially by reducing FEM1b and Apaf-1 level.","['Lei, Jie', 'Li, Qi', 'Gao, Ying', 'Zhao, Lei', 'Liu, Yanbo']","['Lei J', 'Li Q', 'Gao Y', 'Zhao L', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, PR China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, People's Hospital of Shaanxi Province, Shaanxi, XiAn, PR China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160920,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors for Activated C Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",PMC5028770,,2016/09/21 06:00,2018/06/07 06:00,['2016/09/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['srep33717 [pii]', '10.1038/srep33717 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 20;6:33717. doi: 10.1038/srep33717.,,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FEM1B protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RACK1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors for Activated C Kinase)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these cases have been occurring more frequently as a secondary event in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents for CLL. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 77-year-old man who presented with fatigue, pallor and lower limb pain and weakness. Initial laboratory studies showed Hb 7.7 g/dl, WBC 279.6 x 10(9)/1, PLT 143x 10(9)/1. The peripheral blood (PB) smear examination showed circulating blast cells (20 %) cells and 50 % lymphocytes, with smudge cells. A bone marrow examination showed infiltration by two discrete abnormal cell populations, one represents the leukemic blast cells (60 %) and the other represents small mature lymphocytes (30 %). The immunologic phenotype of blasts was characterized by the co-expression of CD13, CD33, CD14, CD4, CD15, CD64, HLA-DR, CD11c. Lymphocytes were characterized by a typical CLL immunophenotype: CD19+, CD5+, CD23+, CD20+ (dim) and negative for FMC7, CD34, CD10 and TdT. Cytogenetic studies were negative for CLL and AML panels. PCR assays for AML specific genetic abnormalities were negative. Immunoglobulin gene analysis established the clonal nature of the B-cell expansion. A final diagnosis of concomitant CLL and AML(FAB: M5) was made. CONCLUSION: We have reported a case in which there was simultaneous presentation of AML and CLL. Both forms of leukemia were well documented by morphology, cytometric analysis and molecular studies. Our findings support the idea that this rare concurrence of AML and untreated CLL may represent two separate disease processes.","['Al Mussaed, Eman', 'Osman, Hani', 'Elyamany, Ghaleb']","['Al Mussaed E', 'Osman H', 'Elyamany G']","['Department of Basic Sciences, Hematopathology Division, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Clinical Hematology and Stem cell Therapy, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, PO Box 7897, Riyadh, 11159, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ghalebelyamany@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160919,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/metabolism']",PMC5028963,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2015/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2780-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2780-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Sep 19;16(1):739. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2780-5.,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Case rep', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that rTM increased levels of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and protected endothelial cells from calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which rTM enhances barrier function in vascular endothelial cells remain unknown. Here we show that exposure of vascular endothelial EA.hy926 cells to CsA induced phosphorylation of Src/vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and translocation of VE-cadherin from cell surface to cytoplasm, resulting in an increase in vascular permeability. In addition, CsA increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, associated with an increase in nuclear levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) which also enhanced vascular permeability. Importantly, the fourth and fifth regions of epidermal growth factor-like domain of TM (TME45) attenuated CsA-induced p-Src/VE-cadherin and vascular permeability in parallel with a decrease in nuclear levels of NF-kappaB and cytokine production in EA.hy926 cells. In conclusion, TM, especially TME45, maintains vascular integrity, at least in part, via Src signaling.","['Ikezoe, T', 'Yang, J', 'Nishioka, C', 'Umezawa, K', 'Yokoyama, A']","['Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Nishioka C', 'Umezawa K', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Target Medicine Screening, School of Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cadherins/*metabolism', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Capillary Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Thrombomodulin/*administration & dosage', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016241 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.241 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Feb;52(2):245-251. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.241.

We analyzed 192 consecutive patients with de novo AML aged >/=60 years who were treated with intensive chemotherapy. About 115 patients (60%) achieved complete hematologic remission (CR). Among several parameters, the karyotype was the only independent variable predicting CR (P < 0.05). About 92% (105/115) of the CR-patients received up to four consolidation cycles of intermediate dose ARA-C. Median continuous CR (CCR) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 1.3 and 1.1 years, respectively. CCR, DFS, and survival at 5 years were 23%, 18%, and 15%, respectively. Only karyotype and mutated NPM1 (NPM1mut) were independent predictors of survival. NPM1mut showed a particular prognostic impact in patients with normal (CN) or non-monosomal (Mkneg) karyotype by Haemato-Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands (HOVON)-criteria, or intermediate karyotype by Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-criteria. The median CCR was 0.94, 1.6, 0.9, and 0.5 years for core-binding-factor, CN/Mkneg-NPM1mut, CN/Mkneg-NPM1-wild-type AML, and AML with monosomal karyotype, respectively, and the 5-year survival was 25%, 39%, 2%, and 0%, respectively (P < 0.05). Similar results (0.9, 1.5, 0.9, and 0.5 years) were obtained using modified SWOG criteria and NPM1 mutation status (P < 0.05). In summary, elderly patients with CN/Mkneg-NPM1mut or CBF AML can achieve long term CCR when treated with intensive induction and consolidation therapy whereas most elderly patients with CN/Mkneg-NPM1wt or Mkpos AML may not benefit from intensive chemotherapy. For these patients either hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation or alternative treatments have to be considered. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1239-1245, 2016.

We examined whether DNA methylation of cadherin superfamily genes is a useful biomarker for ALL relapse. PROCEDURE: We used Infinium Methylation 450K Arrays to assess genome-wide DNA methylation status. The methylation status of each individual gene was then determined by a combination of bisulfite restriction analysis and genome bisulfite sequencing. mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Cadherin superfamily genes including cadherin (CDH) 1, protocadherin (PCDH) 8, and PCDH17 were selected for analysis of methylation status. In 40 patient samples with B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL at diagnosis, the methylation frequencies of CDH1, PCDH8, and PCDH17 were 62.5, 55, and 30%, respectively. CDH1 and PCDH8 methylation was also detected in 80 and 20% of control bone marrow (BM) samples, respectively. On the contrary, PCDH17 was unmethylated in all control BM samples. There was a significant correlation between the methylation status of PCDH17 (but not CDH1 and PCDH8) and event-free survival or overall survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only PCDH17 methylation was associated with an increased risk for relapse and mortality in patients with BCP ALL. CONCLUSION: PCDH17 methylation at diagnosis was closely related to poor prognosis and thus could be used as a new biomarker to predict relapse in patients with BCP ALL.","['Uyen, Thanh Nha', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', ""Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y"", 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Kurata, Takashi', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Uyen TN', 'Sakashita K', 'Al-Kzayer LF', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Kurata T', 'Koike K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Nagano, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protocadherins', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26259 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Mar;64(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26259.

An emerging concept has proposed that interactions between the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and leukemia cells reduce the sensitivity of the leukemia cells to chemotherapy. As an important element of the tumor microenvironment, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to be activated modulators in the chemo-resistance of many solid tumors. But their contribution to AML has yet to be fully understood. Here we report a critical role for CAFs which were thought to be a survival and chemo-protective factor for leukemia cells. METHODS: A retrospective study on the BM biopsies from 63 primary AML patients and 59 normal controls was applied to quantitative analysis the fiber stroma in the BM sections. Then immunohistochemistry on the BM biopsies were used to detect the makers of the CAFs. Their effects on drug resistance of leukemia cells were further to be assessed by co-cultured experiments in vitro. Moreover, the possible mechanisms involved in CAF-mediated chemo-protection of AML cells was investigated by antibody neutralization and siRNA knockdown experiments, with particular emphasis on the role of GDF15. RESULTS: In our study, excessive reticular fibers in the BM led to higher frequency of relapse and mortality in primary AML patients, bringing the inspiration for us to investigate the functional roles of the fiber-devied cells. We declared that the CAF cells which expressed higher levels of FSP1, alpha-SMA or FAP protein were widely distributed in the marrow of AML. Then in vitro co-cultured tests showed that these CAFs could protect leukemia cell lines (THP-1/K562) from chemotherapy. Interestingly, this effect could be decreased by either treatment with a neutralizing anti-GDF15 antibody or knockdown GDF15 (with siGDF15) in CAFs. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the GDF15(+) cells mainly co-localized with FAP, which was identified as the typical phenotype of CAFs in the BM stroma. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly demonstrate that the functional CAFs are widespread within the BM of AML patients and should be a critical chemo-protective element for AML cells by producing amount of GDF15.","['Zhai, Yuanmei', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Hui', 'Lu, Wei', 'Liu, Sihong', 'Yu, Yehua', 'Weng, Wei', 'Ding, Zhiyong', 'Zhu, Qi', 'Shi, Jun']","['Zhai Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Lu W', 'Liu S', 'Yu Y', 'Weng W', 'Ding Z', 'Zhu Q', 'Shi J']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200336, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital South campus, Shanghai, 201400, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Affiliated Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200011, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200233, China. junshi@sjtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC5029001,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-016-0405-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-016-0405-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 19;35(1):147. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0405-0.,,"['0 (GDF15 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bone marrow microenvironment', '*CAFs', '*GDF15']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When intravenous (IV) infusion replaced intramuscular (IM) injection as the standard route of administration, there were early reports suggested an increased hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) rate with IV administration. There have since been eight published reports comparing the incidence of HSRs occurring with IV versus IM pegaspargase. This review analyzes the reports and summarizes their consistent findings where feasible. For grade 3-4 HSRs, the rates are comparable with IV and IM administration. Grade 2 HSRs appear to be more likely with IV than IM administration but the validity of the difference is uncertain. Multiple factors confound the analyses, including the historically controlled nature of the comparisons and the increased likelihood of reporting adverse reactions with IV administration. In summary, the reports do not support the conclusion that pegaspargase-induced HSR rate is more frequent with IV administration.","['Beaupin, Lynda Kwon', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Barth, Matthew J', 'Franklin, Irene', 'Jaeger, Raven', 'Kamath, Priyanka', 'Schreiber, Brian', 'Bleyer, Archie']","['Beaupin LK', 'Bostrom B', 'Barth MJ', 'Franklin I', 'Jaeger R', 'Kamath P', 'Schreiber B', 'Bleyer A']","['a Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Buffalo , NY , USA.', ""b Children's Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN , USA."", 'a Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'c Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals , Gaithersburg , MD , USA.', 'c Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals , Gaithersburg , MD , USA.', 'c Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals , Gaithersburg , MD , USA.', 'c Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals , Gaithersburg , MD , USA.', 'd Oregon Health and Science University , Portland , OR , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20160919,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1218004 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Apr;58(4):766-772. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1218004.

Identifying therapeutic targets to eradicate CML LSCs may be a strategy to cure CML. In the present study, we discovered a positive feedback loop between BCR-ABL and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in CML cells. Overexpression of PRMT5 was observed in human CML LSCs. Silencing PRMT5 with shRNA or blocking PRMT5 methyltransferase activity with the small-molecule inhibitor PJ-68 reduced survival, serial replating capacity, and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) in LSCs from CML patients. Further, PRMT5 knockdown or PJ-68 treatment dramatically prolonged survival in a murine model of retroviral BCR-ABL-driven CML and impaired the in vivo self-renewal capacity of transplanted CML LSCs. PJ-68 also inhibited long-term engraftment of human CML CD34+ cells in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, inhibition of PRMT5 abrogated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in CML CD34+ cells by depleting dishevelled homolog 3 (DVL3). This study suggests that epigenetic methylation modification on histone protein arginine residues is a regulatory mechanism to control self-renewal of LSCs and indicates that PRMT5 may represent a potential therapeutic target against LSCs.","['Jin, Yanli', 'Zhou, Jingfeng', 'Xu, Fang', 'Jin, Bei', 'Cui, Lijing', 'Wang, Yun', 'Du, Xin', 'Li, Juan', 'Li, Peng', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Jin Y', 'Zhou J', 'Xu F', 'Jin B', 'Cui L', 'Wang Y', 'Du X', 'Li J', 'Li P', 'Ren R', 'Pan J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160919,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['1-Naphthylamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5096815,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['85239 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI85239 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Oct 3;126(10):3961-3980. doi: 10.1172/JCI85239.

Several members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family are implicated in breast cancer bone colonization, but the role for the IL-6 cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in this process is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that LIF provides a pro-dormancy signal to breast cancer cells in the bone. In breast cancer patients, LIF receptor (LIFR) levels are lower with bone metastases and are significantly and inversely correlated with patient outcome and hypoxia gene activity. Hypoxia also reduces the LIFR:STAT3:SOCS3 signalling pathway in breast cancer cells. Loss of the LIFR or STAT3 enables otherwise dormant breast cancer cells to downregulate dormancy-, quiescence- and cancer stem cell-associated genes, and to proliferate in and specifically colonize the bone, suggesting that LIFR:STAT3 signalling confers a dormancy phenotype in breast cancer cells disseminated to bone.","['Johnson, Rachelle W', 'Finger, Elizabeth C', 'Olcina, Monica M', 'Vilalta, Marta', 'Aguilera, Todd', 'Miao, Yu', 'Merkel, Alyssa R', 'Johnson, Joshua R', 'Sterling, Julie A', 'Wu, Joy Y', 'Giaccia, Amato J']","['Johnson RW', 'Finger EC', 'Olcina MM', 'Vilalta M', 'Aguilera T', 'Miao Y', 'Merkel AR', 'Johnson JR', 'Sterling JA', 'Wu JY', 'Giaccia AJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs: Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (VISN 9), Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs: Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (VISN 9), Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,,,PMC5357601,,2016/09/20 06:00,2016/09/20 06:01,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/20 06:01 [medline]']","['ncb3408 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb3408 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2016 Oct;18(10):1078-1089. doi: 10.1038/ncb3408.

METHODS: Consecutive adults with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2004 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were screened by perirectal PCR swabs targeting vanA and vanB twice weekly while inpatient. RESULTS: Of a total of 203 patients (median age 54 years), 73 (36%) were VRE colonized prior to HCT, 23 (11%) became colonized within the first 100 days, and 107 (53%) remained non-colonized through day 100 post HCT. A landmark analysis on HCT day 0 revealed no significant difference in overall survival according to pre-transplant colonization status (P=.20). However, patients with subsequent VRE colonization within the first 100 days of HCT had a significantly worse survival on both univariable (P=.04) and multivariable (P=.03) analyses. During the first 30 days post HCT, 11 (5% of total and 11% of the VRE colonized) patients developed VRE BSI. Ten (91%) of these had screened positive for VRE colonization before the bacteremia. Age >/=60 years, HCT-comorbidity index >/=3, and VRE colonization were independent risk factors for VRE BSI on multivariable analysis (P=.04, .03, .003, respectively). Only 1 (9%) patient with VRE BSI died within the first 100 days post HCT. CONCLUSION: VRE colonization is a surrogate marker and not an independent predictor of worse outcomes post HCT. VRE BSI is associated with increased morbidity, but does not impact post-HCT survival.","['Hefazi, Mehrdad', 'Damlaj, Moussab', 'Alkhateeb, Hassan B', 'Partain, Daniel K', 'Patel, Robin', 'Razonable, Raymund R', 'Gastineau, Dennis A', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Hogan, William J', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Hefazi M', 'Damlaj M', 'Alkhateeb HB', 'Partain DK', 'Patel R', 'Razonable RR', 'Gastineau DA', 'Al-Kali A', 'Hashmi SK', 'Hogan WJ', 'Litzow MR', 'Patnaik MM']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Microbiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161111,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Carbon-Oxygen Ligases/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/blood/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Vancomycin/therapeutic use', 'Vancomycin Resistance/genetics', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2016/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.12612 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2016 Dec;18(6):913-920. doi: 10.1111/tid.12612.

A total of 107 AML patients who underwent chemotherapy for at least 30 consecutive dayswere recruited to this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical-trial which was conducted in the Imam Reza and Ghaem teaching hospitals (Mashhad, Iran). They weredivided into two age and sex-matched groups: 58 treated and 49 untreated patients. A combination of 50 grams of honey and 150 grams of Ardehwas added to the treated group's diet for 30consecutive days, three times each day; while the untreated group received their regular diet.Both groups received their standard medication for AML as well. After one month, they were all examined and lab tests were done on them by an internist and laboratory technicians who were blinded to the subject allocations. Mean value of WBC count in treated group was significantly lower than that of untreated group. Duration of fever and admission in the hospital due to fever were both significantly lower in the treated group (P=0.014, P=0.032 respectively). Total gastrointestinal complications were significantly less in the treated group one month after therapy with the special honey and Ardeh compound.No unusual or unexpected side effects were observed.

With the advancement of immunodeficient xenograft models, it has become possible to use human stem/progenitor cells for in vivo studies as well as cells directly derived from CML patients. These models not only mimic CML but also have been instrumental in uncovering various fundamental mechanisms of CML disease progression and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. With the availability of iPSC technology, it has become feasible to derive, maintain, and expand CML subclones that are at least genetically identical to those in patients.

Owing to the exclusivity of this enzyme in B cells, the acronym could represent B cell tyrosine kinase. BTK is activated by the Lyn and SYK protein kinases following activation of the B cell receptor. BTK in turn catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cgamma2 leading to the downstream activation of the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and the NF-kappaB pathways. Both pathways participate in the maturation of antibody-producing B cells. The BTK domains include a PH (pleckstrin homology) domain that interacts with membrane-associated phosphatidyl inositol trisphosphate, a TH (TEC homology) domain, which is followed by an SH3, SH2, and finally a protein kinase domain. Dysregulation of B cell receptor signaling occurs in several B cell neoplasms including mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib is FDA-approved as first-line or second line treatment for these diseases. The drug binds tightly in the ATP-binding pocket of BTK making salt bridges with residues within the hinge that connects the two lobes of the enzyme; then its unsaturated acrylamide group forms a covalent bond with BTK cysteine 481 to form an inactive adduct. In addition to the treatment of various B cell lymphomas, ibrutinib is under clinical trials for the treatment of numerous solid tumors owing to the role of tumor-promoting inflammation in the pathogenesis of neoplastic diseases.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr']",['Roskoski R Jr'],"['Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, 3754 Brevard Road, Suite 116, Box 19, Horse Shoe, NC 28742-8814, United States.

Therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent a powerful treatment strategy. We leveraged the observation that the majority of AML, despite their genetically heterogeneity, share in the expression of HoxA9, a gene normally downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Using a conditional HoxA9 model system, we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen and defined compounds that overcame differentiation blockade. Target identification led to the unanticipated discovery that inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enables myeloid differentiation in human and mouse AML models. In vivo, DHODH inhibitors reduced leukemic cell burden, decreased levels of leukemia-initiating cells, and improved survival. These data demonstrate the role of DHODH as a metabolic regulator of differentiation and point to its inhibition as a strategy for overcoming differentiation blockade in AML.","['Sykes, David B', 'Kfoury, Youmna S', 'Mercier, Francois E', 'Wawer, Mathias J', 'Law, Jason M', 'Haynes, Mark K', 'Lewis, Timothy A', 'Schajnovitz, Amir', 'Jain, Esha', 'Lee, Dongjun', 'Meyer, Hanna', 'Pierce, Kerry A', 'Tolliday, Nicola J', 'Waller, Anna', 'Ferrara, Steven J', 'Eheim, Ashley L', 'Stoeckigt, Detlef', 'Maxcy, Katrina L', 'Cobert, Julien M', 'Bachand, Jacqueline', 'Szekely, Brian A', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Kotz, Joanne D', 'Clish, Clary B', 'Sadreyev, Ruslan I', 'Clemons, Paul A', 'Janzer, Andreas', 'Schreiber, Stuart L', 'Scadden, David T']","['Sykes DB', 'Kfoury YS', 'Mercier FE', 'Wawer MJ', 'Law JM', 'Haynes MK', 'Lewis TA', 'Schajnovitz A', 'Jain E', 'Lee D', 'Meyer H', 'Pierce KA', 'Tolliday NJ', 'Waller A', 'Ferrara SJ', 'Eheim AL', 'Stoeckigt D', 'Maxcy KL', 'Cobert JM', 'Bachand J', 'Szekely BA', 'Mukherjee S', 'Sklar LA', 'Kotz JD', 'Clish CB', 'Sadreyev RI', 'Clemons PA', 'Janzer A', 'Schreiber SL', 'Scadden DT']","['Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

Activated death receptor CD95 after ligation with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody (mAb) resulted in the regression of BL via induction of apoptosis, suggesting a decrease of survival protein expression. Here, CD95-mediated apoptotic pathways in BL B-cell lines (Raji and Daudi) following treatment with anti-CD95 mAb was investigated with the cause-and-effects on pim-1 gene expression, in comparison with leukemic cell line (K562) used as CD95-negative cells. Immunohistochemical staining for CD95 and Pim-1 was performed, and the effects of anti-CD95 mAb on apoptotic signalling using western blotting, on caspase activity and cell survival of BL B-cell and leukemic cell lines were determined. We showed that Raji cells expressed more CD95 receptors than Daudi cells. Half of each population underwent apoptosis accompanied by decreased cell viability after anti-CD95 mAb treatment. Distinct extrinsic and intrinsic CD95-mediated apoptotic pathways in Raji and Daudi cells were revealed by high caspase activity and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, respectively. We observed decreased Pim-1 transcript and protein expression levels with increased heat-shock protein (Hsp)70 and decreased Hsp90 expression in anti-CD95 mAb-treated cells. Throughout the study, K562 cells did not undergo apoptosis upon anti-CD95 mAb treatment. Pim-1 knockdown following to stable transfection with plasmid vectors induced apoptosis and decreased viability of BL and K562 cells. Therefore, CD95-mediated apoptosis induces Pim-1 down-regulation in BL B-cells, but Pim-1 down-regulation cannot fully eradicate BL and leukaemia.","['Matou-Nasri, Sabine', 'Rabhan, Zaki', 'Al-Baijan, Haya', 'Al-Eidi, Hamad', 'Yahya, Wesam Bin', 'Al Abdulrahman, Abdelkareem', 'Almobadel, Nasser', 'Alsubeai, Mona', 'Al Ghamdi, Saleh', 'Alaskar, Ahmed', 'AlBalwi, Mohammed', 'Alzahrani, Mohsen', 'Alabdulkareem, Ibrahim']","['Matou-Nasri S', 'Rabhan Z', 'Al-Baijan H', 'Al-Eidi H', 'Yahya WB', 'Al Abdulrahman A', 'Almobadel N', 'Alsubeai M', 'Al Ghamdi S', 'Alaskar A', 'AlBalwi M', 'Alzahrani M', 'Alabdulkareem I']","['Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard - Health Affairs (MNGHA), P.O.

It is particularly relevant when a tumor suppressor is excessively degraded by an overactive oncogenic E3 ligase. We previously discovered that the E6-associated protein (E6AP; as classified in the human papilloma virus context) is an E3 ligase that has an important role in the cellular stress response, and it directly targets the tumor-suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) for proteasomal degradation. In this study, we have examined the role of the E6AP-PML axis in prostate cancer (PC). We show that knockdown (KD) of E6AP expression attenuates growth of PC cell lines in vitro. We validated this finding in vivo using cell line xenografts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse genetics. We found that KD of E6AP attenuates cancer cell growth by promoting cellular senescence in vivo, which correlates with restoration of tumor suppression by PML. In addition, we show that KD of E6AP sensitizes cells to radiation-induced death. Overall, our findings demonstrate a role for E6AP in the promotion of PC and support E6AP targeting as a novel approach for PC treatment, either alone or in combination with radiation.","['Paul, P J', 'Raghu, D', 'Chan, A-L', 'Gulati, T', 'Lambeth, L', 'Takano, E', 'Herold, M J', 'Hagekyriakou, J', 'Vessella, R L', 'Fedele, C', 'Shackleton, M', 'Williams, E D', 'Fox, S', 'Williams, S', 'Haupt, S', 'Gamell, C', 'Haupt, Y']","['Paul PJ', 'Raghu D', 'Chan AL', 'Gulati T', 'Lambeth L', 'Takano E', 'Herold MJ', 'Hagekyriakou J', 'Vessella RL', 'Fedele C', 'Shackleton M', 'Williams ED', 'Fox S', 'Williams S', 'Haupt S', 'Gamell C', 'Haupt Y']","['The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Physical Sciences, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Urology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Development and Treatment Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology and Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Development and Treatment Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology and Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre-Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology and Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Tumor Suppression Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology and Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160919,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Burden', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016159 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Dec 1;35(48):6235-6245. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.159.

Using Mixed-Lineage-Leukemia-5 (Mll5)-deficient mice as prototypical examples, we have identified a mechanistic pathway linking DNA damage and HSPC malfunction. We show that Mll5 deficiency results in accumulation of DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HSPCs. Reduction of ROS efficiently reverses hematopoietic defects, establishing ROS as a major cause of impaired HSPC function. The Ink4a/Arf locus also contributes to HSPC phenotypes, at least in part via promotion of ROS. Strikingly, toxic ROS levels in Mll5(-/-) mice are critically dependent on type 1 interferon (IFN-1) signaling, which triggers mitochondrial accumulation of full-length Bid. Genetic inactivation of Bid diminishes ROS levels and reverses HSPC defects in Mll5(-/-) mice. Overall, therefore, our findings highlight an unexpected IFN-1 > Bid > ROS pathway underlying DNA damage-associated HSPC malfunction.","['Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Kumar, Suresh', 'Allies, Gabriele', 'Bausinger, Julia', 'Beckel, Franziska', 'Hofemeister, Helmut', 'Mulaw, Medhanie', 'Madan, Vikas', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Doehner, Konstanze', 'Speit, Gunter', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Fehling, Hans Joerg']","['Tasdogan A', 'Kumar S', 'Allies G', 'Bausinger J', 'Beckel F', 'Hofemeister H', 'Mulaw M', 'Madan V', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek K', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Doehner K', 'Speit G', 'Stewart AF', 'Fehling HJ']","['Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Genomics, BioInnovations Zentrum, Technische Universitat, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Clinics, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Genomics, BioInnovations Zentrum, Technische Universitat, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, 89081 Ulm, Germany.

The role of CD44 in tumorigenesis is due to its binding to extracellular matrix components, including hyaluronan (HA) and osteopontin (OPN), and to messenger molecules, such as growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment. HA and OPN are highly abundant in the leukemic stem cell niche and in solid tumors of various cancer types, where they contribute to the maintenance of the stemness of malignant cells. CD44 has consequently been recognized as a cancer stem cell marker in several types of cancers, which has been a topic of much recent research. In this review we have addressed the question of how CD44 might promote cancer cell stemness by interacting with extracellular matrix components, growth factors and cytokines.","['Morath, I', 'Hartmann, T N', 'Orian-Rousseau, V']","['Morath I', 'Hartmann TN', 'Orian-Rousseau V']","['Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe, Germany.

Moreover, mutations in the additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) gene were recently shown in various myeloid malignancies.There were no previous studies investigating the incidence of the ASXL1 and JAK2V617F mutations in Iranian patients with CML. Consequently, this study focuses on the analysis of these mutations in patients with CML. METHODS: In total, 66 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CML were examined at the time of diagnosis. Thirty healthy subjects were checked as controls. Exon 12 of ASXL1 was amplified from genomic DNA and bidirectionally sequenced. We also performed JAK2V617F screening by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. RESULTS: Mutations in the ASXL1 gene were found in five out of 66 CML patients (7.6%). We identified a novel variant (c.1968G > A, p.Asp656Asn) in one of the patients that has not been reported before. We also identified BCR-ABL and JAK2V617F mutations simultaneously in four patients (6%). CONCLUSION: Our demonstration of ASXL1 mutation, a putative tumor suppressor gene, represents an important molecular abnormality in CML. We also showed that concomitant detection of BCR-ABL and JAK2V617F mutations has a relatively high incidence in Iranian patients.","['Valikhani, Amir', 'Poopak, Behzad', 'Ferdowsi, Shirin', 'Azizi Tabesh, Ghasem', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Saraf Kazeruoni, Ehsan', 'Rezaei, Negar', 'Farshchi, Alireza', 'Amirizadeh, Naser']","['Valikhani A', 'Poopak B', 'Ferdowsi S', 'Azizi Tabesh G', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Saraf Kazeruoni E', 'Rezaei N', 'Farshchi A', 'Amirizadeh N']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Tehran Medical Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Urmia University, Urmia, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/20 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/09/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12588 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Apr;13(2):e41-e47. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12588.

PATIENTS: We analyzed the correlation between different cytarabine (Ara-c) regimens and outcome in 255 t(8;21) AML patients in China who received postremission consolidation chemotherapy only. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the high-dose Ara-c group (HDAC; 2</= Ara-c </=3 g/m2), intermediate-dose Ara-c group (MDAC; 1.0</= Ara-c <2.0 g/m2), low-dose Ara-c group (LDAC; 0.2< Ara-c <1.0 g/m2) and standard-dose Ara-c group (SDAC; 0.1</= Ara-c </=0.2 g/m2) were 65.3, 39.4, 25.2 and 27.9%, respectively (p = 0.003). In the HDAC group, but not in the MDAC group, the 5-year OS of patients who achieved 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy was superior to those who underwent 1-2 cycles (84.4 vs. 43.6%, p < 0.05), and the 3-year OS of patients who achieved an accumulated 36 g/m2 of Ara-c was significantly higher compared to those who did not (85.3 vs. 39.2%, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that factors such as WBC >3.5 x 109/l, PLT </=30 x 109/l, and extramedullary infiltration were associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: The survival of t(8;21) AML patients treated with high-dose Ara-c (>/=2 g/m2) was superior to other dose levels in postremission consolidation chemotherapy. Patient survival was improved by 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy with an accumulated concentration of 36 g/m2 of Ara-c.

Series using stringent diagnostic criteria incorporating bone marrow biopsy (BMB), immunophenotyping, and T-cell receptor rearrangements are even scarcer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study was a single-center series of 39 patients with LGL leukemia diagnosed using immunohistochemical analysis of BMB samples and flow cytometric and molecular data. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range, 1.0-15.1 years), 15 patients (38%) never required treatment. Of the remaining 24 patients requiring treatment, 13 were initially treated with prednisolone, for an overall response rate (ORR) of 84.6% and a median duration of response (DOR) of 13.5 months (range, 5.7-70.3 months). Of the 24 patients, 9 received oral low-dose weekly methotrexate as first-line therapy, with 8 (89%) achieving a hematologic response and a median DOR of 132.7 months (range, 6.7-180.5 months). Another 5 patients received methotrexate after prednisolone failure; all 5 responded, with a median DOR of 14 months (range, 4-96 months). Only 2 patients developed progression during methotrexate therapy, and 4 patients experienced responses lasting >/= 5 years. CONCLUSION: Single-agent oral methotrexate appears to be highly efficacious, resulting in long response durations and minimal toxicity.","['Munir, Talha', 'Bishton, Mark J', 'Carter, Ian', 'McMillan, Andrew', ""O'Connor, Simon"", 'Sovani, Vishakha', 'Haynes, Andrew P', 'Fox, Christopher P']","['Munir T', 'Bishton MJ', 'Carter I', 'McMillan A', ""O'Connor S"", 'Sovani V', 'Haynes AP', 'Fox CP']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Nottingham University Hospitals National Health Services Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom.

Several studies have measured bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) in MDS patients and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients transformed from MDS, and MVD was higher in MDS patients than controls, but was lower than in AML patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed in bone marrow blast cells, and an autocrine VEGF signaling mechanism has been established in MDS. Increased bone marrow angiogenesis and VEGF concentrations are adverse prognostic features in all of these patients. In this study, 69 patients were treated in two groups: hypomethylating agents or supportive care with oxymetholone+/-pyridoxine. We evaluated the MVD and VEGF expression of paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples from patients. We also investigated the relationship between angiogenesis-related biomarkers including MVD, VEGF expression, and clinical factors. The patient median age was 65 years, and the median follow-up duration was 28 months. MVD assessment among subtypes of WHO MDS classification showed that the MVD of RCUD was significantly lower than in other types (p=0.02). However, there was no significant difference in VEGF expression according to the subtype of MDS. Although MVD and VEGF expression did not differ between risk groups based on the IPSS, the low risk group tended to have lower expression of angiogenesis-related biomarkers. MDS patients receiving hypomethylating agents had significantly lower MVD expression in responders than in non-responders (6.13+/-3.38 vs. 9.89+/-2.10, respectively, p=0.039). In a consecutive evaluation at the time of diagnosis and 3 months after the initial treatment, the group with a decrease or no change of MVD had a higher response rate compared to that in the group with an increase of MVD (92.9% vs. 58.8%, respectively, p=0.045). Adverse prognostic factors included older age, MDS type other than RCUD, a higher IPSS risk group, and abnormal cytogenetics. Although angiogenesis-related markers did not demonstrate any significant prognostic association with survival, MVD (>/=10n/mm(2)) and a strong expression of VEGF seemed to be associated with lower survival rate. These data suggested that the MVD value might be helpful in predicting responsiveness to treatment, especially in MDS patients treated with hypomethylating agents. Although angiogenesis-related markers including VEGF did not demonstrate a significant association with survival outcomes, we observed that high MVD and strong VEGF expression seemed to be associated with lower survival rate. Therefore, biologic markers related to angiogenesis might have a potential as prognostic factors for MDS patients.","['Kim, Chan Kyu', 'Han, Dong Hoon', 'Ji, Young Seok', 'Lee, Min Sung', 'Min, Chang Wook', 'Park, Seong Kyu', 'Kim, Se Hyung', 'Yun, Jina', 'Kim, Hyun Jeung', 'Kim, Kyoung Ha', 'Lee, Kyu Taek', 'Won, Jong Ho', 'Hong, Dae Sik', 'Kim, Hee Kyung']","['Kim CK', 'Han DH', 'Ji YS', 'Lee MS', 'Min CW', 'Park SK', 'Kim SH', 'Yun J', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim KH', 'Lee KT', 'Won JH', 'Hong DS', 'Kim HK']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, 170 Jomaru-ro, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, 14584, South Korea.

We examined a large and diverse cohort of survivors to identify risk predictors and modifiers of these outcomes. METHODS: In this cohort study, cognitive and behaviour symptoms were assessed via a standardised parent questionnaire for 1560 adolescent survivors of ALL diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. Clinically significant symptoms (>/=90th percentile) and learning problems were compared between survivors and a sibling cohort. Multivariable regression models were used to examine associations with demographic and treatment characteristics. Models were adjusted for inverse probability of sampling weights to reflect undersampling of ALL survivors in the expansion cohort. In a subset of survivors with longitudinal data (n=925), we examined associations between adolescent symptoms or problems and adult educational attainment. FINDINGS: Compared with siblings, survivors treated with chemotherapy only were more likely to demonstrate headstrong behaviour (155 [19%] of 752 survivors vs 88 [14%] of 610 siblings, p=0.010), inattention-hyperactivity (15 [19%] vs 86 [14%], p<0.0001), social withdrawal (142 [18%] vs 75 [12%], p=0.002), and had higher rates of learning problems (191 [28%] vs 76 [14%], p<0.0001). In multivariable models among survivors, increased cumulative dose of intravenous methotrexate (ie, >4.3 g/m(2)) conferred increased risk of inattention-hyperactivity (relative risk [RR] 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.08). Adolescent survivors with cognitive or behaviour problems and those with learning problems were less likely to graduate from college as young adults than adolescent survivors without cognitive or behaviour problems. INTERPRETATION: Although modern therapy for childhood ALL has eliminated the use of cranial radiation therapy, adolescent survivors treated with chemotherapy only remain at increased risk for cognitive, behaviour, and academic problems that adversely affect adult education outcomes.

METHODS: We analyzed 1554 adults with AML transplanted from MSD (n = 961) or UD (n = 593, HLA-matched 10/10, n = 481; 9/10, n = 112). Compared to MSD, UD recipients were older (49 vs 52 years, p = 0.001), transplanted more recently (2009 vs 2006, p = 0.001), and with a longer interval to transplant (10 vs 9 months, p = 0.001). Conditioning regimen was more frequently myeloablative for patients transplanted with a MSD (61 vs 46 %, p = 0.001). Median follow-up was 28 (range 3-157) months. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil engraftment (p = 0.07), grades II-IV acute GVHD (p = 0.11), chronic GVHD (p = 0.9), and non-relapse mortality (NRM, p = 0.24) was not different according to the type of donor. At 2 years, CI of relapse (relapse incidence (RI)) was 57 vs 49 % (p = 0.001). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 21 vs 26 % (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) was 26 vs 33 % (p = 0.004) for MSD vs UD, respectively. Chronic GVHD as time-dependent variable was associated with lower RI (HR 0.78, p = 0.05), higher NRM (HR 1.71, p = 0.001), and higher OS (HR 0.69, p = 0.001). According to HLA match, RI was 57 vs 50 vs 45 %, (p = 0.001) NRM was 23 vs 23 vs 29 % (p = 0.26), and LFS at 2 years was 21 vs 27 vs 25 % (p = 0.003) for MSD, 10/10, and 9/10 UD, respectively. In multivariate analysis adjusted for differences between the two groups, UD was associated with lower RI (HR 0.76, p = 0.001) and higher LFS (HR 0.83, p = 0.001) compared to MSD. Interval between diagnosis and transplant was the other factor associated with better outcomes (RI (HR 0.62, p < 0.001) and LFS (HR 0.67, p < 0.001)). CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation using UD was associated with better LFS and lower RI compared to MSD for high-risk patients with AML transplanted in first relapse.","['Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Glass, Bertram', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Ruggeri A', 'Battipaglia G', 'Labopin M', 'Ehninger G', 'Beelen D', 'Tischer J', 'Ganser A', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Glass B', 'Finke J', 'Michallet M', 'Stelljes M', 'Jindra P', 'Arnold R', 'Kroger N', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France. annalisaruggeri80@hotmail.com."", ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France."", 'Department of Hematology and Marrow Transplantation, University Federico II of Naples, Naples, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France."", 'Medical Clinic and Polyclinic, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, UH of Munich (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology Helios-Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Schwanebecker Chaussee 50, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Asklepios Hospital St. Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Medicine A, University of Muenster, Munster, Germany.', 'Departments of Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Charite Universitatsmedizin, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75012, Paris, France."", 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris University UPMC, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'ALWP Office, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160917,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Donors', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC5027089,,2016/09/19 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/09/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0321-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0321-y [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 17;9(1):89. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0321-y.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Matched sibling donor', '*Relapse', '*Unrelated donor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus innovative therapeutic strategies with less toxic drugs are of immense need. Moreover combinational effect of redox imbalance with modulated EGFR/PI3K/Akt axis in T-ALL is still elusive. To explore more effective drugs we developed and characterized 5-SMAG, Cu-5-SMAG and Cu-OBPHA complexes by different spectroscopic methods and revealed that introduction of methoxy group and copper to the previously synthesized Schiff base ligand, NG can efficiently target leukemia by sparing the normal cells and overcomes MDR in T-ALL through induction of caspase3 dependent apoptosis as assessed by MTT, Cell-cycle, Annexin-V and caspase3 activation assay. However the ligand 5-SMAG fails to exert significant cytotoxicity. Moreover introduction of copper does not increase the efficacy of the drug molecule as Cu-OBPHA fails to exert significant effect compared to Cu-5-SMAG. Moreover Cu-5-SMAG targets T-ALL cells more than Cu-OBPHA because Cu-5-SMAG generates greater extent of redox imbalance compared to Cu-OBPHA and when this redox imbalance is reduced by application of NAC and PEG-Catalase, highest abrogation of apoptosis is observed following Cu-5-SMAG treatment In addition, Cu-5-SMAG significantly down-regulates the activation and expression of EGFR1, Akt and PI3K in drug-resistant T-ALL cells. Furthermore Cu-5-SMAG significantly increases the life-span of doxorubicin resistant and sensitive Ehrlich ascites carcinoma bearing Swiss albino mice without inducing any significant systemic toxicity compared to 5-SMAG and Cu-OBPHA treatment. Therefore typical architect of Cu-5-SMAG made it a promising new anti-leukemic agent irrespective of the MDR phenotype.","['Banerjee, Kaushik', 'Das, Satyajit', 'Sarkar, Avijit', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Biswas, Jaydip', 'Choudhuri, Soumitra Kumar']","['Banerjee K', 'Das S', 'Sarkar A', 'Chatterjee M', 'Biswas J', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.

The pathophysiology of this disease is just beginning to be understood at the cellular and molecular level, and currently cytogenetic markers are the most important for risk stratification and treatment of AML patients. However, with the advent of new technologies, the detection of other molecular markers such as point mutations and characterization of epigenetic and proteomic profiles, have begun to play an important role in how the disease is approached. Recent evidence shows that the identification of new AML biomarkers contributes to a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, is significantly useful in screening, diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of AML, as well as the possibility of predicting each individual's response to treatment. This review summarizes the most relevant molecular (genetic, epigenetic, and protein) biomarkers associated with acute myeloid leukemia and discusses their clinical importance in terms of risk prediction, diagnosis and prognosis.","['Prada-Arismendy, Jeanette', 'Arroyave, Johanna C', 'Rothlisberger, Sarah']","['Prada-Arismendy J', 'Arroyave JC', 'Rothlisberger S']","['Grupo de Investigacion e Innovacion Biomedica, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano, Medellin, Colombia.

While the original study focussed on drinking water only, this paper also explores alternative exposure pathways including the inhalation of dust and the food chain. U-levels in grass and tissue of sheep generally reflect U-levels in nearby borehole water and exceed background concentrations by 20 to nearly 500 times. U-levels in sheep tissue increase with age of the animal. Wool showed the highest U-concentration followed by other non-consumable tissue such as hooves, teeth and bones. Lower levels occur in edible parts such as meat and inner organs. The U-deposition rate in wool is several orders of magnitudes higher than in bone as a known target organ. Wool is an easy-to-sample non-invasive bioindicator for U-levels in meat. Depending on the original water content, dried samples show up to 5 times higher U-levels than identical fresh material. Contaminated drinking water is the main exposure pathway for farm residents resulting in U-uptake rates exceeding the WHO's tolerable daily intake (TDI) limit by up to 900%. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that U-speciation is dominated by a neutral calcium-uranyl-carbonate complex of relatively low toxicity. Commercially available household filters are able to significantly reduce U-levels in well water and are thus recommended as a short-term intervention. Based on average consumption rates sheep meat, as local staple food, accounts for 34% of the TDI for U. Indoor levels of radon should be monitored, too, since it is linked to both, U and leukaemia. With elevated U-levels being present in other geological formations across South Africa boreholes in these areas should be surveyed.","['Winde, Frank', 'Erasmus, Ewald', 'Geipel, Gerhard']","['Winde F', 'Erasmus E', 'Geipel G']","['Mine Water Re-Search Group, North-West University, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa,.

In this study, we investigated the association between initial body mass index (BMI) and weight loss during HSCT on clinical outcomes in a well-characterised cohort of AML patients. METHODS: We analysed data of the Basel stem-cell transplantation registry ('KMT Kohorte') including all patients with AML undergoing first allogeneic HSCT from January 2003 to January 2014. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for prognostic indicators (European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score and cytogenetics). RESULTS: Mortality in the 156 AML patients (46% female, mean age 46 years) over the 10 years of follow-up was 57%. Compared to patients with a baseline BMI (kg/m2) of 20-25, a low BMI <20 was associated with higher long-term mortality (70 vs. 49%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.97, 95% CI 1.04-3.71, p = 0.036). A more pronounced weight loss during HSCT (>7 vs. <2%) was associated with higher risk for bacterial infections (52 vs. 28%, OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.96-8.18, p = 0.059) and fungal infections (48 vs. 23%, OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.11-10.19, p = 0.032), and longer hospital stays (64 vs. 38 days, adjusted mean difference 25.6 days (15.7-35.5), p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with AML, low initial BMI and more pronounced weight loss during HSCT are strong prognostic indicators associated with lower survival and worse disease outcomes. Intervention research is needed to investigate whether nutritional therapy can reverse these associations.","['Baumgartner, Annic', 'Zueger, Noemi', 'Bargetzi, Annika', 'Medinger, Michael', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Stanga, Zeno', 'Mueller, Beat', 'Bargetzi, Mario', 'Schuetz, Philipp']","['Baumgartner A', 'Zueger N', 'Bargetzi A', 'Medinger M', 'Passweg JR', 'Stanga Z', 'Mueller B', 'Bargetzi M', 'Schuetz P']","['Medical University Department, Clinic for Endocrinology/Metabolism/Clinical Nutrition, Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160917,Switzerland,Ann Nutr Metab,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,8105511,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/therapy', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology/therapy', 'Overweight/epidemiology', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/microbiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Weight Loss']",,,2016/09/19 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2016/09/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000449451 [pii]', '10.1159/000449451 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Nutr Metab. 2016;69(2):89-98. doi: 10.1159/000449451.

While human LL cell lines have generally been found to recapitulate the primary tumors from which they were derived, appropriate characterization including cytogenetic and transcriptional assessment is crucial for assessing their clinical predictive value. RESULTS: In the following study, five canine LL cell lines, CLBL-1, Ema, TL-1 (Nody-1), UL-1, and 3132, were characterized using extensive immunophenotyping, karyotypic analysis, oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (oaCGH), and gene expression profiling. Genome-wide DNA copy number data from the cell lines were also directly compared with 299 primary canine round cell tumors to determine whether the cell lines represent primary tumors, and, if so, what subtype each most closely resembled. CONCLUSIONS: Based on integrated analyses, CLBL-1 was classified as B-cell lymphoma, Ema and TL-1 as T-cell lymphoma, and UL-1 as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 3132, originally classified as a B-cell lymphoma, was reclassified as a histiocytic sarcoma based on characteristic cytogenomic properties. In combination, these data begin to elucidate the clinical predictive value of these cell lines which will enhance the appropriate selection of in vitro models for future studies of canine hematological malignancies.","['Roode, Sarah C', 'Rotroff, Daniel', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Moore, Peter', 'Motsinger-Reif, Alison', 'Okamura, Yasuhiko', 'Mizuno, Takuya', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Suter, Steven E', 'Breen, Matthew']","['Roode SC', 'Rotroff D', 'Richards KL', 'Moore P', 'Motsinger-Reif A', 'Okamura Y', 'Mizuno T', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Suter SE', 'Breen M']","['Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, CVM Research Building - Room 348, 1060 William Moore Drive, Raleigh, 27607, NC, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Comparative Medicine Institute, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Cancer Genetics Program, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'KLR current address: Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Comparative Medicine Institute, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Japan.', 'Comparative Medicine Institute, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA. steven_suter@ncsu.edu.', 'Cancer Genetics Program, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. steven_suter@ncsu.edu.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, CVM Research Building - Room 308, 1051 William Moore Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27607, USA. steven_suter@ncsu.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, CVM Research Building - Room 348, 1060 William Moore Drive, Raleigh, 27607, NC, USA.

However, acquired resistance against imatinib mesylate (IM) has been reported in nearly half of patients and has been recognized as major issue in clinical practice. Multiple resistance genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to be involved in the IM resistance process. These resistance genes and miRNAs tend to interact with each other through a regulatory network. Therefore, it is crucial to study the impact of these interactions in the IM resistance process. The present study focused on miRNA and gene network analysis in order to elucidate the role of interacting elements and to understand their functional contribution in therapeutic failure. Unlike previous studies which were centered only on genes or miRNAs, the prime focus of the present study was on relationships. To this end, three regulatory networks including differentially expressed, related, and global networks were constructed and analyzed in search of similarities and differences. Regulatory associations between miRNAs and their target genes, transcription factors and miRNAs, as well as miRNAs and their host genes were also macroscopically investigated. Certain key pathways in the three networks, especially in the differentially expressed network, were featured. The differentially expressed network emerged as a fault map of IM-resistant CML. Theoretically, the IM resistance process could be prevented by correcting the included errors. The present network-based approach to study resistance miRNAs and genes might help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of IM resistance in CML as well as in the improvement of CML therapy.","['Soltani, Ismael', 'Gharbi, Hanen', 'Hassine, Islem Ben', 'Bouguerra, Ghada', 'Douzi, Kais', 'Teber, Mouheb', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Menif, Samia']","['Soltani I', 'Gharbi H', 'Hassine IB', 'Bouguerra G', 'Douzi K', 'Teber M', 'Abbes S', 'Menif S']","['Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia. soltaniismael@yahoo.fr.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160916,Germany,Funct Integr Genomics,Functional & integrative genomics,100939343,IM,"['Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",,,2016/09/18 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2016/09/18 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10142-016-0520-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10142-016-0520-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Funct Integr Genomics. 2017 May;17(2-3):263-277. doi: 10.1007/s10142-016-0520-1.

As a form of immunotherapy, allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) offers the potential for durable remissions but is limited by transplantation- related morbidity and mortality owing to organ toxicity, infection, and graft-versus-host disease. The recent positive outcomes of chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy in B cell malignancies may herald a paradigm shift in the management of these disorders and perhaps other hematologic malignancies as well. Clinical trials are now needed to address the relative roles of CART cells and HCT in the context of transplantation-eligible patients.

He also tested positive for anti-topoisomerase I antibodies without clinical diagnosis of any connective tissue disease, including systemic sclerosis. Approximately 5 months after the initiation of nilotinib for CML, he developed upper abdominal distension with intermitting abdominal pain, and based on abdominal computed tomography findings, a diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) was made. Five courses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy quickly eliminated the PI and related symptoms without the cessation of nilotinib and, thereafter, additional oral prokinetic agents and non-absorbable antibiotics ensured the non-recurrence of PI. At 6 and 18 months after commencing nilotinib therapy, major and complete molecular response were achieved, respectively. It is suspected that both gastrointestinal hypokinesis related to the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibodies and mucosal permeability due to corticosteroid therapy had existed.

Moreover, zinc is also involved in cellular signaling and enzymes inhibition. Zinc dysregulation, deficiency, over-supply, and imbalance in zinc ion transporters regulation are connected with various diseases including cancer. A zinc ion pool is maintained by two types of proteins: (i) zinc-binding proteins, which act as a buffer and intracellular donors of zinc and (ii) zinc transporters responsible for zinc fluxes into/from cells and organelles. The decreased serum zinc ion levels have been identified in patients suffering from various cancer diseases, including head and neck tumors and breast, prostate, liver, and lung cancer. On the contrary, increased zinc ion levels have been found in breast cancer and other malignant tissues. Zinc metalloproteomes of a majority of tumors including brain ones are still not yet fully understood. Current knowledge show that zinc ion levels and detection of certain zinc-containing proteins may be utilized for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In addition, these proteins can also be promising therapeutic targets. The aim of the present work is an overview of the importance of zinc ions, zinc transporters, and zinc-containing proteins in brain tumors, which are, after leukemia, the second most common type of childhood cancer and the second leading cause of death in children after accidents.","['Hrabeta, Jan', 'Eckschlager, Tomas', 'Stiborova, Marie', 'Heger, Zbynek', 'Krizkova, Sona', 'Adam, Vojtech']","['Hrabeta J', 'Eckschlager T', 'Stiborova M', 'Heger Z', 'Krizkova S', 'Adam V']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Charles University, V Uvalu 84, CZ-150 06, Prague 5, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Charles University, V Uvalu 84, CZ-150 06, Prague 5, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 2030, CZ-128 40, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Zemedelska 1, CZ-613 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Purkynova 123, CZ-612 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Zemedelska 1, CZ-613 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Purkynova 123, CZ-612 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Zemedelska 1, CZ-613 00, Brno, Czech Republic. vojtech.adam@mendelu.cz.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Purkynova 123, CZ-612 00, Brno, Czech Republic. vojtech.adam@mendelu.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160916,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Zinc/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/09/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-016-1454-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-016-1454-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2016 Nov;94(11):1199-1215. doi: 10.1007/s00109-016-1454-8.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to characterize the relationship between venetoclax exposures and efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). METHODS: A total of 272 and 338 patients from four clinical studies were pooled for the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses, respectively. Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and select co-medications were evaluated for their impact on efficacy (lymphocytes, tumor size, objective response [OR]) and safety (neutropenia and infection). RESULTS: Higher venetoclax concentrations led to a more rapid decrease in lymphocyte counts and tumor size, which translated into patients more rapidly achieving OR. The 17p deletion somatic mutation was not identified, in any of the analyses, to affect the responsiveness of patients to venetoclax. Model-based simulations of lymphocyte counts and tumor size estimated an OR rate (ORR) of 84.8 % (95 % confidence interval 81.5-88.0 %) at a venetoclax dosage of 400 mg daily, with minimal increase in ORR at higher doses. The safety analyses of the adverse events (grade 3 or higher) of neutropenia and infection indicated that higher average venetoclax concentrations were not associated with an increase in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The exposure-response analyses indicated that a venetoclax dosage regimen of 400 mg daily results in a high (>80 %) probability of achieving OR in R/R CLL/SLL patients, with minimal probability of increasing neutropenia or infection with higher exposures.","['Freise, Kevin J', 'Jones, Aksana K', 'Eckert, Doerthe', 'Mensing, Sven', 'Wong, Shekman L', 'Humerickhouse, Rod A', 'Awni, Walid M', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Freise KJ', 'Jones AK', 'Eckert D', 'Mensing S', 'Wong SL', 'Humerickhouse RA', 'Awni WM', 'Salem AH']","['Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA. kevin.freise@abbvie.com.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Recurrence', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/18 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/09/18 06:00'],"['2016/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-016-0453-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-016-0453-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2017 May;56(5):515-523. doi: 10.1007/s40262-016-0453-9.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specificities in the management of critically ill neutropenic patients prompted the establishment of guidelines dedicated to intensivists. These recommendations were drawn up by a panel of experts brought together by the French Intensive Care Society in collaboration with the French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care Emergencies, the French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, the French Society of Hematology, the French Society for Hospital Hygiene, and the French Infectious Diseases Society. Literature review and formulation of recommendations were performed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Each recommendation was then evaluated and rated by each expert using a methodology derived from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Six fields are covered by the provided recommendations: (1) ICU admission and prognosis, (2) protective isolation and prophylaxis, (3) management of acute respiratory failure, (4) organ failure and organ support, (5) antibiotic management and source control, and (6) hematological management. Most of the provided recommendations are obtained from low levels of evidence, however, suggesting a need for additional studies. Seven recommendations were, however, associated with high level of evidences and are related to protective isolation, diagnostic workup of acute respiratory failure, medical management, and timing surgery in patients with typhlitis.","['Schnell, David', 'Azoulay, Elie', 'Benoit, Dominique', 'Clouzeau, Benjamin', 'Demaret, Pierre', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Frange, Pierre', 'Lafaurie, Matthieu', 'Legrand, Matthieu', 'Meert, Anne-Pascale', 'Mokart, Djamel', 'Naudin, Jerome', 'Pene, Frederic', 'Rabbat, Antoine', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Ribaud, Patricia', 'Richard, Jean-Christophe', 'Vincent, Francois', 'Zahar, Jean-Ralph', 'Darmon, Michael']","['Schnell D', 'Azoulay E', 'Benoit D', 'Clouzeau B', 'Demaret P', 'Ducassou S', 'Frange P', 'Lafaurie M', 'Legrand M', 'Meert AP', 'Mokart D', 'Naudin J', 'Pene F', 'Rabbat A', 'Raffoux E', 'Ribaud P', 'Richard JC', 'Vincent F', 'Zahar JR', 'Darmon M']","['Angouleme Hospital, Angouleme, France.', 'Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Intensive Care Unit, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Pellegrin University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Chretien, Liege, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematological Unit, Bordeaux University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Microbiology Laboratory & Pediatric Immunology - Hematology Unit, Necker University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Surgical ICU and Burn Unit, Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Thoracic Oncology Department and Oncologic Intensive Care Unit, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France.', 'Pediatric ICU, Robert Debre University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Cochin University Hospital Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, Cochin University Hospital Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Croix Rousse University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Montfermeil Hospital, Montfermeil, France.', 'Infection Control Unit, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'University Hospital, Saint-Etienne, France. michael.darmon@chu-st-etienne.fr.', 'Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Saint-Etienne University Hospital, Avenue Albert Raymond, 42270, Saint-Etienne, Saint-Priest-En-Jarez, France. michael.darmon@chu-st-etienne.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160915,Germany,Ann Intensive Care,Annals of intensive care,101562873,,,PMC5025409,,2016/09/18 06:00,2016/09/18 06:01,['2016/09/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13613-016-0189-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13613-016-0189-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Intensive Care. 2016 Dec;6(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s13613-016-0189-6.

Patients with 17p deletion (del17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia have poor responses and survival after chemoimmunotherapy. We assessed the activity and safety of ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in relapsed or refractory patients with del17p chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS: We did a multicentre, international, open-label, single-arm study at 40 sites in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Patients (age >/=18 years) with previously treated del17p chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma received oral ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response in the all-treated population per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 2008 response criteria modified for treatment-related lymphocytosis. Preplanned exploratory analyses were progression-free survival, overall survival, sustained haematological improvement, and immunological improvement. Patient enrolment is complete, but follow-up is ongoing. Treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events, unacceptable toxicity, or death were collected as a single combined category. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01744691. FINDINGS: Between Jan 29, 2013, and June 19, 2013, 145 patients were enrolled. The all-treated population consisted of 144 patients with del17p chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma who received at least one dose of study drug, with a median age of 64 years (IQR 57-72) and a median of two previous treatments (IQR 1-3). At the prespecified primary analysis after a median follow-up of 11.5 months (IQR 11.1-13.8), 92 (64%, 95% CI 56-71) of 144 patients had an overall response according to independent review committee assessment; 119 patients (83%, 95% CI 76-88) had an overall response according to investigator assessment. In an extended analysis with median follow-up of 27.6 months (IQR 14.6-27.7), the investigator-assessed overall response was reported in 120 patients (83%, 95% CI 76-89). 24-month progression-free survival was 63% (95% CI 54-70) and 24-month overall survival was 75% (67-81). Sustained haematological improvement was noted in 72 (79%) of 91 patients with any baseline cytopenia. No clinically relevant changes were noted from baseline to 6 months or 24 months in IgA (median 0.4 g/L at baseline, 0.6 g/L at 6 months, and 0.7 g/L at 24 months), IgG (5.0 g/L, 5.3 g/L, and 4.9 g/L), or IgM (0.3 g/L at each timepoint) concentrations. Common reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease in 34 (24%) patients and adverse events, unacceptable toxicity, or death in 24 (17%) patients. Major bleeding occurred in 13 (9%) patients (11 [8%] grade 3-4). Grade 3 or worse infections occurred in 43 (30%) patients, including pneumonia in 19 (13%) patients. In the extended analysis, 38 patients died, 18 as a result of adverse events (four pneumonia, three chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, two Richter's syndrome, two sepsis, and one each of acute myocardial infarction, septic shock, encephalopathy, general deterioration in physical health, abnormal hepatic function, myocardial infarction, and renal infarction). INTERPRETATION: A high proportion of patients had an overall response to ibrutinib and the risk:benefit profile was favourable, providing further evidence for use of ibrutinib in the most difficult subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Ibrutinib represents a clinical advance in the treatment of patients with del17p chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and has been incorporated into treatment algorithms as a primary treatment for these patients.

The effect of daratumumab on CLL cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix was characterized. Daratumumab activity was validated in two in vivo models.Results: Daratumumab demonstrated efficient lysis of patient-derived CLL cells and cell lines by ADCC in vitro and ADCP both in vitro and in vivo whereas exhibited negligible CDC in these cells. To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of daratumumab in CLL, we generated a disseminated CLL mouse model with the CD38(+) MEC2 cell line and CLL patient-derived xenografts (CLL-PDX). Daratumumab significantly prolonged overall survival of MEC2 mice, completely eliminated cells from the infiltrated organs, and significantly reduced disease burden in the spleen of CLL-PDX. The effect of daratumumab on patient-derived CLL cell dissemination was demonstrated in vitro by its effect on CXCL12-induced migration and in vivo by interfering with CLL cell homing to spleen in NSG mice. Daratumumab also reduced adhesion of CLL cells to VCAM-1, accompanied by downregulation of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9.Conclusions: These unique and substantial effects of daratumumab on CLL viability and dissemination support the investigation of its use in a clinical setting of CLL.

Although it has been reported that overexpression of miR-125b leads to T-ALL development, the underlying mechanisms of miR-125b action are still unclear. The goal of this study is to delineate the role of miR-125b in T-ALL development. We found that miR-125b is highly expressed in undifferentiated leukemic T cells (CD4-negative) while its expression is low in differentiated T cells (CD4-positive). Overexpression of miR-125b increased the CD4-negative population in T cells, whereas depletion of miR-125b by miR-125b-sponge decreased the CD4-negative cell population. We identified that A20 (TNFAIP3) is a direct target of miR-125b in T cells. Overexpression of miR-125b also increased glucose uptake and oxygen consumption in T cells through targeting A20. Furthermore, restoration of A20 in miR-125b-overexpressing cells decreased the CD4-negative population in T cell leukemia, and decreased glucose uptake and oxygen consumption to the basal level of T cells transfected with vector. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-125b regulates differentiation and reprogramming of T cell glucose metabolism via targeting A20. Since both de-differentiation and dysregulated glucose metabolism contribute to the development of T-cell leukemia, these findings provide novel insights into the understanding and treatment of T-ALL.","['Liu, Zixing', 'Smith, Kelly R', 'Khong, Hung T', 'Huang, Jingshan', 'Ahn, Eun-Young Erin', 'Zhou, Ming', 'Tan, Ming']","['Liu Z', 'Smith KR', 'Khong HT', 'Huang J', 'Ahn EE', 'Zhou M', 'Tan M']","['Mitchell Cancer Institute, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Mitchell Cancer Institute, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'School of Computing, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Mitchell Cancer Institute, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Mitchell Cancer Institute, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cellular Reprogramming', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5346668,,2016/09/17 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['12018 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12018 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 29;7(48):78667-78679. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12018.,"['R01 CA149646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA180982/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['A20', 'T cell', 'differentiation', 'lymphocytic leukemia', 'miR-125b']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrations in CRLF2 activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway that contributes to B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The prognostic significance of CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in various B-ALL risk subgroups has not been well established. Two hundred seventy-one patients with newly diagnosed childhood B-ALL were enrolled from a Chinese population. The prevalence of CRLF2 overexpression, CRLF2-P2RY8 fusion, CRLF2 F232C mutation, and JAK2 and IL7R mutational status were analyzed, and the prognostic impact of CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 on B-ALL was evaluated by assessing their influence on overall survival and event-free survival. CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 were found in 19% and 10%, respectively, in the whole cohort. No correlation between CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 was observed. CRLF2 F322C and IL7R mutations were not detected in B-ALL cases overexpressing CRLF2, and no JAK2 mutations were found in the whole cohort either. The results showed that CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 were associated with a poor outcome in unselected B-ALL. Moreover, in an intermediate risk B-ALL subgroup P2RY8-CRLF2 was correlated with worse survival, whereas in high- and low-risk subgroups, CRLF2 overexpression predicted a poor outcome. Our findings suggest that P2RY8-CRLF2 is an independent prognostic indicator in intermediate risk B-ALL, while CRLF2 overexpression is correlated with an inferior outcome in high- or low-risk B-ALL. Our study demonstrates that the impact of P2RY8-CRLF2 and CRLF2 overexpression on B-ALL survival may differ across risk subgroups.

Resulting in constitutive activation of the kinase, FLT3/ITD portends a particularly poor prognosis, with reduced overall survival and increased rates of relapse. We previously generated a knock-in mouse, harboring an internal tandem duplication at the endogenous Flt3 locus, which develops a fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), but fails to develop acute leukemia, suggesting additional mutations are necessary for transformation. To investigate the potential cooperativity of FLT3/ITD and mutant DNMT3A, we bred a conditional Dnmt3a knockout to a substrain of our Flt3/ITD knock-in mice, and found deletion of Dnmt3a significantly reduced median survival of Flt3ITD/+ mice in a dose dependent manner. As expected, pIpC treated Flt3ITD/+ mice solely developed MPN, while Flt3ITD/+;Dnmt3af/f and Flt3ITD/+;Dnmt3af/+ developed a spectrum of neoplasms, including MPN, T-ALL, and AML. Functionally, FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A deletion cooperate to expand LT-HSCs, which exhibit enhanced self-renewal in serial re-plating assays. These results illustrate that DNMT3A loss cooperates with FLT3/ITD to generate hematopoietic neoplasms, including AML. In combination with FLT3/ITD, homozygous Dnmt3a knock-out results in reduced time to disease onset, LT-HSC expansion, and a higher incidence of T-ALL compared with loss of just one allele. The co-occurrence of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations in AML, as well as subsets of T-ALL, suggests the Flt3ITD/+;Dnmt3af/f model may serve as a valuable resource for delineating effective therapeutic strategies in two clinically relevant contexts.","['Poitras, Jennifer L', 'Heiser, Diane', 'Li, Li', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Nagai, Kozo', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Gamper, Christopher', 'Small, Donald']","['Poitras JL', 'Heiser D', 'Li L', 'Nguyen B', 'Nagai K', 'Duffield AS', 'Gamper C', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC5342464,,2016/09/17 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11986 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11986 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 25;7(43):69124-69135. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11986.,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT3a', 'FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'internal tandem duplication', 'mouse model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Del(9q) can be found as the sole abnormality or in combination with other cytogenetic aberrations such as t(8;21) and t(15;17). TLE1 and TLE4 were identified to be critical genes contained in the 9q region. We performed whole exome sequencing of 5 patients with del(9q) as the sole abnormality followed by targeted amplicon sequencing of 137 genes of 26 patients with del(9q) as sole or combined with other aberrations. We detected frequent mutations in NPM1 (10/26; 38%), DNMT3A (8/26; 31%), and WT1 (8/26; 31%) but only few FLT3-ITDs (2/26; 8%). All mutations affecting NPM1 and DNMT3A were exclusively identified in patients with del(9q) as the sole abnormality and were significantly more frequent compared to 111 patients classified as intermediate-II according to the European LeukemiaNet (10/14, 71% vs. 22/111, 20%; P < 0.001, 8/14, 57% vs. 26/111, 23%; P = 0.02). Furthermore, we identified DNMT3B to be rarely but recurrently targeted by truncating mutations in AML. Gene expression analysis of 13 patients with del(9q) and 454 patients with normal karyotype or various cytogenetic aberrations showed significant down regulation of TLE4 in patients with del(9q) (P = 0.02). Interestingly, downregulation of TLE4 was not limited to AML with del(9q), potentially representing a common mechanism in AML pathogenesis. Our comprehensive genetic analysis of the del(9q) subgroup reveals a unique mutational profile with the frequency of DNMT3A mutations in the del(9q) only subset being the highest reported so far in AML, indicating oncogenic cooperativity.

Efforts to elucidate the role they play in these malignancies have led to important diagnostic and therapeutic triumphs, including the famous development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib targeting the BCR-ABL fusion. Until recently, there has been a paucity of research investigating fusion proteins harbored by head and neck neoplasms. The discovery and characterization of novel fusion proteins in neoplasms originating from the thyroid, nasopharynx, salivary glands, and midline head and neck structures offer substantial contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis and biological behavior of these neoplasms, while raising new therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities. Further characterization of these fusion proteins promises to facilitate advances on par with those already achieved with regard to hematologic malignancies in the precise, molecularly guided diagnosis and treatment of head and neck neoplasms. The following is a subsite specific review of the clinical implications of fusion proteins in head and neck neoplasms and the future potential for diagnostic targeting.","['Escalante, Derek A', 'Wang, He', 'Fundakowski, Christopher E']","['Escalante DA', 'Wang H', 'Fundakowski CE']","['a Temple University Katz School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Temple University Katz School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine , Temple University , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'a Temple University Katz School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'c Department of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery , Temple University , Philadelphia , PA , USA.', 'd Department of Surgical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , PA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160916,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,,,PMC5079396,,2016/09/17 06:00,2016/09/17 06:01,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/17 06:01 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1219823 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Oct 2;17(10):995-1002. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1219823.

T-ALL arises in the thymus from an immature thymocyte as a consequence of a stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Crucial biological processes, such as differentiation, self-renewal capacity, proliferation, and apoptosis, are targeted and deranged by several types of neoplasia-associated genetic alteration, for example, translocations, deletions, and mutations of genes that code for proteins involved in signaling transduction, epigenetic regulation, and transcription. Epigenetically, T-ALL is characterized by gene expression changes caused by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, histone modifications, and miRNA and lncRNA abnormalities. Although some genetic and gene expression patterns have been associated with certain clinical features, such as immunophenotypic subtype and outcome, none has of yet generally been implemented in clinical routine for treatment decisions. The recent advent of massive parallel sequencing technologies has dramatically increased our knowledge of the genetic blueprint of T-ALL, revealing numerous fusion genes as well as novel gene mutations. The challenges now are to integrate all genetic and epigenetic data into a coherent understanding of the pathogenesis of T-ALL and to translate the wealth of information gained in the last few years into clinical use in the form of improved risk stratification and targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of pediatric T-ALL with an emphasis on the acquired genetic alterations that result in this disease.

Despite the pervasiveness of this phenotype, knowledge of pathways that drive fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in cancer is limited. Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins hydroxylate substrate proline residues and have been linked to fuel switching. Here, we reveal that PHD3 rapidly triggers repression of FAO in response to nutrient abundance via hydroxylation of acetyl-coA carboxylase 2 (ACC2). We find that PHD3 expression is strongly decreased in subsets of cancer including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is linked to a reliance on fat catabolism regardless of external nutrient cues. Overexpressing PHD3 limits FAO via regulation of ACC2 and consequently impedes leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, loss of PHD3 enables greater utilization of fatty acids but may also serve as a metabolic and therapeutic liability by indicating cancer cell susceptibility to FAO inhibition.","['German, Natalie J', 'Yoon, Haejin', 'Yusuf, Rushdia Z', 'Murphy, J Patrick', 'Finley, Lydia W S', 'Laurent, Gaelle', 'Haas, Wilhelm', 'Satterstrom, F Kyle', 'Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Zaganjor, Elma', 'Santos, Daniel', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Beck, Andrew H', 'Gygi, Steven P', 'Scadden, David T', 'Kaelin, William G Jr', 'Haigis, Marcia C']","['German NJ', 'Yoon H', 'Yusuf RZ', 'Murphy JP', 'Finley LW', 'Laurent G', 'Haas W', 'Satterstrom FK', 'Guarnerio J', 'Zaganjor E', 'Santos D', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Beck AH', 'Gygi SP', 'Scadden DT', 'Kaelin WG Jr', 'Haigis MC']","['Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138; Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138; Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Imatinib uptake into targeted cells is crucial for its molecular response and clinical effectiveness. The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) has been proposed to be responsible for this process, but its relevance has been discussed controversially in recent times. Here we found that the multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) transports imatinib with a manifold higher affinity. MATE1 mainly mediates the cellular uptake of imatinib into targeted cells and thereby controls the intracellular effectiveness of imatinib. Importantly, MATE1 but not OCT1 expression is reduced in total bone marrow cells of imatinib-non-responding CML patients compared with imatinib-responding patients, indicating that MATE1 but not OCT1 determines the therapeutic success of imatinib. We thus propose that imatinib non-responders could be identified early before starting therapy by measuring MATE1 expression levels.","['Harrach, S', 'Schmidt-Lauber, C', 'Pap, T', 'Pavenstadt, H', 'Schlatter, E', 'Schmidt, E', 'Berdel, W E', 'Schulze, U', 'Edemir, B', 'Jeromin, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Ciarimboli, G', 'Bertrand, J']","['Harrach S', 'Schmidt-Lauber C', 'Pap T', 'Pavenstadt H', 'Schlatter E', 'Schmidt E', 'Berdel WE', 'Schulze U', 'Edemir B', 'Jeromin S', 'Haferlach T', 'Ciarimboli G', 'Bertrand J']","['Institute of Experimental Musculoskeletal Medicine, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Experimental Nephrology, Medizinische Klinik D, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Musculoskeletal Medicine, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Molecular Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine D, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Experimental Nephrology, Medizinische Klinik D, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Molecular Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine D, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Clinic and Polyclinic of Internal Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Halle, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munchen, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munchen, Germany.', 'Experimental Nephrology, Medizinische Klinik D, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Musculoskeletal Medicine, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160916,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference']",PMC5056971,"['TH partly owns MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory.

However, multiple options exist beyond standard fractionated whole breast irradiation including hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HFRT), accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), and endocrine therapy (ET) alone, which can limit treatment duration, and potentially reduce morbidity and cost. Limited data are available on the percentage of patients eligible for these alternatives; therefore, a Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) analysis was performed to assess candidacy for these alternative options in women with early stage breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women treated for breast cancer between the years of 2010 and 2012 were identified in the SEER database. Patients with unknown staging, metastatic disease, T3/T4 disease, and >/=N1 disease were excluded. Patients were defined as eligible for HFRT based on the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus guidelines and randomised trial testing intensity modulated and partial organ radiotherapy following breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer (IMPORT LOW) trial criteria, APBI based on the ASTRO, American Brachytherapy Society and the Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie of European Society for Therapeutic Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) consensus guidelines, and GEC-ESTRO APBI and IMPORT LOW trial criteria, and ET alone based on the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 and Post-operative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly II inclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 108,484 women with early stage breast cancer who met the aforementioned inclusion criteria were identified. Of these patients, 86,896 (80.1%) were eligible for HFRT based on ASTRO consensus guidelines and 81,459 (75.0%) based on IMPORT LOW trial criteria. Regarding APBI, 44,797 (41.2%), 81,020 (74.6%), 81,020 (74.6%) were eligible according to ASTRO, ABS, GEC-ESTRO consensus guidelines, respectively, 97,301 (89.7%) patients according to the GEC-ESTRO trial criteria, and 81,459 (75.0%) patients according to the IMPORT LOW trial criteria. For ET alone, 23,006 (21.2%) were eligible according to Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 criteria and 42,104 (38.8%) according to Post-operative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly II criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This SEER analysis demonstrates that a substantial proportion of women with early stage breast cancer are eligible for HFRT, APBI, or ET alone after breast conserving surgery according to consensus guidelines and prospective trial criteria. With incorporation of additional pathologic, dosimetric, and chemotherapy data, quality assurance pathways may use such data to help ensure patients are receiving appropriate risk stratified treatment recommendations.","['Manyam, Bindu V', 'Tendulkar, Rahul', 'Cherian, Sheen', 'Vicini, Frank', 'Badiyan, Shahed N', 'Shah, Chirag']","['Manyam BV', 'Tendulkar R', 'Cherian S', 'Vicini F', 'Badiyan SN', 'Shah C']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', '21st Century Oncology, Michigan Healthcare Professionals, Farmington Hills, MI.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', '*Brachytherapy', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Dose Hypofractionation', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/17 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/COC.0000000000000332 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2018 Jun;41(6):526-531. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000332.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Questionnaire and medical record data from 515 AYA cancer patients (21 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 201 germ cell tumor, 141 Hodgkin lymphoma, 128 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 24 sarcoma) from a population-based study were analyzed. We used multivariable models to determine characteristics associated with patient knowledge of the availability of clinical trials for their cancer. Reasons for not participating in a trial were tabulated. RESULTS: In total, 63% of patients reported not knowing whether a relevant clinical trial was available, 20% reported knowing that a clinical trial was not available, and 17% reported that a trial was available. Among patients reporting an available trial, 67% were recommended for enrollment. Knowing about the availability of clinical trials was associated with having ALL (odds ratio=2.9, 95% confidence interval=1.1, 7.8). Reporting that a clinical trial was available was positively associated with having ALL, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and sarcoma (relative to germ cell tumor) and working full-time or in school full-time (odds ratio=2.6, 95% confidence interval=1.0, 6.7). Concerns about involvement in research (57%) and problems accessing trials (21%) were the primary reasons cited for not enrolling among patients who knew that a trial was available. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in AYA cancer patient clinical trial enrollment will require enhancing knowledge about trial availability and addressing this population's concerns about participating in medical research.","['Shnorhavorian, Margarett', 'Doody, David R', 'Chen, Vivien W', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Kato, Ikuko', 'Cress, Rosemary D', 'West, Michele', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Schwartz, Stephen M']","['Shnorhavorian M', 'Doody DR', 'Chen VW', 'Hamilton AS', 'Kato I', 'Cress RD', 'West M', 'Wu XC', 'Keegan THM', 'Harlan LC', 'Schwartz SM']","[""Department of Urology, Division of Pediatric Urology, University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital."", 'Epidemiology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Epidemiology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA.', 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.', 'Departments of Oncology and Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA.', 'Applied Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Epidemiology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', '*Patient Participation', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/17 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/COC.0000000000000327 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2018 Jun;41(6):581-587. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000327.,['K12 HD053984/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['AYA HOPE Study Collaborative Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The condition may mimic bacterial appendicitis and the less serious condition, typhlitis. The disease demands prompt surgical debulking and aggressive antifungal treatment. However, surgery is delayed due to the poor performance status and severe neutropenia. This may lead to perforative peritonitis and further dissemination. The survival rates of such disease are dismal. Unfortunately, the diagnosis may be confirmed only on histological examination of the surgically excised tissue.

Administration of chemical compounds influencing apoptosis and T cell development has been discussed as promising novel therapeutic strategies. Valproic acid (VPA) as a recently emerged anti-neoplastic histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and pioglitazone (PGZ) as a high-affinity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist have been shown to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in different studies. Here, we aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in anti-proliferative effects of these compounds on human Jurkat cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treated cells were evaluated for cell cycle progression and apoptosis using flowcytometry and MTT viability assay. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out to measure the alterations in key genes associated with cell death and cell cycle arrest. RESULTS: Our findings illustrated that both VPA and PGZ can inhibit Jurkat E6.1 cells in vitro after 24 hr; however, PGZ 400 muM presents the most anti-proliferative effect. Interestingly, treated cells have been arrested in G2/M with deregulated cell division cycle 25A (Cdc25A) phosphatase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B or p27) expression. Expression of cyclin D1 gene was inhibited when DNA synthesis entry was declined. Cell cycle deregulation in PGZ and VPA-exposed cells generated an increase in the proportion of aneuploid cell population, which has not reported before. CONCLUSION: These findings define that anti-proliferative effects of PGZ and VPA on Jurkat cell line are mediated by cell cycle deregulation. Thus, we suggest PGZ and VPA may relieve potential therapeutic application against apoptosis-resistant malignancies.","['Jazi, Marie Saghaeian', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Yazdani, Yaghoub', 'Sedighi, Sima', 'Memarian, Ali', 'Aghaei, Mehrdad']","['Jazi MS', 'Mohammadi S', 'Yazdani Y', 'Sedighi S', 'Memarian A', 'Aghaei M']","['Student Research Committee, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran; Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran; Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Infectious Diseases Research Center and Laboratory Science Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Joint, Bone, and Connective tissue Research Center (JBCRC), Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Joint, Bone, and Connective tissue Research Center (JBCRC), Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,PMC5010851,,2016/09/17 06:00,2016/09/17 06:01,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2016 Jul;19(7):779-86.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pioglitazone', 'Proliferation', 'T-cell leukemia', 'Valproic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 95 Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, the normal control group (A), the methotrexate (MTX) control group (B), the IL-11-pre-treated high-dose group (C), the post-IL-11-treatment high-dose group (D) and the post-IL-11-treatment low-dose group (E). After the intraperitoneal injection of MTX in the groups B-E, the rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The mortality, morphological and ultrastructural changes of small intestine of each group were observed. The cells were then cultured in vitro, and the MTT method was used to investigate the effects of different concentration of IL-11 on CEM proliferation and also on HDMTX-induced mucositis. RESULTS: IL-11 could reduce the intestinal histopathological score, increase the height of small intestinal villi, promote the proliferation of intestinal lacunar cells and reduce the mortality rate of rats. The IL-11 pre-treatment group exhibited the best efficacies, demonstrating significant difference with the control group (P<0.01). In addition, the proliferation of CEM was not promoted, indicating that IL-11 could not inhibit HDMTX.

These cargo proteins include tumor suppressors and growth-regulatory factors and as such XPO1 is considered a potential anti-cancer target. From this perspective, inhibition of the XPO1-mediated nuclear export by selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds has shown broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity. Furthermore, the clinical candidate SINE, selinexor, is currently in multiple phase I/II/IIb trials for treatment of cancer. Resistance against selinexor has not yet been observed in the clinic, but in vitro selection of resistance did not reveal any mutations in the target protein, XPO1. However, introduction of a homozygous mutation at the drug's target site, the cysteine 528 residue inside the XPO1 cargo-binding pocket, by genetic engineering, confers resistance to selinexor. Here we investigated whether this resistance to selinexor is recessive or dominant. For this purpose we have engineered multiple leukemia cell lines containing heterozygous or homozygous C528S substitutions using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Our findings show that heterozygous mutation confers similar resistance against selinexor as homozygous substitution, demonstrating that SINE resistance can be obtained by a single and dominant mutation of the cysteine528 residue in XPO1.","['Neggers, Jasper Edgar', 'Vanstreels, Els', 'Baloglu, Erkan', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Landesman, Yosef', 'Daelemans, Dirk']","['Neggers JE', 'Vanstreels E', 'Baloglu E', 'Shacham S', 'Landesman Y', 'Daelemans D']","['Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Newton, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Newton, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Newton, MA, USA.', 'Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Survival', 'Cysteine/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Editing', 'Genetic Engineering', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyopherins/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics']",PMC5356594,,2016/09/17 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11995 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11995 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 18;7(42):68842-68850. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11995.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'CRM1', 'SINE', 'XPO1', 'nuclear export']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of peripheral blood APL cells from patients complicated with vs. without DS were integratively analyzed to explore the mechanisms underlying arsenic trioxide treatment-associated DS. By integrating the differentially expressed data with the data of differentially expressed microRNAs and their computationally predicted target genes, as well as the data of transcription factors and differentially expressed target microRNAs obtained from a literature search, a DS-related genetic regulatory network was constructed. Then using an EAGLE algorithm in clusterViz, the network was subdivided into 10 modules. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database the modules were annotated functionally, and three functionally active modules were recognized. The further in-depth analyses on the annotated functions of the three modules and the expression and roles of the related genes revealed that proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and infiltration capability of APL cells might play important roles in the DS pathogenesis. The results could improve our understanding of DS pathogenesis from a more overall perspective, and could provide new clues for future research.","['Zhang, Yingmei', 'Hou, Jinxiao', 'Ge, Fei', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Li, Haitao', 'Wang, Ping', 'Xu, Mengyuan', 'Song, Peng', 'Li, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Shuye', 'Li, Jinmei', 'Han, Xueying', 'Zhao, Yanhong', 'Su, Yanhua', 'Li, Yinghua', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Li, Limin', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Zhang Y', 'Hou J', 'Ge F', 'Cao F', 'Li H', 'Wang P', 'Xu M', 'Song P', 'Li X', 'Wang S', 'Li J', 'Han X', 'Zhao Y', 'Su Y', 'Li Y', 'Fan S', 'Li L', 'Zhou J']","['Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Neonatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcriptome']",PMC5341995,,2016/09/17 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11989 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11989 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):73509-73524. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11989.,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'differentiation syndrome', 'mRNA', 'microRNA', 'microarrays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various models recapitulate these microenvironments in vitro, such as stimulation with CD154 and IL4. Using this system, we observed a 30- to 40-fold induction of wild-type p53 protein in 50 distinct human CLL specimens tested, without the induction of either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, the mRNA levels for p53 did not increase, indicating that its elevation occurred posttranscriptionally. Mechanistic investigations revealed that under the conditions studied, p53 was phosphorylated on residues associated with p53 activation and increased half-life. However, p53 protein induced in this manner could transcriptionally activate only a subset of target genes. The addition of a DNA-damaging agent further upregulated p53 protein levels, which led to apoptosis. p53 induction relied on the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species observed after CD154 and IL4 stimulation. We propose that chronic oxidative stress is a characteristic of the microenvironment in B-cell ""proliferation centers"" in CLL that are capable of elevating the basal expression of p53, but to levels below the threshold needed to induce arrest or apoptosis. Our findings suggest that reactivation of the full transcriptional activities of p53 in proliferating CLL cells may offer a possible therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 76(21); 6311-9.

We further characterized this type of fusion gene by whole transcriptome sequencing and/or polymerase chain reaction. In addition to previously reported genes, we identified BMP2K as a novel fusion partner for ZNF384 Including the EP300-ZNF384 that we reported recently, the total frequency of ZNF384-related fusion genes was 4.1% in 291 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients enrolled in a single clinical trial, and TCF3-ZNF384 was the most recurrent, with a frequency of 2.4%. The characteristic immunophenotype of weak CD10 and aberrant CD13 and/or CD33 expression was revealed to be a common feature of the leukemic cells harboring ZNF384-related fusion genes. The signature gene expression profile in TCF3-ZNF384-positive patients was enriched in hematopoietic stem cell features and related to that of EP300-ZNF384-positive patients, but was significantly distinct from that of TCF3-PBX1-positive and ZNF384-fusion-negative patients. However, clinical features of TCF3-ZNF384-positive patients are markedly different from those of EP300-ZNF384-positive patients, exhibiting higher cell counts and a younger age at presentation. TCF3-ZNF384-positive patients revealed a significantly poorer steroid response and a higher frequency of relapse, and the additional activating mutations in RAS signaling pathway genes were detected by whole exome analysis in some of the cases. Our observations indicate that ZNF384-related fusion genes consist of a distinct subgroup of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a characteristic immunophenotype, while the clinical features depend on the functional properties of individual fusion partners.","['Hirabayashi, Shinsuke', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko', 'Ichikawa, Hitoshi', 'Momozawa, Yukihide', 'Okamura,

Identification of risk-modifying conditions will help tailor preventative strategies. This study aims to quantify the associations of hematologic malignancies and solid cancers with red cell alloimmunization in patients receiving red cell transfusions. We performed a nested multicenter case-control study in a source population of 24,063 patients receiving their first and subsequent red cell transfusions during an 8-year follow-up period. Cases (n=505), defined as patients developing a first transfusion-induced red cell alloantibody, were each compared with 2 non-alloimmunized controls (n=1010) who received a similar number of red cell units. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, we evaluated the association of various malignancies and treatment regimens with alloimmunization during a delineated 5-week risk period. The incidence of alloimmunization among patients with acute (myeloid or lymphoid) leukemia and mature (B- or T-cell) lymphoma was significantly reduced compared to patients without these malignancies: adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 (range 0.19-0.68) and 0.30 (range 0.12-0.81). Associations were primarily explained by immunosuppressive treatments [RR for (any type of) chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy 0.27 (95%CI: 0.09-0.83)]. Alloimmunization risks were similarly diminished in allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplanted patients (RR 0.34, 95%CI: 0.16-0.74), at least during the six months post transplant. Alloimmunization risks of patients with other hematologic diseases or solid cancers, and their associated treatment regimens were similar to risks in the general transfused population. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to malignancies in general, hemato-oncological patients treated with dose-intensive regimens have strongly diminished risk of red cell alloimmunization.","['Evers, Dorothea', 'Zwaginga, Jaap Jan', 'Tijmensen, Janneke', 'Middelburg, Rutger A', 'de Haas, Masja', 'de Vooght, Karen M K', 'van de Kerkhof, Daan', 'Visser, Otto', 'Pequeriaux, Nathalie C V', 'Hudig, Francisca', 'van der Bom, Johanna G']","['Evers D', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Tijmensen J', 'Middelburg RA', 'de Haas M', 'de Vooght KM', 'van de Kerkhof D', 'Visser O', 'Pequeriaux NC', 'Hudig F', 'van der Bom JG']","['Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immuno-hematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immuno-hematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immuno-hematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immuno-hematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology Diagnostics, Sanquin, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Jeroen Bosch Hospital, 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands."", 'LabWest, Haga Teaching Hospital, The Hague, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands j.g.vanderbom@lumc.nl.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160915,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*immunology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Isoantibodies/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*immunology/*therapy', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5210232,,2016/09/17 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/09/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.152074 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.152074 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jan;102(1):52-59. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.152074.

Risks for specific SN types vary substantially, with particularly elevated risks for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, and squamous cell malignancies. This document provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding SN after HCT and recommends priorities and approaches to overcome challenges and gaps in understanding. Numerous factors have been suggested to affect risk, including patient-related (eg, age), primary disease-related (eg, disease type, pre-HCT therapies), and HCT-related characteristics (eg, type and intensity of conditioning regimen, stem cell source, development of graft-versus-host disease). However, gaps in understanding remain for each of these risk factors, particularly for patients receiving HCT in the current era because of substantial advances in clinical transplantation practices. Additionally, the influence of nontransplantation-related risk factors (eg, germline genetic susceptibility, oncogenic viruses, lifestyle factors) is poorly understood. Clarification of the magnitude of SN risks and identification of etiologic factors will require large-scale, long-term, systematic follow-up of HCT survivors with detailed clinical data. Most investigations of the mechanisms of SN pathogenesis after HCT have focused on immune drivers. Expansion of our understanding in this area will require interdisciplinary laboratory collaborations utilizing measures of immune function and availability of archival tissue from SN diagnoses. Consensus-based recommendations for optimal preventive, screening, and therapeutic approaches have been developed for certain SN after HCT, whereas for other SN, general population guidelines are recommended. Further evidence is needed to specifically tailor preventive, screening, and therapeutic guidelines for SN after HCT, particularly for unique patient populations. Accomplishment of this broad research agenda will require increased investment in systematic data collection with engagement from patients, clinicians, and interdisciplinary scientists to reduce the burden of SN in the rapidly growing population of HCT survivors.","['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Saber, Wael', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Barrett, A John', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Engels, Eric A', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Kleiner, David E', 'Pavletic, Steven', 'Burns, Linda J']","['Morton LM', 'Saber W', 'Baker KS', 'Barrett AJ', 'Bhatia S', 'Engels EA', 'Gadalla SM', 'Kleiner DE', 'Pavletic S', 'Burns LJ']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

Treatment for post-HCT relapse using donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has limited utility, particularly in the setting of acute leukemia, and can result in the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene product is a tumor-associated antigen that is expressed in acute leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, with limited expression in normal tissues. In this pilot trial, we assessed safety and feasibility of a WT1 peptide-loaded donor-derived dendritic cell (DC) vaccine given with DLI designed to enhance and direct the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Secondary objectives were to evaluate immunologic and clinical responses. A total of 5 subjects, median age 17 years (range, 9 to 19 years), with post-HCT relapse were enrolled. Disease subtypes included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 1), and Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1). Successful vaccine production was feasible from all donors. DC vaccination and DLI were well tolerated. One recipient developed grade 1 skin GVHD not requiring systemic therapy. The most common adverse events included grade 1 reversible pain and pruritus at the vaccine injection and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing sites. There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events related to the research. Immune responses consisted of ELISpot response in 3 recipients and positive DTH tests to WT1 peptide cocktail in 2 subjects. Our study provides 1 of the first attempts to apply tumor-specific vaccine therapy to the allogeneic setting. Preliminary results show the DC-based vaccination is safe and feasible after allogeneic HCT, with a suggestion that this approach can be used to sensitize the repopulated allogeneic-donor immune system to WT1. Future directions may include testing of vaccination strategies in the early post-transplantation setting for relapse prevention.","['Shah, Nirali N', 'Loeb, David M', 'Khuu, Hahn', 'Stroncek, David', 'Ariyo, Tolu', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Delbrook, Cindy', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Shah NN', 'Loeb DM', 'Khuu H', 'Stroncek D', 'Ariyo T', 'Raffeld M', 'Delbrook C', 'Mackall CL', 'Wayne AS', 'Fry TJ']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

METHODS: We performed an extensive biologic characterization of newly diagnosed CLL, including NGS analysis of 20 genes frequently mutated in CLL and karyotype analysis to assess whether NGS and karyotype results could be of clinical relevance in the refinement of prognosis and assessment of risk of progression. The genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples of 200 consecutive CLL patients was analyzed using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, a NGS platform that uses semiconductor sequencing technology. Karyotype analysis was performed using efficient mitogens. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in 42.0 % of cases with 42.8 % of mutated patients presenting 2 or more mutations. The presence of mutations by NGS was associated with unmutated IGHV gene (p = 0.009), CD38 positivity (p = 0.010), risk stratification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (p < 0.001), and the complex karyotype (p = 0.003). A high risk as assessed by FISH analysis was associated with mutations affecting TP53 (p = 0.012), BIRC3 (p = 0.003), and FBXW7 (p = 0.003) while the complex karyotype was significantly associated with TP53, ATM, and MYD88 mutations (p = 0.003, 0.018, and 0.001, respectively). By multivariate analysis, the multi-hit profile (>/=2 mutations by NGS) was independently associated with a shorter time to first treatment (p = 0.004) along with TP53 disruption (p = 0.040), IGHV unmutated status (p < 0.001), and advanced stage (p < 0.001). Advanced stage (p = 0.010), TP53 disruption (p < 0.001), IGHV unmutated status (p = 0.020), and the complex karyotype (p = 0.007) were independently associated with a shorter overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, an extensive biologic characterization including NGS and karyotype analyses using novel mitogens may offer new perspectives for a better refinement of risk stratification that could be of help in the clinical management of CLL patients.","['Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Saccenti, Elena', 'Bassi, Cristian', 'Lupini, Laura', 'Quaglia, Francesca Maria', 'Cavallari, Maurizio', 'Martinelli, Sara', 'Formigaro, Luca', 'Lista, Enrico', 'Bardi, Maria Antonella', 'Volta, Eleonora', 'Tammiso, Elisa', 'Melandri, Aurora', 'Urso, Antonio', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Cuneo, Antonio']","['Rigolin GM', 'Saccenti E', 'Bassi C', 'Lupini L', 'Quaglia FM', 'Cavallari M', 'Martinelli S', 'Formigaro L', 'Lista E', 'Bardi MA', 'Volta E', 'Tammiso E', 'Melandri A', 'Urso A', 'Cavazzini F', 'Negrini M', 'Cuneo A']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Arcispedale S.

We further investigated the role of miR-378 in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM-1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line established in the leukemic phase during the progression of MDS to AML (MDS/AML). Results indicated that overexpression of miR-378 in SKM-1 cells interfered with proliferation via inducing apoptosis and G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest, and suppressive effect of miR-378 on MDS/AML cells may be mediated partly through Bcl-w and CDC40. Moreover, apoptosis induced by miR-378 correlated with increased expression of Bax and activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Taken together, our data support a critical role for miR-378 in the pathogenesis of MDS and provide a novel therapeutic target in this complex disease.","['Kuang, Xingyi', 'Wei, Chunmei', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Yang, Zesong', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Kuang X', 'Wei C', 'Zhang T', 'Yang Z', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Endothelial dysfunction may lead to the pro-atherogenic effects associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Endothelial dysfunction induced by Hcy has been previously investigated; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated whether death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is involved in Hcyinduced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It was determined that Hcy treatment upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of DAPK in HUVECs. Additionally, it was identified that the knockdown of DAPK using small interfering RNA may attenuate the Hcy-induced apoptosis and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. DAPK inhibition may also reverse the effect of Hcy by the upregulation of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and poly ADPribose polymerase, and the downregulation of Bcl2associated X protein (Bax) and of caspase 3. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that DAPK contributed to the Hcyinduced endothelial apoptosis via modulation of Bcl2/Bax expression levels and activation of caspase 3.","['Tian, Xin', 'Shi, Yongfeng', 'Liu, Ning', 'Yan, Youyou', 'Li, Tianyi', 'Hua, Peiyan', 'Liu, Bin']","['Tian X', 'Shi Y', 'Liu N', 'Yan Y', 'Li T', 'Hua P', 'Liu B']","['Department of Cardiology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130041, P.R.

These fusion transcripts are pivotal in the pathogenesis of AL. Clinical laboratories universally employ conventional karyotype/FISH to detect these chromosomal translocations, which is complex, labour intensive and lacks multiplexing capacity. Hence, it is imperative to explore and evaluate some newer automated, cost-efficient multiplexed technologies to accommodate the expanding genetic landscape in AL. METHODS: ""nCounter(R) Leukemia fusion gene expression assay"" by NanoString was employed to detect various fusion transcripts in a large set samples (n = 94) utilizing RNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) diagnostic bone marrow biopsy specimens. This series included AL patients with various recurrent translocations (n = 49), normal karyotype (n = 19), or complex karyotype (n = 21), as well as normal bone marrow samples (n = 5). Fusion gene expression data were compared with results obtained by conventional karyotype and FISH technology to determine sensitivity/specificity, as well as positive /negative predictive values. RESULTS: Junction probes for PML/RARA; RUNX1-RUNX1T1; BCR/ABL1 showed 100 % sensitivity/specificity. A high degree of correlation was noted for MLL/AF4 (85 sensitivity/100 specificity) and TCF3-PBX1 (75 % sensitivity/100 % specificity) probes. CBFB-MYH11 fusion probes showed moderate sensitivity (57 %) but high specificity (100 %). ETV6/RUNX1 displayed discordance between fusion transcript assay and FISH results as well as rare non-specific binding in AL samples with normal or complex cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents preliminary data with high correlation between fusion transcript detection by a throughput automated multiplexed platform, compared to conventional karyotype/FISH technique for detection of chromosomal translocations in AL patients. Our preliminary observations, mandates further vast validation studies to explore automated molecular platforms in diagnostic pathology.","['Akhter, Ariz', 'Mughal, Muhammad Kashif', 'Elyamany, Ghaleb', 'Sinclair, Gary', 'Azma, Raja Zahratul', 'Masir, Noraidah', 'Shuib, Salwati', 'Rashid-Kolvear, Fariborz', 'Shabani-Rad, Meer-Taher', 'Stewart, Douglas Allan', 'Mansoor, Adnan']","['Akhter A', 'Mughal MK', 'Elyamany G', 'Sinclair G', 'Azma RZ', 'Masir N', 'Shuib S', 'Rashid-Kolvear F', 'Shabani-Rad MT', 'Stewart DA', 'Mansoor A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Cheras, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Cheras, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Cheras, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Departments of Oncology and Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.

We investigated time trends and factors associated with childhood cancer survival on a national level in Switzerland, from 1976 to 2013. We extracted data from the population-based Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry of 5,776 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer from 1985 to 2014 in Switzerland. We calculated age-adjusted 5-year survival, defined the annual reduction in risk of death (ARR), and explored associations of survival with clinical and demographic factors. Overall, 5-year survival improved significantly, from 64% in 1976-1983 to 88% in 2004-2013. ARR over the whole period was 4% for all diagnostic groups, greatest for Hodgkin lymphomas (8%), ependymomas (6%), Burkitt's lymphomas (6%) and germ cell tumours (6%). Children treated in hospitals without specialised paediatric cancer centre for leukaemia (HR 12.9), lymphoma (HR 5.0) and neuroblastoma (HR 3.7) were at higher risk of death. In French-speaking Switzerland, risk of death was lower for lymphoma (HR 0.6), CNS tumours (HR 0.7) and neuroblastoma (HR 0.5). Children with migration background had a higher risk of death from all tumours except bone tumours. Childhood cancer survival significantly improved from 1976 to 2013, but there is room for further improvement. Survival rates varied by type of clinical treatment, language region and nationality. All paediatric cancer patients should be referred to a specialised paediatric cancer centre. Further research is needed to intervene and completely eliminate inequalities in survival.","['Schindler, Matthias', 'Belle, Fabien N', 'Grotzer, Michael A', 'von der Weid, Nicolas X', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Schindler M', 'Belle FN', 'Grotzer MA', 'von der Weid NX', 'Kuehni CE']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Finkenhubelweg 11, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Finkenhubelweg 11, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.', ""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital of Zurich, Steinwiesstrasse 75, CH-8032 Zuerich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital Basel UKKB, Spitalstrasse 33, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Finkenhubelweg 11, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161003,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate/*trends', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30434 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Jan 1;140(1):62-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30434.

We sought to characterize the timing, severity, and intensive care management of cytokine release syndrome after chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic children's hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine subjects with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell therapy on a phase I/IIa clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01626495). INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell therapy. Thirteen subjects with cardiovascular dysfunction were treated with the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen subjects (46%) developed grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome, with prolonged fever (median, 6.5 d), hyperferritinemia (median peak ferritin, 60,214 ng/mL), and organ dysfunction. Fourteen (36%) developed cardiovascular dysfunction treated with vasoactive infusions a median of 5 days after T cell therapy. Six (15%) developed acute respiratory failure treated with invasive mechanical ventilation a median of 6 days after T cell therapy; five met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Encephalopathy, hepatic, and renal dysfunction manifested later than cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction. Subjects had a median of 15 organ dysfunction days (interquartile range, 8-20). Treatment with tocilizumab in 13 subjects resulted in rapid defervescence (median, 4 hr) and clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 46% of patients following T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clinicians should be aware of expanding use of this breakthrough therapy and implications for critical care units in cancer centers.","['Fitzgerald, Julie C', 'Weiss, Scott L', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Barrett, David M', 'Lacey, Simon F', 'Melenhorst, J Joseph', 'Shaw, Pamela', 'Berg, Robert A', 'June, Carl H', 'Porter, David L', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Teachey, David T']","['Fitzgerald JC', 'Weiss SL', 'Maude SL', 'Barrett DM', 'Lacey SF', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Shaw P', 'Berg RA', 'June CH', 'Porter DL', 'Frey NV', 'Grupp SA', 'Teachey DT']","[""1Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. 2Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. 3Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. 4Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. 5Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Abramson Cancer Center, The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Young Adult']",PMC5452983,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CCM.0000000000002053 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2017 Feb;45(2):e124-e131. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000002053.,"['K23 GM110496/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193776/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'I031V2H011 (tocilizumab)']",['NIHMS858865'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01626495'],,,,,,,

In human tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells, telomere length (TL) is maintained by the telomerase complex, which consists of a reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) and an RNA template (TERC). Very short telomeres and loss-of-function mutations in the TERT and TERC genes have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia, but the role of telomeres in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been well established. We report the results for a large cohort of 187 PML/RARalpha-positive APL patients. No germline mutations in the TERT or TERC genes were identified. Codon 279 and 1062 TERT polymorphisms were present at a frequency similar to that in the general population. TL measured in blood or marrow mononuclear cells at diagnosis was significantly shorter in the APL patients than in healthy volunteers, and shorter telomeres at diagnosis were significantly associated with high-risk disease. For patients who achieved complete remission, the median increase in TL from diagnosis to remission (delta TL) was 2.0 kilobase (kb), and we found delta TL to be the most powerful predictor of overall survival when compared with well-established risk factors for poor outcomes in APL.","['Baljevic, Muhamed', 'Dumitriu, Bogdan', 'Lee, Ju-Whei', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Chen, Christina', 'Stein, Eytan M', 'Gallagher, Robert E', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Young, Neal S', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Baljevic M', 'Dumitriu B', 'Lee JW', 'Paietta EM', 'Wiernik PH', 'Racevskis J', 'Chen C', 'Stein EM', 'Gallagher RE', 'Rowe JM', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Powell BL', 'Larson RA', 'Coutre SE', 'Lancet J', 'Litzow MR', 'Luger SM', 'Young NS', 'Tallman MS']","['Oncology/Hematology Division, The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebr., USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160916,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Codon', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'RNA/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere Homeostasis/drug effects/*genetics']",PMC5198772,['of Conflicts of Interest: Authors report no conflicts of interest.'],2016/09/16 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['000448160 [pii]', '10.1159/000448160 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(4):210-218. doi: 10.1159/000448160.

Our institution has switched relapse treatment strategy to improve survival. We reviewed records of first relapse/refractory childhood ALL between 1996 and 2012. Based on length of first remission, relapse site and immunophenotype, patients were classified into two groups: standard-risk relapse (SRR) and high-risk relapse and refractory (HRRR). Before 2007, all patients were uniformly treated with the same induction as at presentation, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Since 2007, treatment was given according to risk of failure: SRR were mostly treated with chemotherapy; HRRR patients underwent HSCT after intensive chemotherapy, aiming reduction of pre-transplant disease burden. Sixty-four patients were included. Thirty (47%) were SRR and 34 (53%) HRRR, including 11 with refractory ALL. Five-years overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were similar for SRR, but were significantly higher with new risk-based strategy for HRRR: 56% versus 17% (P = 0.03) for OS, and 56% vs 11% for EFS (P = 0.008), respectively. In multivariate analysis, treatment strategy was significantly associated with survival.

While basal cell carcinoma is the most common tumor, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) causes higher morbidity and has a risk of metastatic spread, depending on immune status, tumor size, and desmoplastic growth. We reported the case of a 77 year old male patient with retroauricular tumor, which started growing 3 years ago and was excised, buth relapsed three times. The initial diagnosis was infundibular cyst. Delayed Mohs surgery was performed, as was an additional open lymph node biopsy of the patient's right groin, on the occasion of an indolent swelling of the same which developed within 3 months. The first histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of a cystic squamous cell carcinoma. The histopathologic evaluation of the groin tumor revealed a small lymphocytic B cell lymphoma (BCL). The patient fulfilled the following criteria for high-risk SCC: tumor size >/=2 cm (or 1 cm on the head and 6 mm on the genitals, hands, and feet), tumor thickness >/=4 mm, recurrent tumor, rapid growth. Therefore, lymph node metastasis had to be considered. High-risk SCC has a propensity to metastasize. In cases of primary tumor, Mohs surgery is the most effective treatment, particularly in relapsing tumors. The combination of cystic SCC with a small-sized BCL is very rare. The differential diagnosis and treatment may be challenging. In high-risk SCC, lymph node enlargement warrants histologic evaluation.

The most common development site was the lymph node. Testicular lesions were statistically more frequent in MS as a recurrence of AML than in other types of MS (P=0.0183). MS tended to lack myeloid markers (myeloperoxidase was present in 63.2%, CD68 in 51.3%, CD13 in 48.7%, and CD33 in 48.7% of patients) and express T-cell markers such as CD3 (20.7%) and CD5 (34.2%). All T-cell marker-positive MS cases were negative for the alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell receptors on immunohistochemistry. Underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm was a poor prognostic factor (vs. de novo MS: P=0.0383; vs. MS with concomitant AML: P=0.0143). However, there was no statistical difference in prognosis between de novo MS and MS with concomitant AML (P=0.288). There were no significant differences in prognosis between the prognoses of T-cell marker-positive and T-cell marker-negative MS cases. In addition, CXCR4 expression was a poor prognostic factor in MS (P=0.0229).

Cancer risk was estimated by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) in the early (4-27 months after HIV registration), late (28-60 months), and overall (4-60 months) incidence periods. Cancers diagnosed prior to or within 3 months of HIV registration were considered prevalent.Of 613 linked cancers to PLHIV, 188 were prevalent, 106 early incident, and 319 late incident. Incident cancers comprised 11.5% AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs), including cervical cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but not Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and 88.5% non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). Risk for any incident cancer diagnosis in early, late, and combined periods was significantly elevated among PLHIV (SIRs: 5.6 [95% CI 4.6-6.8], 17.7 [95% CI 15.8-19.8], and 11.5 [95% CI 10-12.6], respectively). Cervical cancer risk was elevated in both incidence periods (SIRs: 9.6 [95% CI 4.8-17.2] and 22.6 [95% CI 14.3-33.9], respectively), while NHL risk was elevated only in the late incidence period (SIR: 18.0 [95% CI 9.8-30.20]). Risks for NADCs were dramatically elevated (SIR > 100) for eye-orbit, substantially (SIR > 20) for all-mouth, esophagus, breast, unspecified-leukemia, colon-rectum-anus, and other/unspecified cancers; moderately elevated (SIR > 10) for salivary gland, penis, nasopharynx, and brain-nervous system, and mildly elevated (SIR > 5) for stomach. Risks for 6 NADCs (small intestine, testis, lymphocytic leukemia, prostate, ovary, and melanoma) were not elevated and 5 cancers, including multiple myeloma not seen.Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using probabilistic record-linkage to study cancer/other comorbidities among PLHIV in India and provides preliminary population-based estimates of cancer risks in PLHIV in India. Our results, suggesting a potentially substantial burden and slightly different spectrum of cancers among PLHIV in India, support efforts to conduct multicenter linkage studies to obtain precise estimates and to monitor cancer risk in PLHIV in India.","['Godbole, Sheela V', 'Nandy, Karabi', 'Gauniyal, Mansi', 'Nalawade, Pallavi', 'Sane, Suvarna', 'Koyande, Shravani', 'Toyama, Joy', 'Hegde, Asha', 'Virgo, Phil', 'Bhatia, Kishor', 'Paranjape, Ramesh S', 'Risbud, Arun R', 'Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Mitsuyasu, Ronald T']","['Godbole SV', 'Nandy K', 'Gauniyal M', 'Nalawade P', 'Sane S', 'Koyande S', 'Toyama J', 'Hegde A', 'Virgo P', 'Bhatia K', 'Paranjape RS', 'Risbud AR', 'Mbulaiteye SM', 'Mitsuyasu RT']","['National AIDS Research Institute (ICMR), Pune, India School of Nursing and Department Of Biostatistics University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA Mumbai (Bombay) Cancer Registry, Indian Cancer Society, Mumbai, India Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, Mumbai, India Computer Services Corporation, Rockville Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland University of California, Centre for AIDS Research and Education, David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/virology', '*Registries', 'Young Adult']",PMC5402588,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000004850 [doi]', '00005792-201609130-00047 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Sep;95(37):e4850. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004850.,['P30 AI028697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the safety and feasibility of switching to Erwinia asparaginase after pegaspargase intolerance in adult ALL patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Our analysis included 10 patients, with a median age of 39 years (range 20-72), male predominance (90%), and a typical B-cell to T-cell ratio (70:30%) for ALL. Nine patients were switched to Erwinia asparaginase after pegaspargase hypersensitivity and one patient after grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia secondary to pegaspargase. With Erwinia asparaginase, no hypersensitivity reactions occurred and no patient developed other known clinical asparaginase-related toxicities. Laboratory adverse effects consisted of mostly mild elevation in liver enzymes. No morphologic relapses have occurred in any patient switched to Erwinia asparaginase in first remission at a follow up of 0.4-34.6 months. These findings are unique in that all of our patients received Erwinia asparaginase after hypersensitivity or intolerance to pegaspargase and 50% of them were older than 40 years of age, a population with very limited Erwinia asparaginase data. Our observations provide preliminary information that treatment with Erwinia asparaginase can proceed as scheduled in adult patients, despite pegaspargase hypersensitivity and possibly liver intolerance.","['Horvat, Troy Z', 'Pecoraro, Joshua J', 'Daley, Ryan J', 'Buie, Larry W', 'King, Amber C', 'Rampal, Raajit K', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Park, Jae H', 'Douer, Dan']","['Horvat TZ', 'Pecoraro JJ', 'Daley RJ', 'Buie LW', 'King AC', 'Rampal RK', 'Tallman MS', 'Park JH', 'Douer D']","['Department of Pharmacy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

In order to evaluate the usefulness of initial coagulation parameters in the predictive value of APL diagnosis, 1304 consecutive newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, including APL (n=211), non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (n=781) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=312) were retrospectively evaluated between January 2011 and May 2015. The area under curve (AUC) of fibrinogen was the largest among the coagulation markers based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The optimum cutoff value of fibrinogen was 1.87g/L (AUC=0.912, sensitivity 80.1% and specificity 88.8%). The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer was 2191mug/L (AUC=0.786, sensitivity 81.1% and specificity 67.8%). The AUC difference between the fibrinogen and D-dimer was significant (P<0.001). Other coagulation markers showed less predictive power. Importantly, in the analysis of high white blood cell count (over 10x10(9)/L) subgroup, a low fibrinogen level could efficiently discriminate APL patients from controls (AUC=0.983, sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 94.4%) with a criterion value </=1.71g/L.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot work was to describe the multidimensional symptoms and health-related quality of life experienced by patients with a new diagnosis of AML across induction chemotherapy. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal descriptive study design was implemented to evaluate symptoms and health-related quality of life at the time of enrollment through 6 weeks postdiagnosis and identify who might be most at risk of experiencing high symptom burden. RESULTS: A total of 19 participants were included in this analysis. Moderate to severe levels of distress were present in 25% to 50% of participants, depending on timing in treatment. Females and those with a previous history of a psychological disorder reported higher symptom burden during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that adults with AML experience multiple distressing symptoms during the induction treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Timely routine multidimensional assessment of symptoms in individuals undergoing induction chemotherapy treatment for AML is critical as they may be experiencing multiple concurrent symptoms. Additional research to advance symptom assessment and amelioration of distressing symptoms to improve health-related quality of life is needed in this unique population.","['Albrecht, Tara A', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Elswick, R K Jr', 'Starkweather, Angela', 'Rosenzweig, Margaret']","['Albrecht TA', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Elswick RK Jr', 'Starkweather A', 'Rosenzweig M']","['Author Affiliations: School of Nursing (Drs Albrecht and Elswick), and Massey Cancer Center (Dr Albrecht), Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Dr Boyiadzis); School of Nursing, University of Connecticut, Storrs (Dr Starkweather); School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Dr Rosenzweig).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/complications/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychometrics/instrumentation/methods', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Report', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Syndrome']",PMC5350068,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000428 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2017 Nov/Dec;40(6):E31-E38. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000428.,['T32 NR011972/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS800546'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although less common than other myeloproliferative neoplasms, derangement of various components of the haemostatic system is observed in CML. Haemostatic abnormalities have been described in relation to hyperleucostasis and drugs used to treat CML. However, the correlation between haemostatic derangements and phase of CML is unclear in the literature. AIM: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assay various haemostatic parameters in patients of CML receiving Imatinib and to determine any correlation between them and phases of disease as well as the status of remission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 30 patients with CML (17 males, 13 females, mean age of 35.53 +/- 8.92 years) receiving imatinib mesylate. Haemostatic parameters including platelet counts, Prothrombin Time (PT), activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), fibrinogen, D-dimers and Factor VIII levels were assayed for all patients using standard methods. Bcr-abl gene product (quantitative) was determined on the peripheral blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patients were grouped into phases of disease (chronic, accelerated and blast) and their response to imatinib was determined in the form of remission (clinical, haematological and molecular). Correlations were drawn between them using spearman's coefficient. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between PT (p=0.002), fibrinogen (p=0.011), D-dimers (p=0.050), Factor VIII levels (p=0.006) with the phase of CML and a significant negative correlation was observed between PT (p=0.003, 0.006), fibrinogen (p=0.010, 0.005), D-dimers (p=0.035, 0.017), Factor VIII levels (p=0.005, 0.001) and clinical and haematological remission respectively. No significant correlation of platelet counts and APTT was seen with the phase of CML or remission status. CONCLUSION: Haemostatic system is significantly disturbed in CML and correlate positively with the progression of the disease. Imatinib treatment leads to improvement in some of these parameters.","['Jain, Ankur', 'Gupta, Naresh', 'Singh, Tejinder', 'Agarwal, Sunita']","['Jain A', 'Gupta N', 'Singh T', 'Agarwal S']","['Postgraduate Student, Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College , Delhi, India .', 'Professor and Head, Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College , Delhi, India .', 'Professor, Department of Pathology, Maulana Azad Medical College , Delhi, India .', 'Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College , Delhi, India .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160701,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,PMC5020258,,2016/09/16 06:00,2016/09/16 06:01,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2016/19185.8135 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2016 Jul;10(7):OC19-23. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2016/19185.8135.

Thrombocytopaenia is a common complication of dengue and other viral fevers apart from malaria, typhoid, leptospirosis, leukaemia and megaloblastic anaemia. A platelet count of <20,000/mul is characteristically seen in dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue fever. It results from immune complex mediated platelet destruction or bone marrow suppression. Severe thrombocytopaenia <10,000/mul is one of the indications for prophylactic platelet transfusion therapy to prevent haemorrhage. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of transfusion of ABO compatible and ABO incompatible pooled platelet units in severe thrombocytopaenia cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study ABO compatible and incompatible pooled platelet units were transfused to serologically confirmed dengue cases having thrombocytopaenia with or without bleeding manifestations. Each of the adult patients received 4-6 units of pooled platelet concentrates prepared from random donor whole blood suspended in plasma for severe thrombocytopaenia. Pre and post transfusion platelet counts were compared. Children aged less than 12 years, pregnant women and patients with splenomegaly those on ayurvedic and homeopathic therapy, recipients of packed red cells on the same day of platelet transfusion and recipients of multiple platelet transfusions within 24 hours were excluded from the study. RESULTS: The median post transfusion platelet increments (PPI) and corrected count increments (CCI) at 4hour post transfusion were 25,000/muL (5,000-80,000/muL) and 18,000/muL (range 8,000/muL- 47,500/muL) respectively among the responders. Median PPI and CCI at 24 hours were 45,000/muL and 28,863/muL among the responders. The median CCI at 4 hour post transfusion among the non-responders was 850/muL and at 24hours was 1,425/muL. At 24 hours responders showed significantly higher PPI as compared to non responders. The average platelets transfused were 4units in case of responders and 8 units in case of non-responders. CONCLUSION: ABO identical and compatible pooled platelet transfusions were more successful in increasing the post transfusion platelet counts as compared to ABO incompatible pooled platelets.","['Bhat, Amoolya', 'Chowdappa, Vijaya', 'Masamatti, Smita Surendra']","['Bhat A', 'Chowdappa V', 'Masamatti SS']","['Assistant Professor, Department of Pathology, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre , Bengaluru, Karnataka, india .', 'Professor and Head, Department of Pathology, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre , Bengaluru, Karnataka, india .', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Pathology, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre , Bengaluru, Karnataka, india .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160701,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,PMC5020224,,2016/09/16 06:00,2016/09/16 06:01,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2016/19278.8213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2016 Jul;10(7):EC21-4. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2016/19278.8213.

The hierarchical organization is helpful for effective and robust cytometry data mining, including the creation of collections of cell populations' characteristic of different classes of samples, robust classification, and anomaly detection. We summarize a set of samples belonging to a biological class or category with a statistically derived template for the class. Whereas individual samples are represented in terms of their cell populations (clusters), a template consists of generic meta-populations (a group of homogeneous cell populations obtained from the samples in a class) that describe key phenotypes shared among all those samples. We organize an FC data collection in a hierarchical data structure that supports the identification of immunophenotypes relevant to clinical diagnosis. A robust template-based classification scheme is also developed, but our primary focus is in the discovery of phenotypic signatures and inter-sample relationships in an FC data collection. This collective analysis approach is more efficient and robust since templates describe phenotypic signatures common to cell populations in several samples while ignoring noise and small sample-specific variations. We have applied the template-based scheme to analyze several datasets, including one representing a healthy immune system and one of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. The last task is challenging due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of the several subtypes of AML. However, we identified thirteen immunophenotypes corresponding to subtypes of AML and were able to distinguish acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) samples with the markers provided. Clinically, this is helpful since APL has a different treatment regimen from other subtypes of AML.

T lymphocytes represent a key component of the non-neuronal cholinergic system. T cells-derived ACh is involved in a stimulation of their activation and proliferation, and acts as a regulator of immune response. The aim of the present work was to summarize the data about components of cholinergic machinery in T lymphocytes, with an emphasis on the comparison of healthy and leukemic T cells. Cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemias of T lineage (T-ALL) were found to produce a considerably higher amount of ACh than healthy T lymphocytes. Additionally, ACh produced by T-ALL is not efficiently hydrolyzed, because acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is drastically decreased in these cells. Up-regulation of muscarinic ACh receptors was also demonstrated at expression and functional level, whereas nicotinic ACh receptors seem to play a less important role and not form functional channels in cells derived from T-ALL. We hypothesized that ACh over-produced in T-ALL may act as an autocrine growth factor and play an important role in leukemic clonal expansion through shaping of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. We suggest that cholinergic machinery may be attractive targets for new drugs against T-ALL. Specifically, testing of high affinity antagonists of muscarinic ACh receptors as well as antagomiRs, which interfere with miRNAs involved in the suppression of AChE expression, may be the first choice options.","['Dobrovinskaya, Oxana', 'Valencia-Cruz, Georgina', 'Castro-Sanchez, Luis', 'Bonales-Alatorre, Edgar O', 'Linan-Rico, Liliana', 'Pottosin, Igor']","['Dobrovinskaya O', 'Valencia-Cruz G', 'Castro-Sanchez L', 'Bonales-Alatorre EO', 'Linan-Rico L', 'Pottosin I']","['Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de ColimaColima, Mexico; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaMexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima Colima, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160831,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,PMC5005329,,2016/09/16 06:00,2016/09/16 06:01,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2016.00290 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2016 Aug 31;7:290. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2016.00290. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T leukemia', 'T lymphocyte', 'acetylcholine', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'calcium signaling', 'choline acetyltransferase', 'muscarinic receptor non-neuronal cholinergic system']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical and cytological presentations of LUCX vary and establishing diagnosis is often difficult. Surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 73-year-old woman with recurrent pathological PAP smears of the cervix and a history of chronic lymphatic leukemia 15 years ago. Colposcopy of the cervix showed no acetowhite lesion and a conization was performed. Histology revealed endocervical lymphoid cells, specified as low-malignant B-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the cervix based on the expression of CD5, CD20, and CD23, whilst CD10 and cyclin D1 were negative. The diagnosis was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Staging revealed enlarged iliacal, para-aortic, mediastinal, cervical, subclavicular, and inguinal lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow analysis confirmed lymphoid infiltration consistent with B-cell lymphoma. The patient was scheduled for a combined immuno-chemotherapy with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. In a MEDLINE literature search, 246 cases of LUCX were identified. One hundred and eighty-five cases were primary and 61 cases were secondary manifestations of LUCX. With a mean follow-up time of 38 months, overall survival was 81%. Data in the literature including clinical and histological characteristics of LUCX as well as the clinical management and prognosis are discussed herein. CONCLUSION: LUCX is rare and has distinct clinical and histological features. LUCX is usually treated with local surgical excision followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.","['Hilal, Ziad', 'Hartmann, Franziska', 'Dogan, Askin', 'Cetin, Cem', 'Krentel, Harald', 'Schiermeier, Sven', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Tempfer, Clemens B']","['Hilal Z', 'Hartmann F', 'Dogan A', 'Cetin C', 'Krentel H', 'Schiermeier S', 'Schultheis B', 'Tempfer CB']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Anna Hospital, Herne, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Marienhospital Witten, Witten, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany clemens.tempfer@rub.de.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Aged', 'Cervix Uteri/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology/surgery', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['36/9/4931 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11059 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4931-40. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11059.,,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,,"['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'CLL', 'Lymphoma', 'cervix', 'immunohistochemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well-known risk factors are age, cytogenetics, and treatment intensity. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of insurance status on the outcome of AML; age, Carlson comorbidity index, distance travelled to the treatment center, and type of treatment center were adjusted by analyzing data from National Cancer Database (NCDB). In the wake of the Affordable Care Act, and its impact on insurance coverage, evaluating the effect having insurance has on health outcome is urgently necessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from 67,443 men and women (>/=18 years of age), who were registered in the NCDB and diagnosed with AML between 1998 and 2011 with follow-up to the end of 2012. The primary predictor variable was payer status, and the outcome variable was overall survival. Additional variables addressed and adjusted, included: sex, age, race, Charleston Comorbidity index, level of education, income, distance traveled, facility type, diagnosing/treating facility, treatment delay, and chemotherapy. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for other predictor variables, payer status was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival for AML. Relative to privately insured patients, patients with Medicaid had a 17% increased risk, those without insurance had a 21% increased risk, those with Medicare had a 19% increased risk and those with unknown insurance status had a 22% increased risk of mortality from AML. The percentage of patients surviving from AML after 24 months was 37.6%, 31.4%, 32.3%, 31.8%, and 33.1% for patients with private, unknown, Medicare, uninsured, and Medicaid payer status, respectively. All factors investigated were found to be significant predictors of AML survival except distance traveled. CONCLUSION: We observed that payer status has a statistically significant relationship with overall survival from AML.","['Master, Samip', 'Munker, Reinhold', 'Shi, Zhenzhen', 'Mills, Glenn', 'Shi, Runhua']","['Master S', 'Munker R', 'Shi Z', 'Mills G', 'Shi R']","['Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Medicine & Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A. rshi@lsuhsc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Insurance Coverage', '*Insurance, Health', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Medicaid', 'Middle Aged', 'United States']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['36/9/4915 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11057 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4915-21. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11057.,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'insurance', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with ALL who underwent TBI-based conditioning regimen at our Institution between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: A total of 211 patients were included. The median follow-up was 40 months. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 64.7% and 62.8%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate for the 163 children was 67.6% (95% confidence interval=55-77%). Disease status at time of transplant did not improve disease-free survival. Gastrointestinal acute toxicity was the most common early side-effect (19.9%). Acute graft-versus-host disease was reported in 31 patients (14.7%). Main late toxicities were cataract induction (12.8%) and growth, gonadal and endocrine effects (36%).

In an effort to further enlighten the molecular pathology of brain oncogenesis involving the her-2 (erbB-2/neu/ngl)/N-ras/nf1 pathway, we screened the genotypes of specimens from various types of brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The studied specimens included 35 biopsies of four general categories: 13 neuroglial tumors (4 astrocytomas, 2 oligodendrogliomas, 7 glioblastomas multiforme), 14 meningiomas, 3 other nervous system tumors (2 schwannomas, 1 craniopharyngioma) and 5 metastatic tumors (such as lung carcinomas and chronic myelocytic leukemia). Screening for most common mutations in oncogenes her-2, N-ras and tumor suppressor gene nf1 was conducted with molecular hybridization techniques (Southern blotting, dot blot and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, respectively), and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Gene amplification of her-2 was observed in only two cases (6%), namely in one glioblastoma and in one meningioma. Screening of 3 hot spot codons of the N-ras gene (12, 13 and 61) and subsequent DNA sequencing revealed mutations in 19 biopsies encompassing all categories (54%). Screening for mutations in exons of the nf1 gene by SSCP analysis detected a novel nonsense mutation in exon 31 in a unique case of a glioblastoma biopsy (3%) taken from a patient without neurofibromatosis type I. CONCLUSION: Activated N-ras appears to be a major oncogene in brain oncogenesis, exhibiting the most important role in the her-2/N-ras/nf1 pathway.","['Yapijakis, Christos', 'Adamopoulou, Maria', 'Tasiouka, Konstantina', 'Voumvourakis, Costas', 'Stranjalis, George']","['Yapijakis C', 'Adamopoulou M', 'Tasiouka K', 'Voumvourakis C', 'Stranjalis G']","['1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece cyapi@med.uoa.gr.', '1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Attikon Hospital, Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Neurosurgery, University of Athens Medical School, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism', 'Codon', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neurofibromin 1/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['36/9/4607 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11010 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Sep;36(9):4607-11. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11010.,,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,"['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mutation screening', 'N-ras', 'brain tumors', 'her-2', 'nf1', 'oncogenes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo methylation of a CpG island region located upstream of PTCH exon 1 was confirmed by pyrosequencing in 17/37 (46%) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CLL, but in none isolated from seven healthy individuals. No association was found between PTCH hypermethylation and currently used prognostic CLL factors.

In this study, we demonstrate that BCR associated with the alpha subunit of casein kinase II (CK2alpha), rather than BCR itself, is required for inflammation development. We found that BCR knockdown inhibited NF-kappaB activation in vitro and in vivo. Computer simulation, however, suggested that the putative BCR kinase domain has an unstable structure with minimal enzymatic activity. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that CK2alpha associated with BCR. We found the BCR functions are mediated by CK2alpha. Indeed, CK2alpha associated with adaptor molecules of TNF-alphaR and phosphorylated BCR at Y177 to establish a p65 binding site after TNF-alpha stimulation. Notably, p65 S529 phosphorylation by CK2alpha creates a p300 binding site and increased p65-mediated transcription followed by inflammation development in vivo. These results suggest that BCR-mediated inflammation is dependent on CK2alpha, and the BCR-CK2alpha complex could be a novel therapeutic target for various inflammatory diseases.","['Meng, Jie', 'Jiang, Jing-Jing', 'Atsumi, Toru', 'Bando, Hidenori', 'Okuyama, Yuko', 'Sabharwal, Lavannya', 'Nakagawa, Ikuma', 'Higuchi, Haruka', 'Ota, Mitsutoshi', 'Okawara, Momoko', 'Ishitani, Ryuichiro', 'Nureki, Osamu', 'Higo, Daisuke', 'Arima, Yasunobu', 'Ogura, Hideki', 'Kamimura, Daisuke', 'Murakami, Masaaki']","['Meng J', 'Jiang JJ', 'Atsumi T', 'Bando H', 'Okuyama Y', 'Sabharwal L', 'Nakagawa I', 'Higuchi H', 'Ota M', 'Okawara M', 'Ishitani R', 'Nureki O', 'Higo D', 'Arima Y', 'Ogura H', 'Kamimura D', 'Murakami M']","['Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Immunology, Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Medicine, and World Premier International Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan; and.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan; and.', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama 221-0022, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Neuroimmunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 080-0615, Japan; murakami@igm.hokudai.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160914,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis/*genetics', 'Arthritis, Experimental/genetics', 'Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601082 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601082 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Oct 15;197(8):3111-3119. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601082.

Its functions are regulated tightly by posttranslational modifications. Here we show that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a novel modulator of p53. We found that BTK is induced in response to DNA damage and p53 activation. BTK induction leads to p53 phosphorylation, which constitutes a positive feedback loop that increases p53 protein levels and enhances the transactivation of its target genes in response to stress. Inhibiting BTK reduced both p53-dependent senescence and apoptosis. Further, BTK expression also upregulated DNA damage signals and apoptosis. We conclude that despite being involved in oncogenic signals in blood malignancies, BTK has antineoplastic properties in other contexts, such as the enhancement of p53's tumor suppressor responses. Along with evidence that BTK expression correlates with good prognosis in some epithelial tumors, our findings may encourage a reevaluation of the clinical uses of BTK inhibitors in cancer therapy.

Disease eradication, however, is hampered by innate resistance of leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) to TKI-induced killing, which also provides the basis for subsequent emergence of TKI-resistant mutants. We report that EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed in CML LICs and required for colony formation and survival and cell-cycle progression of CML cell lines. A critical role for EZH2 is supported by genetic studies in a mouse CML model. Inactivation of Ezh2 in conventional conditional mice and through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing prevents initiation and maintenance of disease and survival of LICs, irrespective of BCR-ABL1 mutational status, and extends survival. Expression of the EZH2 homolog EZH1 is reduced in EZH2-deficient CML LICs, creating a scenario resembling complete loss of PRC2. EZH2 dependence of CML LICs raises prospects for improved therapy of TKI-resistant CML and/or eradication of disease by addition of EZH2 inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: This work defines EZH2 as a selective vulnerability for CML cells and their LICs, regardless of BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Our findings provide an experimental rationale for improving disease eradication through judicious use of EZH2 inhibitors within the context of standard-of-care TKI therapy.

These are BCR-ABL1 kinase independent, refractory to apoptosis, and serve as a reservoir to drive relapse or TKI resistance. We demonstrate that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 is misregulated in chronic phase CML LSCs. This is associated with extensive reprogramming of H3K27me3 targets in LSCs, thus sensitizing them to apoptosis upon treatment with an EZH2-specific inhibitor (EZH2i). EZH2i does not impair normal hematopoietic stem cell survival. Strikingly, treatment of primary CML cells with either EZH2i or TKI alone caused significant upregulation of H3K27me3 targets, and combined treatment further potentiated these effects and resulted in significant loss of LSCs compared to TKI alone, in vitro, and in long-term bone marrow murine xenografts. Our findings point to a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy to more effectively target LSCs in patients with CML receiving TKIs. SIGNIFICANCE: In CML, TKI-persistent LSCs remain an obstacle to cure, and approaches to eradicate them remain a significant unmet clinical need. We demonstrate that EZH2 and H3K27me3 reprogramming is important for LSC survival, but renders LSCs sensitive to the combined effects of EZH2i and TKI. This represents a novel approach to more effectively target LSCs in patients receiving TKI treatment. Cancer Discov; 6(11); 1248-57.

Anemia is the most frequent cytopenia diagnosed in patients with MDS. Regular RBC transfusions are the only treatment option for about 40% of patients. Transfusion-dependent patients develop secondary iron overload. The influence of serum ferritin (SF) concentration on survival and acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS patients remains controversial. The data for the Central European population is scarce and so far there is no description for Poland. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of the relationship of SF concentration with red blood cell transfusion dependency, survival and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data of the 819 MDS patients (58% male; median age 70 years) included in the MDS Registry of the MDS Section of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG). RESULTS: Analyses were performed on 190 patients diagnosed with MDS, maximal 6 months before inclusion to the registry in order to avoid selection bias (a shorter survival of higher risk MDS patients). Patients with hyperferritinemia higher than 1000 ng/L vs. patients with SF concentration lower than 1000 ng/L had a median survival of 320 days vs. 568 days, respectively (p log-rank = 0.014). The following factors were found to significantly worsen survival: RBC-transfusion dependence (p = 0.0033; HR 2.67L), platelet transfusion dependence (p = 0.0071; HR 3.321), hemoglobin concentration lower than 10 g/dL (p = 0.0036; HR 2.97), SF concentration higher than 1000 ng/L (p = 0.0023; HR = 2.94), platelet count lower than 10 G/L (p = 0.0081 HR = 5.04), acute leukemia transformation (p = 0.0081; HR 1.968). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the relatively low number of patients in previous studies exploring hyperferritinemia in MDS, the results of the first Polish MDS Registry provide important insights. Hyperferritinemia higher than 1000 ng/L can be an important indicator of poor prognosis in MDS.","['Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Madry, Krzysztof', 'Machowicz, Rafal', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Mital, Andrzej', 'Obara, Agata', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Sikorska, Anna', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw W', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga']","['Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Madry K', 'Machowicz R', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Mital A', 'Obara A', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Sikorska A', 'Subocz E', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Internal Diseases, Military Institute of Medicine, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*mortality/*therapy', 'Poland', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2015/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17219/acem/62397 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2016 Jul-Aug;25(4):633-41. doi: 10.17219/acem/62397.,,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hyperferritinemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'red blood cell transfusion dependence', 'serum ferritin concentration', 'transformation to acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and its mechanism of thalidomide and IFN on inhibiting the proliferation of Kasumi-1 cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thalidomide, IFN and a combination of both drugs were used to treat Kasumi-1 cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation and the apoptosis rate were measured. Vascular endothelial growth factor levels and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were detected by ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Thalidomide and IFN could both inhibit Kasumi-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. When Kasumi-1 cells were treated with thalidomide 350 mug/mL or IFN1400 U/mL for 48 h, the proliferation inhibition rates were (48.8 +/- 4.64)% and (50.19 +/- 2.59)% and the rates of apoptosis were (14.68 +/- 2.61)% and (21.71 +/- 0.71)%, respectively; when treated with a combination, the cell proliferation inhibition rate and apoptotic rate were statistically significantly higher than both the control group and the groups treated with a single drug. The ELISA assay revealed that both 350 mug/mL of thalidomide and 1400 U/mL of IFN could reduce the VEGF levels in cell culture supernatants; the two-drug combination group had a further decreased VEGF concentration. Forty-eighthour treatment of thalidomide 350 mug/mL and IFN 1400 U/mL could significantly decrease Bcl-2 expression and increase the expression levels of phosphor-P38, BAX, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3, -8, and -9 as compared to the control group. The combination group exhibited significantly greater extents of reduction in Bcl-2 protein and increases in p-P38, BAX, and cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3, -8, and -9 protein expression as compared to the single drug groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide and IFN can synergistically inhibit Kasumi-1 cell proliferation, which is possibly achieved through the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways and through the activation of the P38 signaling pathway to induce apoptosis and by inhibiting Kasumi-1 cell autocrine VEGF secretion.","['Xu, Hao', 'Mi, Ruihua', 'Fan, Ruihua', 'Yin, Qingsong', 'Wei, Xudong']","['Xu H', 'Mi R', 'Fan R', 'Yin Q', 'Wei X']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2016/12/24 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2014/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17219/acem/41048 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2016 May-Jun;25(3):403-8. doi: 10.17219/acem/41048.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Kasumi-1 cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'interferon', 'thalidomide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the impact of minimal residual disease (MRD)- and graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD)-guided multiple consolidation chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) to prevent second relapse in patients with acute leukemia relapsing post-transplant and who achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy and DLI. METHODS: Forty-seven subjects with acute leukemia relapsing after an allotransplant and who achieved complete remission after post-relapse induction chemotherapy and DLI were eligible. The use of consolidation chemotherapy and DLI was guided by the results of MRD testing and whether or not DLI caused acute and/or chronic GvHD. Outcomes were compared with those of 34 similar historical controls who did not receive consolidation chemotherapy and DLIs after induction chemotherapy and DLI. RESULTS: One-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 22 % 95 % confidence interval (10, 35 %) vs. 56 % (39, 73 %); P < 0.0001), leukemia-free survival (LFS; 71 % (57, 84 %) vs. 35 % (19, 51 %); P < 0.0001), and survival (78 % (66, 90 %) vs. 44 % (27, 61 %); P < 0.0001) was significantly better in subjects than controls. In multivariate analyses, no chronic GvHD after therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.56 (1.09, 11.58); P = 0.035) and a positive MRD test after therapy (HR = 21.04 (4.44, 94.87); P < 0.0001) were associated with an increased CIR. CONCLUSION: These data suggest MRD- and GvHD-guided multiple consolidation chemotherapy and DLIs reduce CIR and increase LFS and survival compared with controls in persons relapsing after allotransplant for acute leukemia.

Myeloid neoplasms with 3q21q26 aberrancies include acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and blast crisis of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Recent advances on myeloid neoplasms with inv(3)/t(3;3) with regard to clinicopathologic features and novel molecular or genomic findings warrant a comprehensive review on this topic. OBJECTIVE: - To review the clinicopathologic features and molecular as well as genomic alterations in myeloid neoplasms with inv(3)/t(3;3). DATA SOURCES: - The data came from published articles in English-language literature. CONCLUSIONS: - At the clinicopathologic front, recent studies on MDS with inv(3)/t(3;3) have highlighted their overlapping clinicopathologic features with and similar overall survival to that of inv(3)/t(3;3)-harboring AML regardless of the percentage of myeloid blasts. On the molecular front, AML and MDS with inv(3)/t(3;3) exhibit gene mutations, which affect the RAS/receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. Furthermore, functional genomic studies using genomic editing and genome engineering have shown that the reallocation of the GATA2 distal hematopoietic enhancer to the proximity of the promoter of ectopic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) without the formation of a new oncogenic fusion transcript is the molecular mechanism underlying these inv(3)/t(3;3) myeloid neoplasms. Although the AML and MDS with inv(3)/t(3;3) are listed as a separate category of myeloid malignancies in the 2008 World Health Organization classification, the overlapping clinicopathologic features, similar overall survival, and identical patterns at the molecular and genomic levels between AML and MDS patients with inv(3)/t(3;3) may collectively favor a unification of AML and MDS with inv(3)/t(3;3) as AML or myeloid neoplasms with inv(3)/t(3;3) regardless of the blast count.","['Wang, Huan-You', 'Rashidi, Hooman H']","['Wang HY', 'Rashidi HH']","['From the Department of Pathology, University of California San Diego Health System, La Jolla (Dr Wang); and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento (Dr Rashidi).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160915,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/trends', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Pathology, Clinical/methods/trends', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2016/09/16 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/09/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/arpa.2016-0059-RA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2016 Dec;140(12):1404-1410. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2016-0059-RA.

RESULTS: After chemotherapy, IADL dependence worsened (mean 1.4 baseline vs 2.1 follow-up, P < .001), as did mean SPPB scores (7.5 vs 5.9, P = .02 for total). Grip strength also declined (38.9 +/- 7.7 vs 34.2 +/- 10.3 kg, P < .001 for men; 24.5 +/- 4.8 vs 21.8 +/- 4.7 kg, P = .007 for women). No significant changes in cognitive function (mean 84.7 vs 85.1, P = .72) or depressive symptoms (14.0 vs. 11.3, P = .11) were detected, but symptoms of distress declined (5.0 vs 3.2, P < .001). Participants with depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up had greater declines in SPPB scores those without at both time points. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term survivors of intensive chemotherapy for AML had clinically meaningful declines in physical function. These data support the importance of interventions to maintain physical function during and after chemotherapy. Depressive symptoms before and during chemotherapy may be linked to potentially modifiable physical function declines.","['Klepin, Heidi D', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Ellis, Leslie R', 'Berenzon, Dmitriy', 'Mihalko, Shannon L', 'Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Rao, Arati V', 'Wildes, Tanya M', 'Williamson, Jeff D', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kritchevsky, Stephen B']","['Klepin HD', 'Tooze JA', 'Pardee TS', 'Ellis LR', 'Berenzon D', 'Mihalko SL', 'Danhauer SC', 'Rao AV', 'Wildes TM', 'Williamson JD', 'Powell BL', 'Kritchevsky SB']","['Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. hklepin@wakehealth.edu.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Wake Forest University Department of Health and Exercise Science, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section on Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Section on Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160914,United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/*psychology', 'Aged', 'Cognition/*physiology', '*Depression/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment/methods', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods/psychology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Mobility Limitation', 'Patient Discharge', 'Physical Examination/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survivors']",PMC5072995,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/07/06 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jgs.14301 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2016 Oct;64(10):1988-1995. doi: 10.1111/jgs.14301.

The antiproliferative potential (2.9-1500 microg/mL) was assessed by MTT assay after 72h using the human tumor lines SF-295 (glioblastoma), OVCAR-8 (ovarian), HCT-116 (colon) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and primary cultures of murine Sarcoma 180 (S180) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Allium cepa bulbs were exposed to growing respective doses (1 mL and 2 mL). Only Butter and Cheddar flavorings revealed cytotoxic activity on cancer cells, with IC50 values ranging from 125.4 microg/mL (Cheddar - HCT-116) to 402.6 microg/mL (Butter - OVCAR-8). Butter flavoring was the most cytotoxic on PBMC (136.3 microg/mL) and increased cell division rate in relation to the mitotic index but did not cause cellular aberrations. Onion and Cheddar flavorings reduced the mitotic index after 24h and 48h exposure, but only Onion flavoring resulted in cellular aberrations and mitotic spindle abnormalities, such as anaphase and telophase bridges, micronucleated cells, conchicine-metaphases and amplifications. So, Butter, Onion and/or Cheddar flavorings caused significant changes in the division of meristematic cells of A. cepa and presented cytotoxic action even on decontrolled proliferating human tumor cells.","['Carvalho, Francisco R S', 'Moura, Antonio G', 'Rodrigues, Gardenia F', 'Nunes, Narcia M F', 'Lima, Daisy J B', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'Costa, Marcilia P', 'Ferreira, Paulo M P', 'Peron, Ana Paula']","['Carvalho FR', 'Moura AG', 'Rodrigues GF', 'Nunes NM', 'Lima DJ', 'Pessoa C', 'Costa MP', 'Ferreira PM', 'Peron AP']","['Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Campus Senador Helvidio Nunes de Barros, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Rua Cicero Duarte, 905, 64607-670 Picos, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Campus Senador Helvidio Nunes de Barros, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Rua Cicero Duarte, 905, 64607-670 Picos, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Campus Senador Helvidio Nunes de Barros, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Rua Cicero Duarte, 905, 64607-670 Picos, PI, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Avenida Universitaria, lado impar, 64049-550 Teresina, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Rua Coronel Nunes de Melo, 1127, 60430-270 Fortaleza, CE, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Rua Coronel Nunes de Melo, 1127, 60430-270 Fortaleza, CE, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Avenida Universitaria, lado impar, 64049-550 Teresina, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Farmacia, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Avenida Universitaria, lado impar, 64049-550 Teresina, PI, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Avenida Universitaria, lado impar, 64049-550 Teresina, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Biofisica e Fisiologia, Laboratorio de Cancerologia Experimental, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Avenida Universitaria, lado impar, 64049-550 Teresina, PI, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Campus Senador Helvidio Nunes de Barros, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Rua Cicero Duarte, 905, 64607-670 Picos, PI, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,An Acad Bras Cienc,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,7503280,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Butter', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cheese', 'Cytotoxins/pharmacology', 'Flavoring Agents/*pharmacology', 'Formazans', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Meristem/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mitotic Index', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', '*Onions/drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts']",,,2016/09/15 06:00,2018/02/28 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2015/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0001-37652016000401419 [pii]', '10.1590/0001-3765201620150553 [doi]']",ppublish,An Acad Bras Cienc. 2016 Sep;88(3):1419-30. doi: 10.1590/0001-3765201620150553.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Flavoring Agents)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '8029-34-3 (Butter)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent mouse studies confirmed that animals irradiated during the fetal stage did not show evidence of radiation effects in lymphocytes and bone marrow cells when they were examined after reaching adulthood. However, in a study of rat mammary epithelial cells, radiation effects were clearly observed after fetal irradiation. These results indicate that the fate of chromosome aberrations induced in a fetus could vary among different tissues. Here we report on translocation frequencies in mouse thyroid cells, which were irradiated at different stages of fetal development. Cytogenetic examination was conducted using fluorescence n situ hybridization (FISH) painting of chromosomes 1 and 3. Adult mice, 2 Gy X-ray irradiated at 15.5-day-old fetuses (E15.5), showed a higher translocation frequency (30/1,155 or 25.3 x 10(-3)) than nonirradiated adult controls (0/1,007 or 0.1 x 10(-3)), and was near that experienced by irradiated mothers and non-pregnant adult females (43/1,244 or 33.7 x 10(-3)). These results are consistent with those seen in rat mammary cells. However, when fetuses were irradiated at an earlier stage of development (E6.5) before thyroid organogenesis, the resulting observed translocation frequency was much lower (3/502 or 5.8 x 10(-3)) than that in E15.5 mice. These results suggest that after fetal irradiation, tissue stem cells record radiation effects primarily when the exposure occurs in cells that have been integrated into tissue. Embryonic stem cells that have been damaged prior to integration into the niche may undergo negative selection due to apoptosis, mitotic death or stem cell-niche cell interactions. The implications of these results in interpreting cancer risks after fetal irradiation are also discussed.","['Hamasaki, K', 'Landes, R D', 'Noda, A', 'Nakamura, N', 'Kodama, Y']","['Hamasaki K', 'Landes RD', 'Noda A', 'Nakamura N', 'Kodama Y']","['Department of aMolecular Biosciences and.', 'b Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 5-2 Hijiyama Park, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 732-0815, Japan; and.', 'c Department of Biostatistics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205.', 'Department of aMolecular Biosciences and.', 'Department of aMolecular Biosciences and.', 'Department of aMolecular Biosciences and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160914,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Development/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thyroid Gland/*cytology/*embryology/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'X-Rays/adverse effects']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/05/24 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/RR14385.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2016 Oct;186(4):360-366. doi: 10.1667/RR14385.1.

CSCs exhibit characteristic slow growth rate and are resistant to conventional chemotherapy/radiotherapy in experimental models. The type of cells commonly employs aberrant activity of the embryonic signal transduction pathways - Notch, Hedgehog (Hh), and Wnt - for uncontrolled proliferation and survival. Areas covered: The following article discusses key genetic and molecular alterations in Notch, Hh and Wnt pathways and drugs targeting the alterations for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Expert opinion: Early signs of signal agent activity have been observed in certain types of leukemia and lymphoma with experimental therapeutics targeting the embryonic pathways in the CSC signaling network. However, clinical development of agents that inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch and Hh signaling appear to be more complex in relapsed or refractory malignancies. A strategy to effectively target signaling may rely on early application of biomarkers representative of the active signaling nodes companion to the molecularly targeted agents. Biomarkers for efficacy could potentially guide selective treatment of hematological malignancies or cancer with drugs that target the embryonic pathways.","['Laranjeira, Angelo B A', 'Yang, Sherry X']","['Laranjeira AB', 'Yang SX']","['a National Clinical Target Validation Laboratory, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis , National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'a National Clinical Target Validation Laboratory, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis , National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160925,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Hedgehog Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects']",,,2016/09/15 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1236785 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Nov;11(11):1071-1080. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1236785.

We show that All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) triggers in APL cells an active chromatin status at the core regulatory region of the PTEN promoter, that allows the binding of the myeloid-regulating transcription factor PU.1, and, in turn, the transcriptional induction of PTEN. ATRA, via PML/RARA degradation, also promotes PTEN nuclear re-localization and decreases expression of the PTEN target Aurora A kinase.

However, about 25% of patients discontinue ibrutinib therapy at a median follow-up of 20 months and many patients discontinue the treatment due to leukemia progression or Richter transformation. Mutations affecting the C481 residue of BTK disrupt ibrutinib binding and have been characterized by us and others as the most common mechanism of ibrutinib resistance. Thus far, all described BTK mutations are located in its kinase domain and mutations outside this domain have never been described. Herein, we report a patient whose CLL progressed, was salvaged with ibrutinib and then relapsed. Serial analysis of samples throughout patient's clinical course identified a structurally novel mutation (BTKT316A) in the SH2 domain, but not kinase domain, of Bruton tyrosine kinase which was associated with disease relapse. Functionally, cells carrying BTKT316A show resistance to ibrutinib at both cellular and molecular levels to a similar extent as BTKC481S. Our study lends further insight into the diverse mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance that has important implications for the development of next-generation BTK inhibitors as well as mutation detection in relapsed patients.","['Sharma, Shruti', 'Galanina, Natalie', 'Guo, Ailin', 'Lee, Jimmy', 'Kadri, Sabah', 'Van Slambrouck, Charles', 'Long, Bradley', 'Wang, Weige', 'Ming, Mei', 'Furtado, Larissa V', 'Segal, Jeremy P', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Venkataraman, Girish', 'Tang, Wei-Jen', 'Lu, Pin', 'Wang, Yue Lynn']","['Sharma S', 'Galanina N', 'Guo A', 'Lee J', 'Kadri S', 'Van Slambrouck C', 'Long B', 'Wang W', 'Ming M', 'Furtado LV', 'Segal JP', 'Stock W', 'Venkataraman G', 'Tang WJ', 'Lu P', 'Wang YL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Center for Research Informatics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Ben-May Department for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'src Homology Domains']",PMC5356593,,2016/09/15 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['11932 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11932 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 18;7(42):68833-68841. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11932.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BTK', 'Richter transformation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib resistance', 'molecular targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, Rv-PEM01-treated cells showed significantly upregulated expression of caspase-3 and 9 and cleaved caspase-3 and 9 compared to the control cells.

Patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may also have the CD20 antigen, which is targeted by rituximab. Although single-group studies suggest that adding rituximab to chemotherapy could improve the outcome in such patients, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned adults (18 to 59 years of age) with CD20-positive, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL to receive chemotherapy with or without rituximab, with event-free survival as the primary end point. Rituximab was given during all treatment phases, for a total of 16 to 18 infusions. RESULTS: From May 2006 through April 2014, a total of 209 patients were enrolled: 105 in the rituximab group and 104 in the control group. After a median follow-up of 30 months, event-free survival was longer in the rituximab group than in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.98; P=0.04); the estimated 2-year event-free survival rates were 65% (95% CI, 56 to 75) and 52% (95% CI, 43 to 63), respectively. Treatment with rituximab remained associated with longer event-free survival in a multivariate analysis. The overall incidence rate of severe adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, but fewer allergic reactions to asparaginase were observed in the rituximab group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding rituximab to the ALL chemotherapy protocol improved the outcome for younger adults with CD20-positive, Ph-negative ALL.

Increased ROS were described to activate formerly quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Mutations in mtDNA were shown to enhance the risk for myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. However, the complex relationship between mtDNA variations, ROS and aging of the hematopoietic system is not fully understood.Herein, three mouse strains with mtDNA polymorphisms in genes of respiratory chain complexes I (ND4), III (CYTB) and IV (COX3) were compared to a reference strain during aging. Analysis focused on ROS and ATP levels, bone marrow composition and blood counts. Additionally, hematopoietic restoration capacity following cytotoxic stress was tested.Mice with polymorphisms in ND4 and CYTB gene had significantly decreasing ROS levels in bone marrow cells during aging, without effecting ATP levels. In addition, the frequency of stem and progenitor cells increased during aging but the amount of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood decreased during aging.In summary, the presence of mtDNA polymorphisms affecting the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV was associated with altered ROS levels as well as changes in BM and peripheral blood composition during aging.","['Kretzschmar, Christin', 'Roolf, Catrin', 'Timmer, Katrin', 'Sekora, Anett', 'Knubel, Gudrun', 'Murua Escobar, Hugo', 'Fuellen, Georg', 'Ibrahim, Saleh M', 'Tiedge, Markus', 'Baltrusch, Simone', 'Jaster, Robert', 'Kohling, Rudiger', 'Junghanss, Christian']","['Kretzschmar C', 'Roolf C', 'Timmer K', 'Sekora A', 'Knubel G', 'Murua Escobar H', 'Fuellen G', 'Ibrahim SM', 'Tiedge M', 'Baltrusch S', 'Jaster R', 'Kohling R', 'Junghanss C']","['Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Division of Gastroenterology, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Oscar Langendorff Institute of Physiology, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III - Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, Rostock, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Age Factors', 'Aging/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Electron Transport Complex III/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Genes, Mitochondrial', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC5342679,,2016/09/15 06:00,2018/02/09 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['11952 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11952 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 15;7(46):74460-74472. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11952.,,"['0 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (cyclooxygenase-3)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 7.1.1.8 (Electron Transport Complex III)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gerotarget', '*ROS', '*aging', '*hematopoiesis', '*mtDNA', '*stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of DNMT3A mutation burden in CN-AML remains unclear. In this study, 81 DNMT3A mutated adult CN-AML patients in their first complete remission (CR) were enrolled at our center from March 2005 to May 2015. All patients were identified as having DNMT3A exon 23 mutations, and R882H was the most frequent variant (n=49, 60.49%). A total of 48 patients (48/81, 59.3%) were found to have DNMT3A mutations upon achieving CR. At the final follow-up exam, 40 patients remained in CR, 8 of which (8/81, 9.9%) were found to still have DNMT3A mutations. Analysis of the order of NPM1, FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations for different disease statuses revealed that DNMT3A might be the earliest mutation in leukemic cells. In addition, we determined the possible gene aberrations in 12 de novo and 2 relapsed samples using next-generation sequencing. NPM1 (5/12, 41.7%), FLT3-ITD (5/12, 41.7%) and CEBPA mutations (4/12, 33.3%) were the most frequent coexisting mutations. In the relapsed samples, additional genes aberrations could be observed, and some of them were never reported in AML patients. The 2-year overall survival (2-OS) for 81 DNMT3A mutated CN-AML patients was 39.0%. No differences was found in 2-OS (38.2% vs 41.6%, P=0.2256) and 2-year disease free survival (2-DFS: 28.5% vs 34.3%, P=0.1831) between patients with negative (n=33) and positive DNMT3A mutation findings (n=48) at the first CR. In summary, our findings indicated that DNMT3A mutation burden could persist in adult DNMT3A mutated CN-AML patients in long-term remission and that DNMT3A mutation was the early event in the development of leukemic cells.","['Sun, Yanjun', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Xu, Ting', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Sun, Aining', 'Chen, Suning', 'Wu, Depei', 'Xu, Yang']","['Sun Y', 'Shen H', 'Xu T', 'Yang Z', 'Qiu H', 'Sun A', 'Chen S', 'Wu D', 'Xu Y']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.

Further, effective treatment strategies for relapsed/refractory ALL remain elusive. We previously uncovered that ALL cells are prone to apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated mechanisms. We investigated the antineoplastic activity of pevonedistat((R)), a novel NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor that targets E3 cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) dependent proteasomal protein degradation, in ALL. Herein, we report that pevonedistat induces apoptosis in ALL cells by dysregulating the translational machinery leading to induction of proteotoxic/ER stress and UPR-mediated cell death. Mechanistically, pevonedistat led to P-eIF2a dephosphorylation causing atypical proteotoxic/ER stress from failure to halt protein translation via the UPR and upregulation of mTOR/p70S6K. Additional studies revealed that pevonedistat re-balanced the homeostasis of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins to favor cell death through altered expression and/or activity of Mcl-1, NOXA, and BIM, suggesting that pevonedistat has a ""priming"" effect on ALL by altering the apoptotic threshold through modulation of Mcl-1 activity. Further, we demonstrated that pevonedistat synergizes with selected anti-leukemic agents in vitro, and prolongs survival of NSG mice engrafted with ALL cells, lending support for the use of pevonedistat as part of a multi-agent approach.","['Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Zheng, Shuhua', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'DeSalvo, Joanna', 'Swords, Ronan T', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Leclerc GM', 'Zheng S', 'Leclerc GJ', 'DeSalvo J', 'Swords RT', 'Barredo JC']","['Departments of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.', 'The Sheila and David Fuente Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.', 'Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, United States.

Through EGFR wt/mutant engineered isogenic BaF3 cell lines we confirmed the irreversible binding mode of Ibrutinib with EGFR wt/mutant kinase via Cys797. However, comparing to typical irreversible EGFR inhibitor, such as WZ4002, the washing-out experiments revealed a much less efficient covalent binding for Ibrutinib. The biochemical binding affinity examination in the EGFR L858R/T790M kinase revealed that, comparing to more efficient irreversible inhibitor WZ4002 (Kd: 0.074 muM), Ibrutinib exhibited less efficient binding (Kd: 0.18 muM). An X-ray crystal structure of EGFR (T790M) in complex with Ibrutinib exhibited a unique DFG-in/c-Helix-out inactive binding conformation, which partially explained the less efficiency of covalent binding and provided insight for further development of highly efficient irreversible binding inhibitor for the EGFR mutant kinase. These results also imply that, unlike the canonical irreversible inhibitor, sustained effective concentration might be required for Ibrutinib in order to achieve the maximal efficacy in the clinic application against EGFR driven NSCLC.","['Wang, Aoli', 'Yan, Xiao-E', 'Wu, Hong', 'Wang, Wenchao', 'Hu, Chen', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Zhao, Zheng', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Li, Xixiang', 'Wang, Li', 'Wang, Beilei', 'Ye, Zi', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Wang, Chu', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Weisberg, Ellen L', 'Chen, Liang', 'Liu, Jing', 'Yun, Cai-Hong', 'Liu, Qingsong']","['Wang A', 'Yan XE', 'Wu H', 'Wang W', 'Hu C', 'Chen C', 'Zhao Z', 'Zhao P', 'Li X', 'Wang L', 'Wang B', 'Ye Z', 'Wang J', 'Wang C', 'Zhang W', 'Gray NS', 'Weisberg EL', 'Chen L', 'Liu J', 'Yun CH', 'Liu Q']","['High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Anhui, Hefei 230031, P.

Initially, the 48-yr-old female diagnosed with high-risk APL had achieved complete molecular remission after standard treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy according to the AIDA (ATRA plus idarubicin) protocol. Thirteen months after the start of ATRA maintenance, the patient suffered clinically overt meningeal relapse along with minute molecular traces of PML/RARA (promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha) in the bone marrow. Following treatment with arsenic trioxide and ATRA in combination with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate, the patient achieved a complete molecular remission in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow, which currently lasts for 2 yr after completion of therapy. Whole-exome sequencing and subsequent ultradeep targeted resequencing revealed a heterozygous FLT3-TKD mutation in CSF leukemic cells (p.D835Y, c.2503G>T, 1000/1961 reads [51%]), which was undetectable in the concurrent bone marrow sample. Interestingly, the FLT3-TKD mutated meningeal clone originated from a small bone marrow subclone present in a variant allele frequency of 0.4% (6/1553 reads) at initial diagnosis. This case highlights the concept of clonal evolution with a subclone harboring an additional mutation being selected as the ""fittest"" and leading to meningeal relapse. It also further supports earlier suggestions that FLT3 mutations may play a role for migration and clonal expansion in the CSF sanctuary site.","['Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Weichert, Wilko', 'Endris, Volker', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Hutter, Barbara', 'Hundemer, Michael', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Bochtler T', 'Frohling S', 'Weichert W', 'Endris V', 'Thiede C', 'Hutter B', 'Hundemer M', 'Ho AD', 'Kramer A']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;; Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;; Section for Personalized Oncology, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;; DKFZ-Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (HIPO), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Institute of Pathology, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany;; Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany;', 'Division of Applied Bioinformatics, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;; Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,,,PMC5002926,,2016/09/15 06:00,2016/09/15 06:01,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1101/mcs.a001123 [doi]', 'Bochtlermcs001123 [pii]']",ppublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2016 Sep;2(5):a001123. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a001123.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],['leukemia'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C609T polymorphism of the NQO1 gene, designated NQO1*2, significantly reduces its enzymatic activity due to rapid degradation of protein. Since down regulation of NQO1 mRNA expression correlates with increased susceptibility for developing different types of cancers, we investigated the link between leukemia and the NQO1*2 genotype by mining a web-based microarray dataset, ONCOMINE. Phytochemicals prevent DNA damage through activation of phase II detoxification enzymes including NQO1. Whether NQO1 expression/activity in leukemia cells that carry the labile NQO1*2 genotype can be induced by broccoli-derived phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) is currently unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ONCOMINE query showed that: (1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia are associated with reduced NQO1 levels, and (2) under-expressed NQO1 was found in human HL-60 leukemia cell line containing the heterozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism. We examined induction of NQO1 activity/expression by SFN in HL-60 cells. A dose-dependent increase in NQO1 level/activity is accompanied by upregulation of the transcription factor, Nrf2, following 1-10 muM SFN treatment. Treatment with 25 microM SFN drastically reduced NQO1 levels, inhibited cell proliferation, caused sub-G1 cell arrest, and induced apoptosis, and a decrease in the levels of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB). CONCLUSIONS: Up to 10 muM of SFN increases NQO1 expression and suppresses HL-60 cell proliferation whereas >/= 25 muM of SFN induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Further, SFN treatment restores NQO1 activity/levels in HL-60 cells expressing the NQO1*2 genotype.","['Wu, Joseph M', 'Oraee, Ardalan', 'Doonan, Barbara B', 'Pinto, John T', 'Hsieh, Tze-Chen']","['Wu JM', 'Oraee A', 'Doonan BB', 'Pinto JT', 'Hsieh TC']","['Room 147, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Basic Sciences Building, New York Medical College, 15 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.', 'Room 147, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Basic Sciences Building, New York Medical College, 15 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.', 'Room 147, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Basic Sciences Building, New York Medical College, 15 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.', 'Room 147, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Basic Sciences Building, New York Medical College, 15 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.', 'Room 147, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Basic Sciences Building, New York Medical College, 15 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,PMC5020469,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0056-z [doi]', '56 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 13;5(1):27. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0056-z. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60', 'Leukemia', 'NQO1', 'Sulforaphane']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, protein expression of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9 and -14 was qualitatively evaluated in 17 EFT and MB samples of children and adolescent by western blotting and optical densitometry, and the level of gene expression of some MMPs was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Five MB samples (45.4%) presented expression of the five MMPs and six samples (54.6%) presented expression of at least one of them. Four EFT samples (66.6%) presented expression of MMP-2, -9 and -14, and two samples (33.4%) presented expression of at least one of these MMPs, whereas the presence of MMP-1 and -3 was not observed.

AML-MLL tumor cells are resistant to current genotoxic therapies because of an attenuated response by p53, a protein that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In addition to chemicals that damage DNA, efforts have focused on targeting DNA repair enzymes as a general chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment. Here, we found that inhibition of the kinase ATR, which is the primary sensor of DNA replication stress, induced chromosomal breakage and death of mouse AML(MLL) cells (with an MLL-ENL fusion and a constitutively active N-RAS independently of p53. Moreover, ATR inhibition as a single agent exhibited antitumoral activity, both reducing tumor burden after establishment and preventing tumors from growing, in an immunocompetent allograft mouse model of AML(MLL) and in xenografts of a human AML-MLL cell line. We also found that inhibition of ATM, a kinase that senses DNA double-strand breaks, also promoted the survival of the AML(MLL) mice. Collectively, these data indicated that ATR or ATM inhibition represent potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AML, especially MLL-driven leukemias.","['Morgado-Palacin, Isabel', 'Day, Amanda', 'Murga, Matilde', 'Lafarga, Vanesa', 'Anton, Marta Elena', 'Tubbs, Anthony', 'Chen, Hua Tang', 'Ergan, Aysegul', 'Anderson, Rhonda', 'Bhandoola, Avinash', 'Pike, Kurt G', 'Barlaam, Bernard', 'Cadogan, Elaine', 'Wang, Xi', 'Pierce, Andrew J', 'Hubbard, Chad', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Nussenzweig, Andre', 'Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar']","['Morgado-Palacin I', 'Day A', 'Murga M', 'Lafarga V', 'Anton ME', 'Tubbs A', 'Chen HT', 'Ergan A', 'Anderson R', 'Bhandoola A', 'Pike KG', 'Barlaam B', 'Cadogan E', 'Wang X', 'Pierce AJ', 'Hubbard C', 'Armstrong SA', 'Nussenzweig A', 'Fernandez-Capetillo O']","['Genomic Instability Group; Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO); Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Genomic Instability Group; Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO); Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group; Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO); Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group; Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO); Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Cambridge, CB4 0WG, UK.', 'AstraZeneca, Cambridge, CB4 0WG, UK.', 'AstraZeneca, Cambridge, CB4 0WG, UK.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Cambridge, CB4 0WG, UK.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity; National Cancer Institute; National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Genomic Instability Group; Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO); Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, 17165 Solna, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,IM,"['Animals', '*Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5066844,"['AZD0156 was provided by AstraZeneca to the investigators under terms of an MCRADA', 'agreement with the NCI.

We explored the prognostic value of the expression of 72 genes involved in various aspects of DNA replication in a set of 198 AML patients treated by cytarabine-based chemotherapy. We unveiled that high expression of the DNA replication checkpoint gene CHEK1 is a prognostic marker associated with shorter overall, event-free, and relapse-free survivals and determined that the expression of CHEK1 can predict more frequent and earlier postremission relapse. CHEK1 encodes checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is activated by the kinase ATR when DNA replication is impaired by DNA damage. High abundance of CHK1 in AML patient cells correlated with higher clonogenic ability and more efficient DNA replication fork progression upon cytarabine treatment. Exposing the patient cells with the high abundance of CHK1 to SCH900776, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of CHK1, reduced clonogenic ability and progression of DNA replication in the presence of cytarabine. These results indicated that some AML cells rely on an efficient CHK1-mediated replication stress response for viability and that therapeutic strategies that inhibit CHK1 could extend current cytarabine-based treatments and overcome drug resistance. Furthermore, monitoring CHEK1 expression could be used both as a predictor of outcome and as a marker to select AML patients for CHK1 inhibitor treatments.","['David, Laure', 'Fernandez-Vidal, Anne', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Grgurevic, Srdana', 'Lepage, Benoit', 'Deshaies, Dominique', 'Prade, Nais', 'Cartel, Maelle', 'Larrue, Clement', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Cazaux, Christophe', 'Didier, Christine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Sebastien']","['David L', 'Fernandez-Vidal A', 'Bertoli S', 'Grgurevic S', 'Lepage B', 'Deshaies D', 'Prade N', 'Cartel M', 'Larrue C', 'Sarry JE', 'Delabesse E', 'Cazaux C', 'Didier C', 'Recher C', 'Manenti S', 'Hoffmann JS']","[""Equipe Labellisee, La Ligue Contre Le Cancer, Toulouse, France.

This article focuses on novel aspects of the pharmacology and molecular mechanisms of histamine receptors that should be contemplated for optimizing current therapies, repositioning histaminergic ligands for new therapeutic uses, or even including agonists of the histaminergic system in the treatment of different pathologies such as leukemia or neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, new signaling phenomena related to H1 and H2 receptors have been described that make them suitable for novel therapeutic approaches. Crosstalk between histamine receptors and other membrane or nuclear receptors can be envisaged as a way to modulate other signaling pathways and to potentiate the efficacy of drugs acting on different receptors. Likewise, biased signaling at histamine receptors seems to be a pharmacological feature that can be exploited to investigate nontraditional therapeutic uses for H1 and H2 biased agonists in malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and to avoid undesired side effects when used in standard treatments. It is hoped that the molecular mechanisms discussed in this review contribute to a better understanding of the different aspects involved in histamine receptor pharmacology, which in turn will contribute to increased drug efficacy, avoidance of adverse effects, or repositioning of histaminergic ligands.","['Monczor, Federico', 'Fernandez, Natalia']","['Monczor F', 'Fernandez N']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacologicas, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina monczorf@ffyb.uba.ar.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacologicas, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160913,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Histamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', '*Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, Histamine H1/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.116.105981 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.116.105981 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2016 Nov;90(5):640-648. doi: 10.1124/mol.116.105981.

The diagnosis is often suspected when there is leukocytosis with left shift and basophilia. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires a demonstration of BCR-ABL by polymerase chain reaction. Using data from the William Beaumont laboratory data registry, we conducted a retrospective review of all the orders for BCR-ABL tests sent to the clinical pathology laboratory between March 11, 2014 and September 12, 2014. We concluded that the presence of concurrent neutrophilia and basophilia has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 69.15% to 100%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 93.15% to 100%) in the initial diagnosis of CML. Our results suggest that the presence of both neutrophilia and basophilia should be used as a threshold for the placement of orders for BCR-ABL in the initial diagnosis of CML in patients with leukocytosis with left shift and provide a basis for a reduction in health care spending. Restricting BCR-ABL tests to this population would save approximately $198 million annually in national health care spending.","['Ogunleye, Foluso', 'Ibrahim, Mohammed', 'Allen, Emily', 'Brennan, Neil', 'Huang, James', 'Yu, Zhou', 'Huben, Marianne', 'Jaiyesimi, Ishmael']","['Ogunleye F', 'Ibrahim M', 'Allen E', 'Brennan N', 'Huang J', 'Yu Z', 'Huben M', 'Jaiyesimi I']","['William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.', 'William Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,IM,"['Basophils/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Laboratories, Hospital', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/09/15 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/09/15 06:00'],"['2016/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['JOP.2016.014449 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2016.014449 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2016 Dec;12(12):e1001-e1005. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.014449.

Pharmacologic inhibitors of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) are emerging as potential histone methylation reversal agents for the treatment of various solid tumors and leukemia; however, the surprisingly small set of mRNA targets identified with EZH2 knockdown suggests novel mechanisms contribute to their antitumorigenic effects. Here, 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase and EZH2 histone lysine-N-methyltransferase, significantly reprograms noncoding microRNA (miRNA) expression and dampens TGFbeta1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) signals in pancreatic cancer. In particular, miR-663a and miR-4787-5p were identified as PDAC-downregulated miRNAs that were reactivated by DZNep to directly target TGFbeta1 for RNA interference. Lentiviral overexpression of miR-663a and miR-4787-5p reduced TGFbeta1 synthesis and secretion in PDAC cells and partially phenocopied DZNep's EMT-resisting effects, whereas locked nucleic acid (LNA) antagomiRNAs counteracted them. DZNep, miR-663a, and miR-4787-5p reduced tumor burden in vivo and metastases in an orthotopic mouse pancreatic tumor model. Taken together, these findings suggest the epigenetic reprogramming of miRNAs by synthetic histone methylation reversal agents as a viable approach to attenuate TGFbeta1-induced EMT features in human PDAC and uncover putative miRNA targets involved in the process. IMPLICATIONS: The findings support the potential for synthetic histone methylation reversal agents to be included in future epigenetic-chemotherapeutic combination therapies for pancreatic cancer.

Given that decitabine is clinically active in AML and with hypomethylating activity distinct from cytotoxic chemotherapy, we hypothesized that 1 year of maintenance therapy would improve disease-free survival (DFS) for AML patients <60 years, who did not receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation in CR1. After blood count recovery from final consolidation, patients received decitabine at 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 4-5 days, every 6 weeks for eight cycles. One hundred and thirty-four patients received decitabine and 85 (63%) had favorable risk AML. The median number of cycles received was 7 (range: 1-8) and the primary reason for discontinuation was relapse. DFS at 1 year and 3 years was 79% and 54%, respectively. These results are similar to the outcomes in the historical control comprising similar patients treated on recent CALGB trials. Thus, maintenance with decitabine provided no benefit overall. Standard use of decitabine maintenance in younger AML patients in CR1 is not warranted.

Its influence on the cell cycle was also observed. Moreover, we have confirmed that antiproliferative activity towards cancer cells is due to LAP inhibition. Docking simulation based on positioning compound 3b into the LAP active site was performed to explore the possible binding mode. The compound was able to form hydrogen bonds with Gly362 and coordinate zinc ions, which was previously suggested to be essential for inhibitory activity. Compound 3b was also characterized with a good selectivity index for cancer versus normal mammalian cells.

Previously, several PEGylated LLP2A conjugates were evaluated in vivo as imaging agents for the detection of lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma and melanoma tumours via NIR-fluorescence, (111)In-SPECT, and (64)Cu- and (68)Ga-PET imaging. Despite these successes, to date there is no report of an (18)F-labeled LLP2A conjugate. Notably, fluorine-18 is a preferred radionuclide for PET imaging, yet its short half-life and general inactivity under aqueous conditions present challenges for peptide labeling. A simple method for labeling complex biomolecules can be achieved with arylboronic acids that readily capture aqueous [(18)F]-fluoride ion resulting in an (18)F-labeled aryltrifluoroborate ([(18)F]-ArBF3(-)) radioprosthetic group. Herein, we present the first radiosynthesis of an (18)F-labeled LLP2A conjugate by both one-step (18)F-labeling and one-pot two-step (18)F-labeling post-'click' conjugation of the (18)F-alkynyl-ArBF3(-) prosthetic. Competition with a fluorescent conjugate of LLP2A demonstrated specific binding of the non-radioactive isotopolog ArBF3(-)-PEG2-LLP2A to alpha4beta1 integrin-expressing MOLT-4 leukemia cells, as evidenced and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. This work provides a key first step in the development of an expanding library of [(18)F]-R-BF3(-)-LLP2A radiotracers for PET imaging.","['Walker, Daniel', 'Li, Ying', 'Roxin, Aron', 'Schaffer, Paul', 'Adam, Michael J', 'Perrin, David M']","['Walker D', 'Li Y', 'Roxin A', 'Schaffer P', 'Adam MJ', 'Perrin DM']","['Chemistry Department, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada.', 'Chemistry Department, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada.', 'Chemistry Department, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada.', 'Triumf, 4004 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 2A3, Canada.', 'Triumf, 4004 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 2A3, Canada.', 'Chemistry Department, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study recruited 55 patients (median age, 48 years; age range, 20-66 years; 30 men and 25 women; 34 with acute myeloid leukemia and 21 with acute lymphoid leukemia). Hyperfractionated TBI (HTBI) (1.2 Gy thrice daily for 4 days [for a total dose of 14.4 Gy] from day -12 to day -9) was administered to 29 patients. Single-dose TBI (STBI) (8 Gy, at a median dose rate of 10.7 cGy/min on day -9) was given to 26 patients. RESULTS: All patients achieved primary, sustained engraftment with full donor-type chimerism. At 10 years, the overall cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality was 11% (SE, +/-0.1%). It was 7% (SE, +/-0.2%) after HTBI and 15% (SE, +/-0.5%) after STBI (P=.3). The overall cumulative incidence of relapse was 33% (SE, +/-0.5). It was 13% (SE, +/-0.5%) after HTBI and 46% (SE, +/-1%) after STBI (P=.02). The overall probability of disease-free survival (DFS) was 59% (SE, +/-7%). It was 67% (SE, +/-0.84%) after HTBI and 37% (SE, +/-1.4%) after STBI (P=.01). Multivariate analyses showed the TBI schedule was the only risk factor that significantly affected relapse and DFS (P=.01 and P=.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute leukemia, HTBI is more efficacious than STBI in eradicating minimal residual disease after HLA-matched T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, thus affecting DFS.","['Aristei, Cynthia', 'Carotti, Alessandra', 'Palazzari, Elisa', 'Amico, Lucia', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Perrucci, Elisabetta', 'Falcinelli, Lorenzo', 'Lancellotta, Valentina', 'Palumbo, Isabella', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Merluzzi, Mara', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio']","['Aristei C', 'Carotti A', 'Palazzari E', 'Amico L', 'Ruggeri L', 'Perrucci E', 'Falcinelli L', 'Lancellotta V', 'Palumbo I', 'Falzetti F', 'Aversa F', 'Merluzzi M', 'Velardi A', 'Martelli MF']","['Radiation Oncology Section, Department of Surgery and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia and Perugia General Hospital, Perugia, Italy.

In this study we used an established pre-clinical model of induction therapy to increase our understanding of the effect of engraftment and chemotherapy on clonal selection and acquisition of drug resistance in vivo. Immune-deficient mice were engrafted with patient diagnostic specimens and exposed to a repeated combination therapy consisting of vincristine, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase and daunorubicin. Any re-emergence of disease following therapy was shown to be associated with resistance to dexamethasone, no resistance was observed to the other three drugs. Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements closely matched those in respective diagnosis and relapse patient specimens, highlighting that these clonal markers do not fully reflect the biological changes associated with drug resistance. Gene expression profiling revealed the significant underlying heterogeneity of dexamethasone-resistant xenografts. Alterations were observed in a large number of biological pathways, yet no dominant signature was common to all lines. These findings indicate that the biological changes associated with T-ALL relapse and resistance are stochastic and highly individual, and underline the importance of using sophisticated molecular techniques or single cell analyses in developing personalized approaches to therapy.","['Yadav, Babasaheb D', 'Samuels, Amy L', 'Wells, Julia E', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Bendak, Katerina', 'Anderson, Denise', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Cole, Catherine H', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Yadav BD', 'Samuels AL', 'Wells JE', 'Sutton R', 'Venn NC', 'Bendak K', 'Anderson D', 'Marshall GM', 'Cole CH', 'Beesley AH', 'Kees UR', 'Lock RB']","[""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", ""Molecular Diagnostics, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Molecular Diagnostics, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Division of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'School of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated', 'Clone Cells', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5312271,,2016/09/14 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['11233 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11233 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):58728-42. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11233.,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'pre-clinical testing', 'relapse', 'xenograft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, newly identified genetic alterations have been studied, among them the IKZF1 deletion. IKZF1 encodes IKAROS, a zinc finger protein that plays an important role in hematopoiesis involving the regulation process of adhesion, cellular migration, and as a tumor suppressor. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the impact of IKAROS deletion in the evolution and prognosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single center we prospectively studied patients diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and screened for IKZF1 deletion using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method. We did a descriptive analysis of patients positive for the IKZF1 deletion to determine its impact on the evolution of the disease and survival rate. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2015, 16 Mexican mestizo patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were prospectively screened for IKZF1 deletion; seven (43%) were positive and were included for further analysis. The age range of patients was 13-60 years; six were males and one female. All cases had type B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Of the seven patients, two died, three were lost to follow-up, and two continue in complete remission with treatment. Results are worse than those in a group of patients with non-mutated IKAROS B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously studied in our center. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small sample, the presence of IKAROS deletion in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients could represent a poor-prognosis marker and was probably related to therapy failure. It is also possible that this variant of leukemia may be more prevalent in Mexico. More studies are needed to define the role of IKZF1 deletion in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the real prevalence of the disease in different populations.","['Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo Jose', 'Cantero-Fortiz, Yahveth', 'Leon-Pena, Andres Aurelio', 'Leon-Gonzalez, Monica', 'Nunez-Cortes, Ana Karen', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo Jose']","['Ruiz-Delgado GJ', 'Cantero-Fortiz Y', 'Leon-Pena AA', 'Leon-Gonzalez M', 'Nunez-Cortes AK', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Indians, North American/genetics', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2016 Jul-Aug;68(4):210-4.,,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the best of our knowledge, whether adult oncologists in the United States have adopted this approach to ALL in AYA patients is currently unknown. The objective of the current study was to provide a population-based description of ALL treatment patterns in AYA individuals over the past decade. METHODS: Data regarding AYA patients aged 15 to 39 years and diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 while living in the Greater Bay Area were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (GBACR). Treating facilities were designated as pediatric or adult centers; induction treatment regimens were abstracted from registry text data fields. RESULTS: Of 304 patients diagnosed in the GBACR catchment region, complete treatment data were available for 229 (75%). The location of care was identified for 296 patients (97%) treated at 31 unique centers. Approximately 70% of AYA patients received induction therapy at an adult treatment center. All AYA patients who were treated at pediatric centers received pediatric ALL regimens. Among AYA patients treated by adult oncologists with complete treatment data, none received a pediatric regimen before 2008. Between 2008 and 2012, while the US Adult Intergroup C10403 pediatric-inspired ALL protocol was open to accrual, 31% of AYA patients treated by adult oncologists received pediatric regimens.

We have previously demonstrated that a 22-mer peptide derived from fibronectin, FNIII14, can inhibit cell adhesion through the inactivation of beta1 integrin; when coadministered with cytarabine, FNIII14 completely eradicates acute myelogenous leukemia by suppressing CAM-DR. In this study, we show that our FNIII14 peptide also enhances chemotherapy efficacy in solid tumors. Coadministration of FNIII14 synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and aclarubicin in mammary tumor and melanoma cells, respectively. The solid tumor cell chemosensitization induced by FNIII14 is dependent upon the upregulation and activation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Furthermore, the metastasis of tumor cells derived from ventrally transplanted mammary tumor grafts is suppressed by the coadministration of FNIII14 and doxorubicin. These results suggest that the coadministration of our FNIII14 peptide with chemotherapy could achieve efficient solid tumor eradication by increasing chemosensitivity and decreasing metastasis. The major causes of tumor recurrence are the existence of chemotherapy-resistant primary tumor cells and the establishment of secondary metastatic lesions. As such, coadministering FNIII14 with anti-cancer drugs could provide a promising new approach to improve the prognosis of patients with solid tumors.","['Iyoda, Takuya', 'Nagamine, Yumi', 'Nakane, Yoshitomi', 'Tokita, Yuya', 'Akari, Shougo', 'Otsuka, Kazuki', 'Fujita, Motomichi', 'Itagaki, Keisuke', 'Takizawa, You-Ichi', 'Orita, Hiroaki', 'Owaki, Toshiyuki', 'Taira, Jyunichi', 'Hayashi, Ryo', 'Kodama, Hiroaki', 'Fukai, Fumio']","['Iyoda T', 'Nagamine Y', 'Nakane Y', 'Tokita Y', 'Akari S', 'Otsuka K', 'Fujita M', 'Itagaki K', 'Takizawa Y', 'Orita H', 'Owaki T', 'Taira J', 'Hayashi R', 'Kodama H', 'Fukai F']","['Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Translational Research Center, Research Institutes for Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Patho-Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Translational Research Center, Research Institutes for Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage']",PMC5021278,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/14 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0162525 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-14530 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Sep 13;11(9):e0162525. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0162525. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (fibronectin type III like peptide, human)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7420-9534'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discover that feedback activation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling in breast cancer limits the response to HDAC inhibition. Mechanistically, HDAC inhibition increases histone acetylation at the LIFR gene promoter, which recruits bromodomain protein BRD4, upregulates LIFR expression, and activates JAK1-STAT3 signaling. Importantly, JAK1 or BRD4 inhibition sensitizes breast cancer to HDAC inhibitors, implicating combination inhibition of HDAC with JAK1 or BRD4 as potential therapies for breast cancer.","['Zeng, Hanlin', 'Qu, Jia', 'Jin, Nan', 'Xu, Jun', 'Lin, Chenchu', 'Chen, Yi', 'Yang, Xinying', 'He, Xiang', 'Tang, Shuai', 'Lan, Xiaojing', 'Yang, Xiaotong', 'Chen, Ziqi', 'Huang, Min', 'Ding, Jian', 'Geng, Meiyu']","['Zeng H', 'Qu J', 'Jin N', 'Xu J', 'Lin C', 'Chen Y', 'Yang X', 'He X', 'Tang S', 'Lan X', 'Yang X', 'Chen Z', 'Huang M', 'Ding J', 'Geng M']","['Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.

These alterations are thought to promote formation of inhibitory NK-target cell synapses, in which killer cell degranulation is attenuated. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be effective in treating AML, through restoration of NK cell lytic activity. Similarly, agents that augment NK-cell-activating signals within the immunological synapse may provide some therapeutic benefit. However, the receptor-ligand interactions that critically dictate NK cell function in AML remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that CD112/CD155 expression is required for DNAM-1-dependent killing of AML cells. Indeed, the low, or absent, expression of CD112/CD155 on multiple AML cell lines resulted in failure to stimulate optimal NK cell function. Importantly, isolated clones with low CD112/155 expression were resistant to NK cell killing while those expressing abundant levels of CD112/155 were highly susceptible. Attenuated NK cell killing in the absence of CD112/CD155 originated from decreased NK-target cell conjugation. Furthermore, we reveal by time-lapse microscopy, a significant increase in NK cell 'failed killing' in the absence of DNAM-1 ligands. Consequently, NK cells preferentially lysed ligand-expressing cells within heterogeneous populations, driving clonal selection of CD112/CD155-negative blasts upon NK cell attack. Taken together, we identify reduced CD155 expression as a major NK cell escape mechanism in AML and an opportunity for targeted immunotherapy.","['Kearney, Conor J', 'Ramsbottom, Kelly M', 'Voskoboinik, Ilia', 'Darcy, Phillip K', 'Oliaro, Jane']","['Kearney CJ', 'Ramsbottom KM', 'Voskoboinik I', 'Darcy PK', 'Oliaro J']","['Immune Defense Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Immune Defense Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Center , East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Killer Cell Biology Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Immunotherapy Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Immune Defense Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160627,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,PMC5007960,,2016/09/14 06:00,2016/09/14 06:01,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1196308 [doi]', '1196308 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Jun 27;5(8):e1196308. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1196308. eCollection 2016 Aug.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CD155', '*DNAM-1', '*cancer', '*immunological synapse', '*immunotherapy', '*lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is one of the most common causes of human gastroenteritis in the world. The aim of this study was to present a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), who was infected with Campylobacter jejuni. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the medical records of a pediatric ALL patient with bacteremia caused by C. jejuni, who was diagnosed at Amir hospital, Shiraz, Iran. This 14-year-old male visited the emergency department of Amir hospital with night sweats, severe polar high-grade fever, reduced appetite, and nausea in August 2013. Given the suspected presence of an anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganism, aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were performed using an automated blood cultivator, the BACTEC 9240 system. In order to characterize the isolate, diagnostic biochemical tests were used. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done with the disk diffusion method. The primary culture was found to be positive for Campylobacter, and the subculture of the solid plate yielded a confluent growth of colonies typical for Campylobacter, which was identified as C. jejuni by morphological and biochemical tests.

METHODS: This is a cohort study of patients submitted to surgery for MPM from January 2007 to December 2013. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate-adjusted comparisons by EORTC prognostic score for OS were accomplished using Cox method. Adjusted models included the following clinical variables: kind of procedure, smoking habit, asbestos exposure, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI), clinical tumor stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, dyspnoea, chest pain and haematological variables according to the score features. Nomenclature of the surgical procedures matches the International Association for the Study Lung Cancer (IASLC)/International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMIG). RESULTS: One-hundred sixty-six consecutive cases were collected: the median age at surgery was 73 years and 123 patients (75%) had a history of asbestos exposure. Ninty patients (54%) were submitted to a palliative/diagnostic thoracoscopy, 30 to pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), and 6 to extra-pleural pneumonectomy (EPP). Clinical TNM stages were as follows: 99 (60%) stage I-II, 34 (20%) stage III and 33 (20%) stage IV. The median follow-up (FU) was 19 months [interquartile range (IQR), 9-31 months] and the FU-completeness was 98%. By the end of the study 130 patients died (78%). One- and 3-year OS was 60% and 36%, respectively. Patients submitted to EPP and P/D showed a better survival (P=0.013). Multivariable model showed an independent prognostic value of EORTC score (HR =2.86, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, aggressive surgical approaches, although not radical, may still be beneficial. The EORTC prognostic index proved to be an independent prognostic factor in our cohort of patients and therefore is a reliable and valid instrument that may be implemented in the daily practice.","['Sandri, Alberto', 'Guerrera, Francesco', 'Roffinella, Matteo', 'Olivetti, Stefania', 'Costardi, Lorena', 'Oliaro, Alberto', 'Filosso, Pier Luigi', 'Lausi, Paolo Olivo', 'Ruffini, Enrico']","['Sandri A', 'Guerrera F', 'Roffinella M', 'Olivetti S', 'Costardi L', 'Oliaro A', 'Filosso PL', 'Lausi PO', 'Ruffini E']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Thorac Dis,Journal of thoracic disease,101533916,,,PMC4999738,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],2016/09/14 06:00,2016/09/14 06:01,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/jtd.2016.07.55 [doi]', 'jtd-08-08-2121 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Dis. 2016 Aug;8(8):2121-7. doi: 10.21037/jtd.2016.07.55.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer and Leukaemia Group B (CALGB)', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)', 'Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)', 'mesothelioma and surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease biology varies based on the etiology and treatment modalities patients receive for their primary condition. Topoisomerase II inhibitor therapy results in balanced translocations. Alkylating agents, characteristically, give rise to more complex karyotypes and mutations in p53. Other etiologies include radiation therapy, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and telomere dysfunction. Poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities are more prevalent than they are in de novo leukemias and the prognosis of these patients is uniformly dismal. Outcome varies according to cytogenetic risk group. Treatment recommendations should be based on performance status and karyotype.

IDH1/2 mutations define distinct subsets of cancers, including low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, chondrosarcomas, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and hematologic malignancies. Somatic point mutations in IDH1/2 confer a gain-of-function in cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation and secretion in vast excess of an oncometabolite, the D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Overproduction of D-2HG interferes with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, contributing to oncogenesis. Indeed, high levels of D-2HG inhibit alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including histone and DNA demethylases, leading to histone and DNA hypermethylation and finally a block in cell differentiation. Furthermore, D-2HG is a biomarker suitable for the detection of IDH1/2 mutations at diagnosis and predictive of the clinical response. Finally, mutant-IDH1/2 enzymes inhibitors have entered clinical trials for patients with IDH1/2 mutations and represent a novel drug class for targeted therapy.","['Mondesir, Johanna', 'Willekens, Christophe', 'Touat, Mehdi', 'de Botton, Stephane']","['Mondesir J', 'Willekens C', 'Touat M', 'de Botton S']","[""Service d'Immunopathologie Clinique, Hopital Saint Louis; CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris."", ""Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Service d'Hematologie Clinique; INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif; Faculte de medecine Paris-Sud, Kremlin-Bicetre."", ""AP-HP, Hopitaux Universitaires La Pitie Salpetriere - Charles Foix, Service de Neurologie 2-Mazarin, Paris; Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Departement d'Innovation Therapeutique et d'Essais Precoces, Villejuif, France."", ""Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Service d'Hematologie Clinique; INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif; Faculte de medecine Paris-Sud, Kremlin-Bicetre.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160902,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,PMC5015873,,2016/09/14 06:00,2016/09/14 06:01,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S70716 [doi]', 'jbm-7-171 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2016 Sep 2;7:171-80. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S70716. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-HG', 'IDH1', 'IDH2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic', 'glioma', 'oncogene', 'targeted therapies', 'tumor metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We incubated human dermal fibroblast cultures for 48 hours with high and low concentrations of CSE extracts and analyzed changes in gene expression. Cells treated with CSE extract showed concentration-dependent upregulation of collagen type I genes and of multiple antioxidative genes, including OXR1, TXNRD1, and PRDX family genes. We further conducted in silico phylogenetic footprinting analysis of promoter regions. These results suggested that transcription factors such as acute myeloid leukemia-1a and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein may be involved in the observed upregulation of antioxidative genes. Our results support the idea that CSEs are strong candidate sources of antioxidant materials and cosmeceutically effective ingredients.","['Yoshino, Atsushi', 'Polouliakh, Natalia', 'Meguro, Akira', 'Takeuchi, Masaki', 'Kawagoe, Tatsukata', 'Mizuki, Nobuhisa']","['Yoshino A', 'Polouliakh N', 'Meguro A', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kawagoe T', 'Mizuki N']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa; Sony Computer Science Laboratories Inc., Fundamental Research Laboratories; Systems Biology Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa; Inflammatory Disease Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,New Zealand,Clin Interv Aging,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/*metabolism', '*Eggs', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Oncorhynchus keta', 'Tissue Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5010078,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/CIA.S102092 [doi]', 'cia-11-1159 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Interv Aging. 2016 Aug 29;11:1159-68. doi: 10.2147/CIA.S102092. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antiaging', 'antioxidative gene', 'fish egg', 'gene expression analysis', 'phylogenetic footprinting analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I study of lenalidomide demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in patients with relapsed ATL. The current phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide monotherapy in patients with relapsed or recurrent ATL. Patients and Methods Patients 20 years of age or older with acute, lymphoma, or unfavorable chronic subtype ATL, who had received one or more prior anti-ATL systemic chemotherapy and achieved stable disease or better on their last anti-ATL therapy with subsequent relapse or recurrence, were eligible. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg/d continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall response rate; secondary end points included safety, tumor control rate (stable disease or better), time to response, duration of response, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results Objective responses were noted in 11 of 26 patients (overall response rate, 42%; 95% CI, 23% to 63%), including four complete responses and one unconfirmed complete response. The tumor control rate was 73%. The median time to response and duration of response were 1.9 months and not estimable, respectively, and the median time to progression was 3.8 months. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.8 and 20.3 months, respectively. The most frequent grade >/= 3 adverse events were neutropenia (65%), leukopenia (38%), lymphopenia (38%), and thrombocytopenia (23%), which were all manageable and reversible. Conclusion Lenalidomide demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed or recurrent aggressive ATL, hinting at its potential to become a treatment option. Further investigations of lenalidomide in ATL and other mature T-cell neoplasms are warranted.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Abe, Yasunobu', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Jo, Tatsuro', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Ito, Shigeki', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Otsuka, Maki', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Midorikawa, Shuichi', 'Ruiz, Wanda', 'Ohtsu, Tomoko']","['Ishida T', 'Fujiwara H', 'Nosaka K', 'Taira N', 'Abe Y', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Jo T', 'Ishizawa K', 'Tobinai K', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Ito S', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Otsuka M', 'Ogura M', 'Midorikawa S', 'Ruiz W', 'Ohtsu T']","['Takashi Ishida, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Aichi;

As a consequence, CML stem cells persist and cause relapse in most patients upon drug discontinuation. Furthermore, no effective therapy exists for the advanced stages of the disease. Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP; IL1R3) is a coreceptor of interleukin-1 receptor type 1 and has been found upregulated on CML stem cells. Here, we show that primitive (CD34(+)CD38(-)) CML cells, in contrast to corresponding normal cells, express a functional interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor complex and respond with NF-kappaB activation and marked proliferation in response to IL-1. IL1RAP antibodies that inhibit IL-1 signaling could block these effects. In vivo administration of IL1RAP antibodies in mice transplanted with chronic and blast phase CML cells resulted in therapeutic effects mediated by murine effector cells. These results provide novel insights into the role of IL1RAP in CML and a strong rationale for the development of an IL1RAP antibody therapy to target residual CML stem cells.","['Agerstam, Helena', 'Hansen, Nils', 'von Palffy, Sofia', 'Sanden, Carl', 'Reckzeh, Kristian', 'Karlsson, Christine', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Landberg, Niklas', 'Askmyr, Maria', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Wadenvik, Hans', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Richter, Johan', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Agerstam H', 'Hansen N', 'von Palffy S', 'Sanden C', 'Reckzeh K', 'Karlsson C', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Landberg N', 'Askmyr M', 'Hogberg C', 'Rissler M', 'Porkka K', 'Wadenvik H', 'Mustjoki S', 'Richter J', 'Jaras M', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; and.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Vascular Disorders, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33928-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-11-679985 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Dec 8;128(23):2683-2693. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-679985.

Patients remain at risk for relapse, and additional approaches to deplete CML LSC are needed to enhance the possibility of discontinuing TKI treatment. We have previously reported that expression of the pivotal proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is increased in CML bone marrow. We show here that CML LSC demonstrated increased expression of the IL-1 receptors, IL-1 receptor accessory protein and IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), and enhanced sensitivity to IL-1-induced NF-kappaB signaling compared with normal stem cells. Treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) inhibited IL-1 signaling in CML LSC and inhibited growth of CML LSC. Importantly, the combination of IL-1RA with TKI resulted in significantly greater inhibition of CML LSC compared with TKI alone. Our studies also suggest that IL-1 signaling contributes to overexpression of inflammatory mediators in CML LSC, suggesting that blocking IL-1 signaling could modulate the inflammatory milieu. We conclude that IL-1 signaling contributes to maintenance of CML LSC following TKI treatment and that IL-1 blockade with IL-1RA enhances elimination of TKI-treated CML LSC. These results provide a strong rationale for further exploration of anti-IL-1 strategies to enhance LSC elimination in CML.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Chu, Su', 'Agarwal, Puneet', 'Campbell, Victoria L', 'Hopcroft, Lisa', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Lin, Allen', 'Gaal, Karl', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Zhang B', 'Chu S', 'Agarwal P', 'Campbell VL', 'Hopcroft L', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Lin A', 'Gaal K', 'Holyoake TL', 'Bhatia R']","['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'College of Medical, Veterinary, & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'College of Medical, Veterinary, & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'College of Medical, Veterinary, & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'College of Medical, Veterinary, & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type I/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC5146743,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33927-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-11-679928 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Dec 8;128(23):2671-2682. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-679928.

So far, the functions of Zfp462 remain unclear. In our study, we showed that Zfp462 is expressed predominantly in the developing brain, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus regions from embryonic day 7.5 to early postnatal stage. By using a piggyBac transposon-generated Zfp462 knockout (KO) mouse model, we found that Zfp462 KO mice exhibited prenatal lethality with normal neural tube patterning, whereas heterozygous (Het) Zfp462 KO (Zfp462(+/-) ) mice showed developmental delay with low body weight and brain weight. Behavioral studies showed that Zfp462(+/-) mice presented anxiety-like behaviors with excessive self-grooming and hair loss, which were similar to the pathological grooming behaviors in Hoxb8 KO mice. Further analysis of grooming microstructure showed the impairment of grooming patterning in Zfp462(+/-) mice. In addition, the mRNA levels of Pbx1 (pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1, an interacting protein of Zfp462) and Hoxb8 decreased in the brains of Zfp462(+/-) mice, which may be the cause of anxiety-like behaviors. Finally, imipramine, a widely used and effective anti-anxiety medicine, rescued anxiety-like behaviors and excessive self-grooming in Zfp462(+/-) mice. In conclusion, Zfp462 deficiency causes anxiety-like behaviors with excessive self-grooming in mice. This provides a novel genetic mouse model for anxiety disorders and a useful tool to determine potential therapeutic targets for anxiety disorders and screen anti-anxiety drugs.","['Wang, B', 'Zheng, Y', 'Shi, H', 'Du, X', 'Zhang, Y', 'Wei, B', 'Luo, M', 'Wang, H', 'Wu, X', 'Hua, X', 'Sun, M', 'Xu, X']","['Wang B', 'Zheng Y', 'Shi H', 'Du X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei B', 'Luo M', 'Wang H', 'Wu X', 'Hua X', 'Sun M', 'Xu X']","['Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute for Fetology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital Research Center, Institute of Reproduction and Development, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Developmental Biology & Molecular Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics & Development, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou City, China.', 'Institute for Fetology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute for Fetology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital Research Center, Institute of Reproduction and Development, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Developmental Biology & Molecular Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics & Development, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Developmental Biology & Molecular Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, MOE Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics & Development, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Emergency, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Institute for Fetology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161007,England,Genes Brain Behav,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,IM,"['Animals', 'Anxiety/*metabolism', 'Behavior, Animal/physiology', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cerebral Cortex/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Grooming/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/06/29 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/gbb.12339 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Brain Behav. 2017 Feb;16(2):296-307. doi: 10.1111/gbb.12339.

In Brazil, the mortality from myeloid leukemia is 1.74/100 000 men and 1.37/100 000 women. Our aim was to review and update guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation on indications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for the treatment AML. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Allo-HSCT is recommended for high-risk AML (IA); (ii) allo-HSCT is recommended for AML of intermediate risk (IA); (iii) allo-HSCT is recommended for AML relapsed/refractory (C4); (iv) auto-HSCT is recommended for AML after 1 consolidation (C4); (v) auto-HSCT is recommended for AML in CR1 (higher than QT in the Brazilian experience) (C4); (vi) auto-HSCT is accepted for AML M3 in second molecular complete remission (2B); (vii) peripheral blood instead of Bone Marrow HSC for advanced disease (2A); (viii) recommended conditioning protocols: Bu-Cy/Bu-Mel, Bu-Flu, TBI-Cy. In umbilical cord HSCT, consider ATG-based protocols (2A); (ix) allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of AML can be used in patients between 60 and 80 yr with good performance status and the absence of significant comorbidities (C4).","['Silla, Lucia', 'Dulley, Frederico', 'Saboya, Rosaura', 'Kerbauy, Fabio', 'de Moraes Arantes, Adriano', 'Pezzi, Annelise', 'Gross, Luisa Grave', 'Paton, Eduardo', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson']","['Silla L', 'Dulley F', 'Saboya R', 'Kerbauy F', 'de Moraes Arantes A', 'Pezzi A', 'Gross LG', 'Paton E', 'Hamerschlak N']","['Cellular Therapy Program HCPA, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Ingles, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Ingles, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Albert Einstein e UNIFESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Araujo Jorge, Goiania, Brazil.', 'Cellular Therapy Program HCPA, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital de Cancer de Barretos, Barretos, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Albert Einstein e UNIFESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",20161011,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Brazil', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12808 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Feb;98(2):177-183. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12808.

Despite its prevalence, the exact genomic targets of E/R have remained elusive. We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by E/R genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). We show that expression of the E/R fusion leads to widespread repression of RUNX1 motif-containing enhancers at its target gene loci. Moreover, multiple super-enhancers from the CD19(+)/CD20(+)-lineage were repressed, implicating a role in impediment of lineage commitment. In effect, the expression of several genes involved in B cell signaling and adhesion was down-regulated, and the repression depended on the wild-type DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1. We also identified a number of E/R-regulated annotated and de novo noncoding genes. The results provide a comprehensive genome-wide mapping between E/R-regulated key regulatory elements and genes in precursor B cell leukemia that disrupt normal B lymphopoiesis.","['Teppo, Susanna', 'Laukkanen, Saara', 'Liuksiala, Thomas', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Oittinen, Mikko', 'Teittinen, Kaisa', 'Gronroos, Toni', 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine', 'Nykter, Matti', 'Viiri, Keijo', 'Heinaniemi, Merja', 'Lohi, Olli']","['Teppo S', 'Laukkanen S', 'Liuksiala T', 'Nordlund J', 'Oittinen M', 'Teittinen K', 'Gronroos T', 'St-Onge P', 'Sinnett D', 'Syvanen AC', 'Nykter M', 'Viiri K', 'Heinaniemi M', 'Lohi O']","['Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology, University of Tampere, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 75105, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 75105, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology, University of Tampere, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, 33720 Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, 70211 Kuopio, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, 33520 Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160912,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Loci', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5088590,,2016/11/03 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2015/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.193649.115 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.193649.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2016 Nov;26(11):1468-1477. doi: 10.1101/gr.193649.115.

The aim of this study was to identify the potential benefits of decitabine as a prior therapy before salvaged unrelated UCBT for refractory or relapsed childhood AL. Eight consecutive patients with childhood refractory/relapsed AL were enrolled in our study between 2013 and 2014. All patients were in NR status before the time of transplant and had features associated with poor outcomes, such as CNSL, MDS-AML, high WBC count at diagnosis, and hypodiploid status (FLT3+/ITD+). Additionally, all patients had one of the following disease statuses: PIF, multiple relapse, or early relapse. All transplants were performed with decitabine as part of the myeloablative conditioning regimen, which was decitabine+Flu/Bu/CY+/-BCNU or decitabine+Ara-c/BU/CY2+/-BCNU. A total of seven patients (7 of 8) achieved neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment, and one patient experienced primary graft failure. All eight patients (100%) developed PES at a median of 7 days. Three patients developed stage II-IV acute GVHD at a median of 18 days. Additionally, three patients developed chronic GVHD, but it was not extensive in any of those three patients. The median follow-up time after CBT was 19.9 months (range, 9.2-30.7 months). The estimated probability of OS was 75%. Two patients (2 of 8) experienced a testis relapse, and two patients (2 of 8) died. Our experience suggests that the additional application of decitabine as part of the myeloablative conditioning regimen prior to UCBT for refractory or relapsed childhood AL among patients who are not in remission is safe and might be an effective treatment option.","['Zhou, Haixia', 'Zheng, Changcheng', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Tong, Juan', 'Zhang, Xuhan', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zhou H', 'Zheng C', 'Zhu X', 'Tang B', 'Tong J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang L', 'Liu H', 'Sun Z']","['Shandong University School of Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Shandong University School of Medicine, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160912,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.12805 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2016 Dec;20(8):1117-1124. doi: 10.1111/petr.12805.

Virus clearance evaluation studies were conducted utilising a scaled-down version of the manufacturing process. Total virus clearance was evaluated using the ecotropic murine leukaemia virus (eMuLV) as a model for non-infectious retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs) and certain enveloped viruses. Other viruses utilised included: infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBRV), minute virus of mice (MVM), bovine enterovirus (BEV) and Reo-3 virus (Reo-3). Robust clearance of all model viruses was demonstrated with either new or reused resins. Overall, virus reduction factors were: >18.0 log10 (eMuLV); 11.0 log10 (MVM); >11.8 log10 (Reo-3; >5.0 log10 using nanofiltration); >15.3 log10 (BEV) and >12.7 log10 (IBRV).

A subset of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibits increased copy number of chromosome 9p24, on which CD274 resides; however, most SCLCs show low expression of PD-L1. We therefore examined whether CD274 is a target of recurrent genomic alterations.Experimental Design: We examined somatic copy number alterations in two patient cohorts by quantitative real-time PCR in 72 human SCLC cases (cohort 1) and SNP array analysis in 138 human SCLC cases (cohort 2). Whole-genome sequencing revealed the detailed genomic structure underlying focal amplification. PD-L1 expression in amplified cases from cohorts 1 and 2 was further examined by transcriptome sequencing and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.Results: By examining somatic copy number alterations in two cohorts of primary human SCLC specimens, we observed 9p24 copy number gains (where CD274 resides) and focal, high-level amplification of CD274 We found evidence for genomic targeting of CD274, suggesting selection during oncogenic transformation. CD274 amplification was caused by genomic rearrangements not affecting the open reading frame, thus leading to massively increased CD274 transcripts and high level expression of PD-L1.Conclusions: A subset (4/210, 1.9%) of human SCLC patient cases exhibits massive expression of PD-L1 caused by focal amplification of CD274 Such tumors may be particularly susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.

We sought to determine if the clinical characteristics, morbidity and seasonality of infection differed according to the type of enteric virus identified. METHODS: Cases of NV, RV and AV were identified in stool specimens submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory between November 2005 and February 2015. Clinical characteristics of patients, potential risk factors and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 97 VAD cases were identified: NV (n = 49), RV (n = 34) and AV (n = 14). The majority of cases were in patients with leukemia and lymphoma. NV (59%), RV (74%) and AV (78%) were identified in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; and in patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD): NV (34%), RV (46%) and AV (57%). Nine cases of NV were genotyped; all were due to genotype II. Nine of 49 (18%) cases of NV, 7 of 34 (20%) cases of RV and 2 of 14 (14%) cases of AV were considered to be health care acquired (HCA). In multivariate analysis, immunosuppression (OR 2.8 95% CI 1.26-6.60, p = .01) and neutropenia (OR 4.8 95% CI 1.27-18.5, p = .01) were identified as risk factors for NV diarrhea compared to RV and AV. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, agents responsible for VAD occurred year round but predominated in the winter time; caused prolonged illness and were frequently health care associated. Presentations were atypical in many cases without upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.","['Ghosh, Natasha', 'Malik, Farida A', 'Daver, Roshni G', 'Vanichanan, Jakapat', 'Okhuysen, Pablo C']","['Ghosh N', 'Malik FA', 'Daver RG', 'Vanichanan J', 'Okhuysen PC']","['a Department of Infectious Diseases , Infection Control and Employee Health University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b University of Texas School of Public Health , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Infectious Diseases , Infection Control and Employee Health University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c McGovern Medical School , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Infectious Diseases , Infection Control and Employee Health University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c McGovern Medical School , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Infectious Diseases , Infection Control and Employee Health University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c McGovern Medical School , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Infectious Diseases , Infection Control and Employee Health University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b University of Texas School of Public Health , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c McGovern Medical School , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160913,England,Infect Dis (Lond),"Infectious diseases (London, England)",101650235,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diarrhea/*epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Feces/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Norovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rotavirus/*isolation & purification', 'Seasons', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/*epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/23744235.2016.1224384 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Dis (Lond). 2017 Feb;49(2):113-119. doi: 10.1080/23744235.2016.1224384.

Familial cancers are often caused by genetic alterations occurring either in tumor suppressor or genomic stability genes such as TP53. In this study, we have analyzed the TP53 gene by direct sequencing approach, in a panel of 18 Tunisian familial hematological malignancies cases including several forms of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloid syndrome and 22 cases of sporadic acute leukemia. In one familial case diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we reported an intronic substitution 559+1 G>A which may disrupt the splice site and impact the normal protein function. Most of the deleterious mutations (Arg158His; Pro282Trp; Thr312Ser) as classified by IARC data base, were commonly reported in ALL cases studied here. The cosegregation of the two variants rs1042522 and rs1642785 was observed in most patients which may be in favor of the presence of linkage disequilibrium. The most defined TP53 mutations found here were identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia context whereas only 3 % of mutations have been in previous studies. The cosegregation of the two recurrent variant rs1042522 and rs1642785 should be further confirmed.","['Hamadou, Walid Sabri', 'Besbes, Sawsen', 'Bourdon, Violaine', 'Youssef, Yosra Ben', 'Laatiri, Mohamed Adnene', 'Noguchi, Testsuro', 'Khelif, Abderrahim', 'Sobol, Hagay', 'Soua, Zohra']","['Hamadou WS', 'Besbes S', 'Bourdon V', 'Youssef YB', 'Laatiri MA', 'Noguchi T', 'Khelif A', 'Sobol H', 'Soua Z']","['RU ""Molecular Biology of Leukemias and Lymphomas"", Laboratory of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine of Sousse, University of Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia. walid_sabrimail@yahoo.fr.', 'RU ""Molecular Biology of Leukemias and Lymphomas"", Laboratory of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine of Sousse, University of Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Genetic Oncology, Prevention and Screening, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Service of Clinical Hematology, CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Service of Clinical Hematology, CHU Fattouma Bourguiba, Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Department of Genetic Oncology, Prevention and Screening, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Service of Clinical Hematology, CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Genetic Oncology, Prevention and Screening, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'RU ""Molecular Biology of Leukemias and Lymphomas"", Laboratory of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine of Sousse, University of Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Tunisia']",,,2016/09/14 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/09/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10689-016-9931-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10689-016-9931-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2017 Jan;16(1):153-157. doi: 10.1007/s10689-016-9931-3.,,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Familial hematological malignancies', '*TP53 gene mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: miR-503 expression is downregulated in ECSCs by DNA hypermethylation and this contributes to their proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, extracellular matrix (ECM) contractility and angiogenesis through effects on cyclin D1, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl)-2, Ras homology A and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A variety of miRNAs are demonstrated to involve in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. miR-503 is a miRNA with tumor-suppressor functions, whose expression is suppressed in ECSCs. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We isolated ECSCs and normal endometrial stromal cells (NESCs) from ovarian endometriotic tissues (n = 32) and eutopic endometrial tissues without endometriosis (n = 8), respectively. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We investigated the functions of miR-503 by using miR-503-transfected ECSCs and the DNA methylation status of miR-503 gene in ECSCs and NESCs by combined bisulfite restriction analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In ECSCs, miR-503 is downregulated by the DNA hypermethylation of its gene. The transfection of miR-503 into ECSCs resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through the suppression of cyclin D1, the induction of apoptosis through Bcl-2 suppression, the inhibition of VEGF-A production and the attenuation of ECM contractility via the suppression of Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase-pathways. LARGE SCALE DATA: NA. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The present experiments were carried out only with the stromal component of endometriosis and eutopic endometrium. The experiments with the eutopic endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis are not performed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings indicate that epigenetically repressed miR-503 in ECSCs is involved in the acquisition of endometriosis-specific cellular functions.

Using mouse bone marrow cells transformed by MLL-fusion genes expressing graduated levels of Meis1, we show a positive correlation between miR-155 and Meis1. However, using a miR-155-knockout mouse model, we show that the absence and the depletion of miR-155 have no effect on leukemia formation or progression. We also show for the first time that miR-155 levels are correlated with MLL translocations, but that miR-155 expression is dispensable for the formation of AML and has no effect on leukemia progression.","['Schneider, Edith', 'Staffas, Anna', 'Rohner, Linda', 'Krowiorz, Kathrin', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Rouhi, Arefeh', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Palmqvist, Lars']","['Schneider E', 'Staffas A', 'Rohner L', 'Krowiorz K', 'Heuser M', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner H', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Rouhi A', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Palmqvist L']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic makeup of diseases, especially cancers. The identification of somatic mutations that can drive cancer has led to the development of therapies that specifically target the abnormal proteins derived from these mutations. This has led to a paradigm shift in our treatment methodology. Although some success has been achieved in targeting some genetic abnormalities, several challenges and limitations exist when applying precision-medicine concepts in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.

The commitment of infected neurons toward the viral lytic or latent transcriptional program is likely to depend on both viral and cellular factors, and to differ among individual neurons. In this study, we used a mouse model of HSV-1 infection to investigate the relationship between viral genomes and the nuclear environment in terms of the establishment of latency. During acute infection, viral genomes show two major patterns: replication compartments or multiple spots distributed in the nucleoplasm (namely ""multiple-acute""). Viral genomes in the ""multiple-acute"" pattern are systematically associated with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in structures designated viral DNA-containing PML nuclear bodies (vDCP-NBs). To investigate the viral and cellular features that favor the acquisition of the latency-associated viral genome patterns, we infected mouse primary TG neurons from wild type (wt) mice or knock-out mice for type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor with wt or a mutant HSV-1, which is unable to replicate due to the synthesis of a non-functional ICP4, the major virus transactivator. We found that the inability of the virus to initiate the lytic program combined to its inability to synthesize a functional ICP0, are the two viral features leading to the formation of vDCP-NBs. The formation of the ""multiple-latency"" pattern is favored by the type 1 IFN signaling pathway in the context of neurons infected by a virus able to replicate through the expression of a functional ICP4 but unable to express functional VP16 and ICP0. Analyses of TGs harvested from HSV-1 latently infected humans showed that viral genomes and PML occupy similar nuclear areas in infected neurons, eventually forming vDCP-NB-like structures. Overall our study designates PML protein and PML-NBs to be major cellular components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency, probably during the entire life of an individual.","['Maroui, Mohamed Ali', 'Calle, Aleth', 'Cohen, Camille', 'Streichenberger, Nathalie', 'Texier, Pascale', 'Takissian, Julie', 'Rousseau, Antoine', 'Poccardi, Nolwenn', 'Welsch, Jeremy', 'Corpet, Armelle', 'Schaeffer, Laurent', 'Labetoulle, Marc', 'Lomonte, Patrick']","['Maroui MA', 'Calle A', 'Cohen C', 'Streichenberger N', 'Texier P', 'Takissian J', 'Rousseau A', 'Poccardi N', 'Welsch J', 'Corpet A', 'Schaeffer L', 'Labetoulle M', 'Lomonte P']","['Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Nerve-Muscle Interactions, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lyon, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Centre de Pathologie et Neuropathologie Est, Bron, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule (I2BC), Departement de Virologie, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule (I2BC), Departement de Virologie, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', ""Universite Paris Sud, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bicetre, Service d'Ophthalmologie, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule (I2BC), Departement de Virologie, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, CNRS UMR 5308, INSERM U 1111, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), team Immunobiologie des infections virales, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Nerve-Muscle Interactions, Lyon, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule (I2BC), Departement de Virologie, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', ""Universite Paris Sud, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bicetre, Service d'Ophthalmologie, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5310, INSERM U 1217, LabEx DEVweCAN, Institut NeuroMyoGene (INMG), team Chromatin Assembly, Nuclear Domains, Virus, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160912,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Herpes Simplex/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/virology', 'Virus Latency/*genetics']",PMC5019400,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/13 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005834 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-16-00814 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2016 Sep 12;12(9):e1005834. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005834. eCollection 2016 Sep.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,['Microb Cell. 2016 Nov 04;3(11):569-572.

Consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) has an increasing role in the management of ATL in eligible patients, offering favourable long-term remission rates. However, relatively high-transplant-related mortality and issues with donor recruitment for certain ethnicities remain problematic.

Data from 102 allo-SCT patients with a diagnosis of T-ALL from three centers were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were grouped into four T-ALL subtypes: ETP, early, cortical and mature. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), PFS, non-relapse mortality and cumulative incidence (CI) progression were 35, 33, 11 and 55%, respectively. Patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) had a 3-year OS of 62% versus those transplanted in CR2 or greater (24%) (hazards ratio 1.6, P=0.2). Patients with MRD positivity at the time of transplant had significantly higher rates of progression compared with those with MRD negativity (76 vs 34%, hazards ratio 2.8, P=0.006). There was no difference in OS, PFS or cumulative incidence (CI) progression between disease subtypes, including ETP (n=16). ETP patients transplanted in CR1 (n=10) had OS of 47%, comparable to other disease subtypes, suggesting that allo-SCT can overcome the poor prognosis associated with ETP. MRD status at transplant was highly predictive of disease relapse, suggesting novel therapies are necessary to improve transplant outcomes.","['Brammer, J E', 'Saliba, R M', 'Jorgensen, J L', 'Ledesma, C', 'Gaballa, S', 'Poon, M', 'Maziarz, R T', 'Champlin, R E', 'Hosing, C', 'Kebriaei, P']","['Brammer JE', 'Saliba RM', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Ledesma C', 'Gaballa S', 'Poon M', 'Maziarz RT', 'Champlin RE', 'Hosing C', 'Kebriaei P']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'National University Health System Singapore, Singapore.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160912,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016194 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Jan;52(1):20-27. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.194.

There are no data regarding pregnancy screening patterns for adolescents before chemotherapy exposure. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of leukemia and emergency room (ER) admissions in the Pediatric Health Information System from 1999 to 2011 was conducted. Females who were 10 to 18 years old and 1) had newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or 2) had ER visits with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis were included. The exposure was a hospital visit with either chemotherapy or an abdominal/pelvic CT scan. The main outcome was a pregnancy test billed on the same day or before the teratogenic exposure within the same index admission. Log-binomial regressions were used to compute prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing pregnancy screening in the leukemia and ER cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 35,650 admissions were identified. The proportion of visits with an appropriately timed pregnancy test was 35%, 64%, and 58% in the ALL (n = 889), AML (n = 127), and ER cohorts (n = 34,634), respectively. Patients with ALL were significantly less likely to have a pregnancy test than the ER cohort (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.78), but there was no significant difference between the AML and ER cohorts (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.27). There was substantial hospital-level variation in pregnancy screening patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with acute leukemia and ER visits have low rates of pregnancy screening before teratogenic exposures. Standardized practice guidelines for pregnancy screening among adolescents may improve screening rates. Cancer 2016;122:3394-3400.

Precursor lymphoid neoplasm incidence rates increased from 2001 to 2012, particularly for B-cell neoplasms. Among the mature lymphoid neoplasms, the fastest increase was for plasma cell neoplasms. Rates also increased for mantle cell lymphoma (males), marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mycosis fungoides. Like incidence, survival for both mature T-cell lymphomas and mature B-cell lymphomas varied by subtype and by race. Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas had among the worst 5-year relative survival (36%-56%, depending on race/sex), while those with mycosis fungoides had among the best survival (79%-92%). For B-cell lymphomas, 5-year survival ranged from 83% to 91% for patients with marginal zone lymphoma and from 78% to 92% for those with hairy cell leukemia; but the rates were as low as 47% to 63% for patients with Burkitt lymphoma and 44% to 48% for those with plasma cell neoplasms. In general, black men had the lowest survival across lymphoid malignancy subtypes. These contemporary incidence and survival statistics are useful for developing management strategies for these cancers and can offer clues regarding their etiology. CA Cancer J Clin 2016;66:443-459.

Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of A. nilagirica extracts/fractions on inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis in a human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell line. The crude extracts (A. nilagirica ethyl acetate extract [ANE] and A. nilagirica methanolic extract [ANA]) showed cytotoxic activity toward THP-1 cells with the IC50 values of 38.21 +/- 7.37 and 132.41 +/- 7.19 microg/ml, respectively. However, the cytotoxic activity of active fractions (ANE-B and ANM-9) obtained after column chromatography was found to be much more pronounced than their parent extracts. The IC50 values of ANE-B and ANM-9 were found to be 27.04 +/- 2.54 microg/ml and 12.70 +/- 4.79 microg/ml, respectively, suggesting greater susceptibility of the malignant cells. Cell cycle analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed that inhibition of cell growth by A. nilagirica fractions on THP-1 cells was mediated by apoptosis. Active fractions of A. nilagirica increased the expression levels of caspase-3, -7, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), a critical member of the apoptotic pathway. These results suggested that active fractions of A. nilagirica may play a promising role in growth suppression by inducing apoptosis in human monocytic leukemic cells via mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways.","['Gul, Mir Zahoor', 'Chandrasekaran, Sambamurthy', 'K, Manjulatha', 'Bhat, Mohd Yasin', 'Maurya, Radheshyam', 'Qureshi, Insaf Ahmed', 'Ghazi, Irfan Ahmad']","['Gul MZ', 'Chandrasekaran S', 'K M', 'Bhat MY', 'Maurya R', 'Qureshi IA', 'Ghazi IA']","['a Department of Plant Sciences , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'b Department of Animal Biology , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'c Department of Biochemistry , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'a Department of Plant Sciences , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'b Department of Animal Biology , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'd Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics , School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.', 'a Department of Plant Sciences , University of Hyderabad , Gachibowli, Hyderabad , Telangana , India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160811,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/chemistry/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Artemisia/*chemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Caspase 3/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'India', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/adverse effects/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2016.1205900 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2016 Oct;68(7):1210-24. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2016.1205900.

Once the details of the T315I mutation were acquired, we initiated ponatinib treatment at a standard dosage and observed a rapid decrease of minimal residual disease (MRD) at molecular assessment. The bone marrow evaluation after 2, 3, 6, 10 and 13 months was negative for MRD. After starting ponatinib, the patient experienced a skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas no occurrence of GVHD was observed after transplant, suggesting that the efficacy of ponatinib could be related not only to the direct antileukemic effect, but also to its ability to promote an indirect graft-versus-leukemia effect.

However, its role in normal hematopoiesis and leukaemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we detected its increased expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60, THP1 cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and confirmed that PU.1, a key transcriptional factor for monocyte/macrophage differentiation, is responsible for transcriptional activation of miR-22 during the differentiation. By gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-22 promoted monocyte/macrophage differentiation, and MECOM (EVI1) mRNA is a direct target of miR-22 and MECOM (EVI1) functions as a negative regulator in the differentiation. The miR-22-mediated MECOM degradation increased c-Jun but decreased GATA2 expression, which results in increased interaction between c-Jun and PU.1 via increasing c-Jun levels and relief of MECOM- and GATA2-mediated interference in the interaction, and thus promoting monocyte/macrophage differentiation. We also observed significantly down-regulation of PU.1 and miR-22 as well as significantly up-regulation of MECOM in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Reintroduction of miR-22 relieved the differentiation blockage and inhibited the growth of bone marrow blasts of AML patients.

Hoxa9 and Meis1 also cooperate to induce aggressive AML with high Flt3 expression in mice, suggesting an important role for Flt3 in Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemogenesis. To define the role of Flt3 in AML with high Hoxa9/Meis1, we treated mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML with the Flt3 inhibitor AC220, used an Flt3-ligand (FL-/-) knockout model, and investigated whether overexpression of Flt3 could induce leukemia together with overexpression of Hoxa9. Flt3 inhibition by AC220 did not delay AML development in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells overexpressing Hoxa9 and Meis1. In addition, Hoxa9/Meis1 cells induced AML in FL-/- mice as rapid as in wild-type mice. However, FL-/- mice had reduced organ infiltration compared with wild-type mice, suggesting some Flt3-dependent effect on leukemic invasiveness. Interestingly, leukemic Hoxa9/Meis1 cells from sick mice expressed high levels of Flt3 regardless of presence of its ligand, showing that Flt3 is a passive marker on these cells. In line with this, combined engineered overexpression of Flt3 and Hoxa9 did not accelerate the progression to AML. We conclude that the Hoxa9- and Meis1-associated upregulation of Flt3 is not a requirement for leukemic progression induced by Hoxa9 and Meis1.","['Staffas, A', 'Arabanian, L S', 'Wei, S Y', 'Jansson, A', 'Stahlman, S', 'Johansson, P', 'Fogelstrand, L', 'Cammenga, J', 'Kuchenbauer, F', 'Palmqvist, L']","['Staffas A', 'Arabanian LS', 'Wei SY', 'Jansson A', 'Stahlman S', 'Johansson P', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Cammenga J', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Palmqvist L']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160912,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016318 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.318 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Mar;36(11):1516-1524. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.318.

Herein, we present the case of an 85-year-old woman with a 3-year history of stable asymptomatic CLL that developed a cutaneous RS. The patient presented with painless inflammation in the left leg and foot that was initially diagnosed as a cellulitis infection. She was treated accordingly with ceftriaxone and clindamycin. However, after completing the antibiotic regimen, not only did the inflammation persist, but also superimposed painless nodules gradually appeared on the left leg and foot over the course of four months. The histopathological examination of the nodules revealed a large B-cell cutaneous lymphoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy with CVP, followed by R-CHOP, resulting in a reduction of size of the nodules and remission of the inflammation. The patient died five months after the diagnosis owing to a bacterial pneumonia. We identified in previous reports a total of fifteen cases of cutaneous RS. Most cases presented with rapidly growing tumors or multiple erythematous nodules, similar to our case. This case of a cutaneous RS mimicking a cellulitis infection underlines the importance of a low threshold for performing biopsies of suspicious skin lesions in patients with CLL/SLL.","['Cesar, Artur', 'Calistru, Ana', 'Pardal, Joana', 'Magina, Sofia', 'Mota, Alberto', 'Azevedo, Filomena']","['Cesar A', 'Calistru A', 'Pardal J', 'Magina S', 'Mota A', 'Azevedo F']","['Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Centro Hospitalar Sao Joao EPE, Porto, Portugal; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal. arturjfc@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160515,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cellulitis/diagnosis', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leg', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Syndrome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/04/26 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2016 May 15;22(5).,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic interventions to restore terminal differentiation (""differentiation therapy"") are a very attractive way to treat cancer, especially leukemia. A variety of chemicals stimulates differentiation of leukemic cells, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Tumor suppressor genes have a vital role in the gateway to terminal cell differentiation. In this study, we inhibited PTEN tumor suppressor gene expression by siRNA to investigate the effect of potentiating cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis on HL-60 cell differentiation by DMSO and ATRA. Our results show that PTEN siRNA increases HL-60 cell differentiation in the presence of DMSO and ATRA. At the same time, the presence of siRNA hampers accumulation of apoptotic cells during incubation.

However, EMR is an important cause of treatment failure among patients with acute leukemia. Therefore, early detection of these relapses may improve the prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To describe the disease-related demographic and clinical features and radiologic findings for children diagnosed with EMR in acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was based on 22 children (M: F = 14: 8; mean age 7.30 (2.1 - 15.7) years) with 8 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 14 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) who had experienced an EMR. Age, gender, clinical symptoms, initial extramedullary disease (EMD), French-American-British (FAB) morphology, cytogenetics, time to and site of EMR, concurrent bone marrow relapse (BMR), radiologic findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: No definite relationship was found between initial EMD and EMR. A predilection for AML to relapse in the central nervous system (CNS), except for the CSF and bone, and for ALL to relapse in the CSF and kidney seemed to occur. Patients with EMR had a significantly higher incidence of t(8: 21) cytogenetics and FAB M2 and L1 morphologies. EMR accompanied with concurrent BMR occurred in 31.8% of the patients, who exhibited a relatively grave clinical course. Radiologic findings were nonspecific and had a great variety of structure involved, including bulging enhancing mass in the CT scan, hypoechoic mass in the US, and enhanced mass-like lesion in the MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the potential sites of EMR, their risk factors, and their clinical and radiologic features may be helpful in the early diagnosis of relapse and planning for therapy.","['Kim, Jee Young', 'Im, Soo Ah', 'Lee, Ju Hyun', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nak Gyun', 'Cho, Bin']","['Kim JY', 'Im SA', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B']","[""Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160528,Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,PMC4992152,,2016/09/13 06:00,2016/09/13 06:01,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2015/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/ijp.1711 [doi]'],epublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2016 May 28;26(3):e1711. doi: 10.5812/ijp.1711. eCollection 2016 Jun.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Extramedullary Leukemia', '*Leukemia', '*Pediatrics', '*Relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The metabolic nature of cancer enables patient cancer status to be monitored by metabolomics and lipidomics. Additionally, monitoring metabolic status of patients or biological models can be used to greater understand the action of anticancer therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: Discuss how metabolomics and lipidomics can be used to (i) identify metabolic biomarkers of cancer and (ii) understand the mechanism-of-action of anticancer therapies. Discuss considerations that can maximize the clinical value of metabolic cancer biomarkers including case-control, prognostic and longitudinal study designs. METHODS: A literature search of the current relevant primary research was performed. RESULTS: Metabolomics and lipidomics can identify metabolic signatures that associate with cancer diagnosis, prognosis and disease progression. Discriminatory metabolites were most commonly linked to lipid or energy metabolism. Case-control studies outnumbered prognostic and longitudinal approaches. Prognostic studies were able to correlate metabolic features with future cancer risk, whereas longitudinal studies were most effective for studying cancer progression. Metabolomics and lipidomics can help to understand the mechanism-of-action of anticancer therapeutics and mechanisms of drug resistance.

PROCEDURE: To understand the epidemiology and risk factors associated with the development of CLABSI in children with AML. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with AML over a 5-year period between 2007 and 2011 at the Children's Hospital Colorado. Cases and controls were classified on the basis of the presence of a CLABSI as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network. RESULTS: Of 40 patients in the study, 25 (62.5%) developed at least one CLABSI during therapy. The majority of CLABSIs were due to oral or gastrointestinal organisms (83.0%). Skin organisms accounted for 8.5%. In a multivariable analysis, the strongest risk factors associated with CLABSI were diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] 6.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-28.7), receipt of blood products in the preceding 4-7 days (OR 10.0, 95%CI 3.2-31.0), not receiving antibiotics (OR 8.3, 95%CI 2.8-25.0), and chemotherapy cycle (OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.4-8.9). CLABSIs led to increased morbidity, with 13 cases (32.5%) versus two controls (1.9%) requiring transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (P < 0.001). Three (7.5%) of 40 CLABSI events resulted in or contributed to death. CONCLUSIONS: Intensified line care efforts cannot eliminate all CLABSIs in the patients with AML. Exploring the role of mucosal barrier breakdown and/or the use of antibiotic prophylaxis may be effective strategies for further prevention of CLABSIs, supporting ongoing trials in this patient population.","['Rogers, Ashley E J', 'Eisenman, Kristen M', 'Dolan, Susan A', 'Belderson, Kristin M', 'Zauche, Jocelyn R', 'Tong, Suhong', 'Gralla, Jane', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Wang, Michael', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Dominguez, Samuel R']","['Rogers AE', 'Eisenman KM', 'Dolan SA', 'Belderson KM', 'Zauche JR', 'Tong S', 'Gralla J', 'Hilden JM', 'Wang M', 'Maloney KW', 'Dominguez SR']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Epidemiology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Epidemiology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160912,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/*etiology', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Catheter-Related Infections/*etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/*etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/microbiology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26254 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Mar;64(3). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26254.

The large toad Rhinella marina is common in the cleared tropical forests of the Iquitos region and is regarded as poisonous. The venom from two different populations of R. marina was collected in the Departamento de Loreto, Peru. The samples were assessed for antiproliferative effect and composition. Some 29 compounds were identified or tentatively identified from the venom by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. The main free bufadienolide was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main bufadienolide argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 mug/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 mug/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 mug/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 mug/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 mug/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). This is the first report on the composition of R. marina venom from the Peruvian Amazon pointing out the need to include different venom samples to get a better picture from the activity and composition of South American toad defense substances.","['Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo', 'Quispe, Cristina', 'Arana, Gabriel Vargas', 'Theoduloz, Cristina', 'Urra, Felix A', 'Cardenas, Cesar']","['Schmeda-Hirschmann G', 'Quispe C', 'Arana GV', 'Theoduloz C', 'Urra FA', 'Cardenas C']","['Laboratorio de Quimica de Productos Naturales, Instituto de Quimica de Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Talca, Casilla 747, 3460000 Talca, Chile.

Overweight or obesity further increases these risks. Steroids are a component of chemotherapy for ALL, and weight gain is a common side effect. To impact behaviors associated with weight gain, we conducted a randomized nutrition counseling intervention in ALL patients on treatment. PROCEDURE: ALL patients on a steroid-based treatment regimen at the MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital were recruited and randomized into control or intervention groups. The control group received standard care and nutrition education materials. The intervention group received monthly one-on-one nutrition counseling sessions, consisting of a baseline and 12 follow-up visits. Anthropometrics, dietary intake (3-day 24-hr dietary recalls) and oxidative stress measures were collected at baseline, 6 months, and postintervention. Dietary recall data were analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (median age 11.5 years), all in the maintenance phase of treatment, were recruited. The intervention group (n = 12) reported significantly lower calorie intake from baseline to 12-month follow-up and significant changes in glutamic acid and selenium intake (P < 0.05). Waist circumference was significantly associated with calorie, vitamin E, glutamic acid, and selenium intake. CONCLUSIONS: A year-long dietary intervention was effective at reducing caloric intake in pediatric ALL patients receiving steroid-based chemotherapy, indicating that this is a modality that can be built upon for obesity prevention and management.","['Li, Rhea', 'Donnella, Hayley', 'Knouse, Phillip', 'Raber, Margaret', 'Crawford, Karla', 'Swartz, Maria C', 'Wu, Jimin', 'Liu, Diane', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Li R', 'Donnella H', 'Knouse P', 'Raber M', 'Crawford K', 'Swartz MC', 'Wu J', 'Liu D', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160912,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Counseling/*methods', 'Diet', 'Early Intervention, Educational/*methods', '*Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Nutritional Status', 'Obesity/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Steroids/*pharmacology']",,,2016/09/13 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26231 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Feb;64(2):374-380. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26231.

We previously showed that mouse fetal liver (FL) hemato/vascular cells from day 12 of gestation (E12), expressing the Stem Cell Leukaemia (SCL) gene enhancer transgene (SCL-PLAP(+) cells), had robust endothelial engraftment potential when transferred to the blood stream of newborns or adult conditioned recipients, compared to the scarce vascular contribution of adult bone marrow cells. However, the specific SCL-PLAP(+) hematopoietic or endothelial cell subset responsible for the long-term reconstituting endothelial cell (LTR-EC) activity and its confinement to FL developmental stages remained unknown. Using a busulfan-treated newborn transplantation model, we show that LTR-EC activity is restricted to the SCL-PLAP(+) VE-cadherin(+) CD45(-) cell population, devoid of hematopoietic reconstitution activity and largely composed by Lyve1(+) endothelial-committed cells. SCL-PLAP(+) Ve-cadherin(+) CD45(-) cells contributed to the liver sinusoidal endothelium and also to the heart, kidney and lung microvasculature. LTR-EC activity was detected at different stages of FL development, yet marginal activity was identified in the adult liver, revealing unknown functional differences between fetal and adult liver endothelial/endothelial progenitors. Importantly, the observations that expanding donor-derived vascular grafts colocalize with proliferating hepatocyte-like cells and participate in the systemic circulation, support their functional integration into young livers.

The molecular markers may identify and quantify the residual blasts in B-ALL with normal cytology. In this study, we aimed to use combined IKZF1, IGH and IGK immunoglobulin genes for diagnosis and MRD monitoring in B-ALL sample using MLPA, multiplex PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. MATERIAL: We showed that multiplex PCR and MLPA are necessary and complementary to detect IKZF1 deletions. RESULTS: We have identified at the diagnosis clonal IGH rearrangement (VH3-JH5) and IKZF1 deletion (Delta4-7), which we have used it for MRD evaluation after induction chemotherapy. Despite the absence of chromosome abnormality, the patient may be classified in high-risk group with a relapse rate of residual blasts>10(-4) and sensitivity up to 10(-5). This molecular approach enabled the patient's stratification, which was overlooked by classical methods. CONCLUSION: The combined IKZF1 and immunoglobulin genes will be used as appropriate molecular tools for diagnosis and MRD assessment of B-lineage leukemias and introduced as a routine tests in Tunisian clinical laboratories. They will be useful to stratify patients into risk groups leading to better treatment strategy.","['Besbes, Sawsen', 'Hamadou, Walid-Sabri', 'Boulland, Marie-Laure', 'Lefranc, Marie-Paule', 'Ben Youssef, Yosra', 'Achour, Bechir', 'Khelif, Abderrahim', 'Fest, Thierry', 'Soua, Zohra']","['Besbes S', 'Hamadou WS', 'Boulland ML', 'Lefranc MP', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Achour B', 'Khelif A', 'Fest T', 'Soua Z']","['Universite de Sousse, faculte de medecine, laboratoire de biochimie, unite de recherche 14 ES 19, 4000 Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Universite de Sousse, faculte de medecine, laboratoire de biochimie, unite de recherche 14 ES 19, 4000 Sousse, Tunisia.', ""CHU Pontchaillou, service d'hematologie biologique, 35033 Rennes, France."", ""IGH, laboratoire d'immunogenetique moleculaire, 34396 Montpellier, France."", ""Universite de Sousse, faculte de medecine, laboratoire de biochimie, unite de recherche 14 ES 19, 4000 Sousse, Tunisia; CHU F.

Despite increasing treatment success, the relapse rate is still high. Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in the immune response to malignancies; thus, it is conceivable that NK cell-based immunotherapy may control relapses, while extending the disease-free survival. In our study, we investigated whether cryopreserved NK cells are able to kill the leukaemic K562 cell line, the necessity of IL-2 co-application and the association of activation marker expression (NKp44, NKG2D and CD25) with cytotoxic potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were added to NK cell cultures in different ratios, i.e. 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 (K562/NK), immediately after thawing NK cells or after 3-6-12-24 h of re-cultivation with or without IL-2. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated the ability of cryopreserved NK cells to kill K562 in all ratios, times and culture conditions. The number of dead K562 cells depended on the number of NK cells and on the presence of IL-2. NK cells cytotoxic potential decreased gradually in the culture without IL-2. In contrast, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity remained the same during the entire re-culture period after IL-2 re-application. CONCLUSION: Our study proved the efficacy of using cryopreserved ready-for-use NK cells in relapse treatment and the need for simultaneous administration of IL-2.","['Holubova, Monika', 'Miklikova, Michaela', 'Leba, Martin', 'Georgiev, Daniel', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Caprnda, Martin', 'Ciccocioppo, Rachele', 'Kruzliak, Peter', 'Lysak, Daniel']","['Holubova M', 'Miklikova M', 'Leba M', 'Georgiev D', 'Jindra P', 'Caprnda M', 'Ciccocioppo R', 'Kruzliak P', 'Lysak D']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical School and Teaching Hospital in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic. holubovam@fnplzen.cz.', 'Biomedical Centre, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic. holubovam@fnplzen.cz.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Alej Svobody 80, 304 60, Pilsen, Czech Republic. holubovam@fnplzen.cz.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical School and Teaching Hospital in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Centre, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'New Technologies for the Information Society European Centre of Excellence, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'New Technologies for the Information Society European Centre of Excellence, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Czech National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (CS-2), Pilsen, Czech Republic.', '2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Palackeho tr. 1/1946, 612 42, Brno, Czech Republic. kruzliakpeter@gmail.com.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Medical School and Teaching Hospital in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Centre, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160910,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Cryopreservation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/09/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2247-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2247-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Dec;142(12):2561-2567. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2247-8.

Since A-bomb radiation consists of a mixture of gamma-rays and neutrons, it is essential that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons is adequately evaluated if a study is to serve as a reference for cancer risk. However, the relatively small neutron component hampered the direct estimation of RBE in LSS data. To circumvent this problem, several strategies have been attempted, including dose-independent constant RBE, dose-dependent variable RBE, and dependence on the degrees of dominance of intermingled gamma-rays. By surveying the available literature, we tested the chromosomal RBE of neutrons as the biological endpoint for its equivalence to the microdosimetric quantities obtained using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) in various neutron fields. The radiation weighting factor, or quality factor, Qn, of neutrons as expressed in terms of the energy dependence of the maximum RBE, RBEm, was consistent with that predicted by the TEPC data, indicating that the chromosomally measured RBE was independent of the magnitude of coexisting gamma-rays. The obtained neutron RBE, which varied with neutron dose, was confirmed to be the most adequate RBE system in terms of agreement with the cancer incidence in A-bomb survivors, using chromosome aberrations as surrogate markers. With this RBE system, the cancer risk in A-bomb survivors as expressed in unit dose of reference radiation is equally compatible with Hiroshima and Nagasaki cities, and may be potentially applicable in other cases of human radiation exposure.","['Sasaki, Masao S', 'Endo, Satoru', 'Hoshi, Masaharu', 'Nomura, Taisei']","['Sasaki MS', 'Endo S', 'Hoshi M', 'Nomura T']","['Kyoto University and National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 17-12 Shironosato, Nagaokakyo-shi, Kyoto 617-0835, Japan masao.sasaki.43n@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Quantum Energy Application, Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-hiroshima, Hiroshima 739-8527, Japan.', 'Institute for Peace Science, Hiroshima University, 1-1-89 Higashisenda, Naka-ku, Hiroshima 730-0053, Japan.', 'National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, 7-6-8 Saito-Asagi, Ibaraki-shi, Osaka 567-0086, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160910,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Neutrons/*therapeutic use', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', '*Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World War II']",PMC5137296,,2016/09/11 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/09/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['rrw079 [pii]', '10.1093/jrr/rrw079 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2016 Nov;57(6):583-595. doi: 10.1093/jrr/rrw079.

We aimed to identify the efficacy of unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) in children with AML in the first complete remission and whether children resistant (IC1st-resistant; n = 38) or sensitive (IC1st-sensitive; n = 59) to the IC1st can achieve comparable outcomes. The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and severe chronic GVHD was .0% versus 20.1% (P = .038) and 21.7% versus 13.2% (P = .238), respectively, for the IC1st-resistant and IC1st-sensitive groups. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality was 22.2% versus 7.6% (P = .061) and 5.3% versus 10.8% (P = .364), respectively, for the IC1st-resistant and IC1st-sensitive groups. The 3-year probability of overall survival and disease-free survival was 76.3% versus 83.0% (P = .657) and 72.5% versus 81.6% (P = .396), respectively, for the IC1st-resistant and IC1st-sensitive groups. Multivariate analysis failed to show significant differences in survival rates between the groups. Thus, our results show that unmanipulated haplo-HSCT may overcome the poor prognostic significance of IC1st-resistance in children with AML, and it is valid as a postremission treatment for children with IC1st-resistant AML lacking an HLA-matched donor.","['Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Mo XD', 'Zhang XH', 'Xu LP', 'Wang Y', 'Yan CH', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Wang FR', 'Wang JZ', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.

One example of an affected chromosomal region is the gene coding for Nup214, a nucleoporin that localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We investigated two such fusion proteins, SET-Nup214 and SQSTM1 (sequestosome)-Nup214, both containing C-terminal portions of Nup214. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies containing the nuclear export receptor CRM1 were observed in the leukemia cell lines LOUCY and MEGAL. Overexpression of SET-Nup214 in HeLa cells leads to the formation of similar nuclear bodies that recruit CRM1, export cargo proteins, and certain nucleoporins and concomitantly affect nuclear protein and poly(A)(+) RNA export. SQSTM1-Nup214, although mostly cytoplasmic, also forms nuclear bodies and inhibits nuclear protein but not poly(A)(+) RNA export. The interaction of the fusion proteins with CRM1 is RanGTP-dependent, as shown in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and binding assays. Further analysis revealed that the Nup214 parts mediate the inhibition of nuclear export, whereas the SET or SQSTM1 part determines the localization of the fusion protein and therefore the extent of the effect. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies are highly mobile structures, which are in equilibrium with the nucleoplasm in interphase and disassemble during mitosis or upon treatment of cells with the CRM1-inhibitor leptomycin B. Strikingly, we found that nucleoporins can be released from nuclear bodies and reintegrated into existing NPC. Our results point to nuclear bodies as a means of preventing the formation of potentially insoluble and harmful protein aggregates that also may serve as storage compartments for nuclear transport factors.","['Port, Sarah A', 'Mendes, Adelia', 'Valkova, Christina', 'Spillner, Christiane', 'Fahrenkrog, Birthe', 'Kaether, Christoph', 'Kehlenbach, Ralph H']","['Port SA', 'Mendes A', 'Valkova C', 'Spillner C', 'Fahrenkrog B', 'Kaether C', 'Kehlenbach RH']","['From the Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine and the Gottingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), Georg August University, Gottingen, Humboldtallee 23, 37073 Gottingen, Germany.', 'the Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium, and.', 'the Leibniz Institute on Aging,Fritz Lipmann Institute, Beutenbergstrasse 11, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'From the Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine and the Gottingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), Georg August University, Gottingen, Humboldtallee 23, 37073 Gottingen, Germany.', 'the Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium, and.', 'the Leibniz Institute on Aging,Fritz Lipmann Institute, Beutenbergstrasse 11, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'From the Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine and the Gottingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), Georg August University, Gottingen, Humboldtallee 23, 37073 Gottingen, Germany, rkehlen@gwdg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Karyopherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly A/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5087727,,2016/10/30 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/09/11 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35680-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.735340 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Oct 28;291(44):23068-23083. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.735340.

METHODS: We identified cancer cases (n = 11,149) younger than age 6 years at diagnosis from the California Cancer Registry registered between 1988 and 2013. Controls (n = 270,147) were randomly sampled from California birth records, and frequency matched by year of birth to all childhood cancers during the study period. Exposure and covariate information were extracted from birth records. Unconditional logistic regression models were generated to assess the importance of pre-pregnancy diabetes, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational diabetes, and gestational weight gain on childhood cancer risk. RESULTS: We observed increased risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms' tumor in children of mothers with pre-pregnancy diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.37 (1.11, 1.69); OR (95 % CI) 1.45 (0.97, 2.18), respectively]. When born to mothers who were overweight prior to pregnancy (BMI 25-<30), children were at increased risk of leukemia [OR (95 % CI) 1.27 (1.01, 1.59)]. Insufficient gestational weight gain increased the risk of acute myeloid leukemia [OR (95 % CI) 1.50 (0.92, 2.42)] while excessive gestational weight gain increased the risk of astrocytomas [OR (95 % CI) 1.56 (0.97, 2.50)]. No associations were found between gestational diabetes and childhood cancer risk in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated elevated risks of several childhood cancers in the offspring of mothers who had diabetes and were overweight prior to pregnancy, as well as mothers who gained insufficient or excessive weight. Since few studies have focused on these factors in relation to childhood cancer, replication of our findings in future studies is warranted.","['Contreras, Zuelma A', 'Ritz, Beate', 'Virk, Jasveer', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Heck, Julia E']","['Contreras ZA', 'Ritz B', 'Virk J', 'Cockburn M', 'Heck JE']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, USC/Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. jeheck@ucla.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Mass Index', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Diabetes, Gestational/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Overweight/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy in Diabetics/*epidemiology', 'Weight Gain']",PMC5066566,,2016/09/11 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/09/11 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10552-016-0807-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-016-0807-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Oct;27(10):1273-85. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0807-5.

Chromosomal abnormalities form different subgroups with joint clinical specifications and results. t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13;q22) form core binding factor-AML (CBF-AML). c-kit mutation activation occurs in 12.8-46.1% of adults with CBF leukemia. These mutations occur in 20-25% of t(8;21) and 30% of inv(16) cases. METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched different databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Selected articles were measured based on the inclusion criteria of this study and initially compared in terms of titles or abstracts. Finally, articles relevant to the subject of this review were retrieved in full text. Twenty-two articles matched the inclusion criteria and were selected for this review. RESULTS: In this study, c-kit mutations were associated with poor prognosis in AML patients with t(8;21) and inv(16). In addition, these mutations had better prognostic effects on AML patients with inv(16) compared with those with t(8;21). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, c-kit mutations have intense, harmful effects on the relapse and white blood cell increase in CBF-AML adults.

Recently, high incidence of hyperlipidemia was reported to be associated with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and VCR/L-asparaginase therapy. The aim of this study is to test the effects of incremental increase in lipoproteins levels on vincristine disposition in rat. METHOD: To study VCR pharmacokinetics and protein binding, rats (n = 25) were assigned to three groups, normal lipidemic (NL), intermediate (IHL) and extreme hyperlipidemic (HL). Hyperlipidemia was induced by ip injection of (1 g/Kg) poloxamer 407 in rats. Serial blood samples were collected using the pre-inserted jugular vein cannula for 72 h post VCR (0.15 mg/Kg) i.v. dose. VCR unbound fractions in NL, IHL and HL plasma were determined using ultrafiltration kits. RESULTS: VCR demonstrated a rapid distribution phase (6-8 h) followed by a slower elimination phase with a mean elimination t(1/2) of ~ 14 h. VCR exhibited moderate binding to plasma proteins ~ 83 %. It showed a relatively small Vc (~0.17 L/Kg) and a larger Vbeta (1.53 L/Kg) indicating good tissue distribution. As the lipoproteins levels were increased, no significant changes were noted in VCR unbound fraction, plasma concentration, or volume of distribution indicating low affinity to lipoprotein binding. Induced HL also did not affect VCR elimination where similar VCR AUC0-infinity, Cl and elimination phase t(1/2) were reported along the different lipemic groups. CONCLUSION: Incremental increase in lipoprotein levels resulted in no significant effect on VCR disposition as such ALL malignant lymphoma and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients need not to worry about HL-VCR interaction. Whether, HL can potentiate another drug-drug or drug-disease interaction involving VCR warrants further studying and monitoring to ensure therapeutic safety and efficiency.","['Khalil, Hadeel A', 'Belal, Tarek S', 'El-Yazbi, Ahmed F', 'Hamdy, Dalia A']","['Khalil HA', 'Belal TS', 'El-Yazbi AF', 'Hamdy DA']","['Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, 1 El Khartoum Square, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt.', 'Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, 1 El Khartoum Square, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, 1 El Khartoum Square, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt. dr.daliahamdy@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,England,Lipids Health Dis,Lipids in health and disease,101147696,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Poloxamer/toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",PMC5017019,,2016/09/11 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/09/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12944-016-0318-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12944-016-0318-0 [pii]']",epublish,Lipids Health Dis. 2016 Sep 9;15:152. doi: 10.1186/s12944-016-0318-0.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Unbound fraction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we identified BTG2, MAP3K11, RPS6KA1 and PRDM1 as putative targets of miR-125b, which we verified using luciferase reporter constructs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of miR-125b targets is downregulated in leukemic cells in patients with APL.

A naturally occurring alternative splice event between zinc fingers three and four, removing or retaining three amino acids (+/-KTS), is believed to change the DNA binding affinity of WT1, although there are conflicting data regarding the binding affinity and motifs of the different isoforms. Increased expression of the WT1 -KTS isoform at the expense of the WT1 +KTS isoform is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined the genome-wide binding pattern of WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS in leukemic K562 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We discovered that the WT1 -KTS isoform predominantly binds close to transcription start sites and to enhancers, in a similar fashion to other transcription factors, whereas WT1 +KTS binding is enriched within gene bodies. We observed a significant overlap between WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes, despite the binding sites being distinct. Motif discovery revealed distinct binding motifs for the isoforms, some of which have been previously reported as WT1 binding sites. Additional analyses showed that both WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes are more likely to be transcribed than non-targets, and are involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and development. Our study provides evidence that WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS share target genes yet still bind distinct locations, indicating isoform-specific regulation in transcription of genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, consistent with the involvement of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Ullmark, Tove', 'Jarvstrat, Linnea', 'Sanden, Carl', 'Montano, Giorgia', 'Jernmark-Nilsson, Helena', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Drott, Kristina', 'Vidovic, Karina', 'Nilsson, Bjorn', 'Gullberg, Urban']","['Ullmark T', 'Jarvstrat L', 'Sanden C', 'Montano G', 'Jernmark-Nilsson H', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Lennartsson A', 'Fioretos T', 'Drott K', 'Vidovic K', 'Nilsson B', 'Gullberg U']","['Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Huddinge, Sweden urban.gullberg@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160909,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5286941,,2016/09/11 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/09/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.149815 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.149815 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Feb;102(2):336-345. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.149815.

However, many of these drugs are associated with cardiovascular toxicities that are sometimes dose-limiting. Moreover, the long-term cardiovascular consequences of these drugs, some of which are used chronically, are not yet known. Although the scope and mechanisms of the cardiac toxicities are better defined, the mechanisms for vascular toxicities are only beginning to be elucidated. This review summarizes what is known about the vascular adverse events associated with three classes of novel anti-cancer therapies: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, breakpoint cluster-Abelson (BCR-ABL) kinase inhibitors used to treat chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) used in myeloma therapeutics. Three of the best described vascular toxicities are reviewed including hypertension, increased risk of acute cardiovascular ischaemic events and arteriovenous thrombosis. The available data regarding the mechanism by which each therapy causes vascular complication are summarized. When data are limited, potential mechanisms are inferred from the known effects of inhibiting each target on vascular cell function and disease. Enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular side effects of targeted cancer therapy is necessary to effectively manage cancer patients and to design safer targeted cancer therapies for the future.","['Gopal, Srila', 'Miller, Kenneth B', 'Jaffe, Iris Z']","['Gopal S', 'Miller KB', 'Jaffe IZ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, U.S.A.

Nanosizing of such drugs can help to improve the solubility and this may result in enhanced anticancer activities too. Moreover, over dosages and the accompanying side effects of NSAIDs can be minimized by improving their solubility and bioavailability. Successful nanoformulation of three NSAIDs: ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprufen (KP) and naproxen (NAP) using a novel evaporation assisted solvent-antisolvent interaction (EASAI) method is reported here. Three water soluble and biocompatible polymers: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were used to stabilize the drug nanoparticles. Particles having spherical morphology with average size below 30nm were thoroughly characterized using dynamic light scattering and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) imaging. The nanoformulation resulted in ten to fifteen fold improvements in the solubility and significant enhancement in the in-vitro drug release profiles of the NSAIDs. Anticancer screening of the nanoformulated NSAIDs against five different cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 (Human breast cancer cell line), (Human pancreatic cancer cell line) MIA-PA-CA-2, (Human colon cancer cell line) HT-29, (Human leukemia cell line) Jurkat and (human ovarian carcinoma cell line) A2780 was performed. All the nanoformulated samples showed improved anticancer activity against the Leukemia cancer cell line, out of which NAP-PVP showed the highest anti-cancer activity.

Aurora kinases, a family of serine/threonine kinases, play a key role in regulating cell division and mitosis and are linked to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis in many human cancers including leukemia and lymphoma. Danusertib (Danu) is a pan-inhibitor of Aurora kinases with few data available in leukemia therapy. This study aimed to identify new molecular targets for Aurora kinase inhibition in human leukemia cells using quantitative proteomic analysis followed by verification experiments. There were at least 2932 proteins responding to Danu treatment, including AURKB, p70S6K, and RPL15, and 603 functional proteins and 245 canonical signaling pathways were involved in regulating cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, and autophagy. The proteomic data suggested that Danu-regulated RPL15 signaling might contribute to the cancer cell killing effect. Our verification experiments confirmed that Danu negatively regulated AURKB/p70S6K/RPL15 axis with the involvement of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, AMPK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, leading to the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in human leukemia cells. Further studies are warranted to verify the feasibility via targeting AURKB/p70S6K/RPL15 axis for leukemia therapy.","['He, Si-Jia', 'Shu, Li-Ping', 'Zhou, Zhi-Wei', 'Yang, Tianxin', 'Duan, Wei', 'Zhang, Xueji', 'He, Zhi-Xu', 'Zhou, Shu-Feng']","['He SJ', 'Shu LP', 'Zhou ZW', 'Yang T', 'Duan W', 'Zhang X', 'He ZX', 'Zhou SF']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center & Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Laboratory Animal Center, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center & Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Laboratory Animal Center, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah and Salt Lake Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria 3217, Australia.', 'Research Center for Bioengineering and Sensing Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center & Sino-US Joint Laboratory for Medical Sciences, Laboratory Animal Center, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.

Functional cilia are required for the response to developmental signaling pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt/beta-catenin. Although the Hh pathway has been shown to be active in leukemia and other blood cancers, there have been no reports describing the presence of primary cilia in human blood or leukemia cells. In the present study, we show that nearly all human blood and bone marrow cells have primary cilia (97-99%). In contrast, primary cilia on AML cell lines (KG1, KG1a, and K562) were less frequent (10-36% of cells) and were often shorter and dysmorphic, with less well-defined basal bodies. Finally, we show that treatment of blood cells with the Hh pathway ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) causes translocation of Smoothened (SMO) to the primary cilia and activation of Hh target genes, demonstrating that primary cilia in blood cells are functional and participate in Hh signaling. Loss of primary cilia on leukemia cells may have important implications for aberrant pathway activation and response to SMO inhibitors currently in clinical development.","['Singh, Mohan', 'Chaudhry, Parvesh', 'Merchant, Akil A']","['Singh M', 'Chaudhry P', 'Merchant AA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Large screens of drugs, efficacious for non-cancer disease, are currently being used to identify candidates for repurposing based on their anti-cancer properties. Here, we show that low-dose salinomycin, a coccidiostat ionophore previously identified in a breast cancer screen, has anti-leukemic efficacy. AML and MLLr cell lines, primary cells and patient samples were sensitive to submicromolar salinomycin. Most strikingly, colony formation of normal hematopoietic cells was unaffected by salinomycin, demonstrating a lack of hemotoxicity at the effective concentrations. Furthermore, salinomycin treatment of primary cells resulted in loss of leukemia repopulation ability following transplantation, as demonstrated by extended recipient survival compared to controls. Bioinformatic analysis of a 17-gene signature identified and validated in primary MLLr cells, uncovered immunomodulatory pathways, hubs and protein interactions as potential transducers of low dose salinomycin treatment. Additionally, increased protein expression of p62/Sqstm1, encoded for by one of the 17 signature genes, demonstrates a role for salinomycin in aggresome/vesicle formation indicative of an autophagic response.Together, the data support the efficacy of salinomycin as an anti-leukemic at non-hemotoxic concentrations.

However, immunophenotypic characterization of these cancer stem cells remains sparse. In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we have previously described aberrant expression of the C-type lectin domain family 12, member A (CLEC12A) as a stable and reliable marker of leukaemia blasts and as a tool for assessing minimal residual disease. Furthermore, CLEC12A has been proposed as a promising marker of leukaemic stem cells in AML. The role of CLEC12A in MDS, however, remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found CLEC12A aberrantly expressed on the CD34(+) CD38(-) cell compartment in 71% (22/31) of MDS patients, distributed across all Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk groups. We showed that the CD34(+) CD38(-) CLEC12A(+) cells were indeed malignant and possessed functional stem cell properties in the long-term colony-initiating cell assay. As opposed to reported findings in AML, we showed that cancer stem cells from MDS samples derived from both CLEC12A positive and negative CD34(+) CD38(-) subpopulations. Due to the absence of CLEC12A on normal haematopoietic stem cells, CLEC12A stem cell immunophenotyping may contribute to diagnosing and monitoring MDS patients and could furthermore add knowledge about disease propagating cells in MDS.","['Toft-Petersen, Marie', 'Nederby, Line', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Kerndrup, Gitte B', 'Brown, Gordon D', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Stidsholt Roug, Anne']","['Toft-Petersen M', 'Nederby L', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Kerndrup GB', 'Brown GD', 'Hokland P', 'Stidsholt Roug A']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. marie.toft-petersen@clin.au.dk.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Immunity, Infection and Inflammation Programme, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Mitogen/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5091626,,2016/10/28 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14270 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Nov;175(3):393-401. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14270.

However, the majority subsequently relapse and die of the disease. A leukemia stem cell (LSC) paradigm has been invoked to explain this failure of CR to reliably translate into cure. Indeed, LSCs are highly enriched in CD34+CD38- leukemic cells that exhibit positive aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH+) on flow cytometry, these LSCs are resistant to currently existing treatments in AML such as cytarabine and anthracycline that, at the cost of great toxicity on normal cells, are highly active against the leukemic bulk, but spare the LSCs responsible for relapse. To try to combat the LSC population selectively, a well-characterized ALDH inhibitor by the trivial name of dimethyl ampal thiolester (DIMATE) was assessed on sorted CD34+CD38- subpopulations from AML patients and healthy patients. ALDH activity and cell viability were monitored by flow cytometry. From enzyme kinetic studies DIMATE is an active enzyme-dependent, competitive, irreversible inhibitor of ALDH1. On cells in culture, DIMATE is a powerful inhibitor of ALDHs 1 and 3, has a major cytotoxic activity on human AML cell lines. Moreover, DIMATE is highly active against leukemic populations enriched in LSCs, but, unlike conventional chemotherapy, DIMATE is not toxic for healthy hematopoietic stem cells which retained, after treatment, their self-renewing and multi-lineage differentiation capacity in immunodeficient mice, xenografted with human leukemic cells. DIMATE eradicates specifically human AML cells and spares healthy mouse hematologic cells.","['Venton, G', 'Perez-Alea, M', 'Baier, C', 'Fournet, G', 'Quash, G', 'Labiad, Y', 'Martin, G', 'Sanderson, F', 'Poullin, P', 'Suchon, P', 'Farnault, L', 'Nguyen, C', 'Brunet, C', 'Ceylan, I', 'Costello, R T']","['Venton G', 'Perez-Alea M', 'Baier C', 'Fournet G', 'Quash G', 'Labiad Y', 'Martin G', 'Sanderson F', 'Poullin P', 'Suchon P', 'Farnault L', 'Nguyen C', 'Brunet C', 'Ceylan I', 'Costello RT']","['Aix-Marseille Universite, INSERM, UMR1090, TAGC Campus, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular therapy, AP-HM, Conception Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Advanced BioDesign, Lyon, France.', ""Lab Animal Models and Cancer Laboratory Anatomy Pathology Program, Institut de Recerca Valld' Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, INSERM, UMR1090, TAGC Campus, Marseille, France.', 'Advanced BioDesign, Lyon, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, ICBMS UMR5246, Villeurbanne, France.', 'Advanced BioDesign, Lyon, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, INSERM, UMR1090, TAGC Campus, Marseille, France.', 'Advanced BioDesign, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Apheresis and Autotransfusion, APHM, Conception Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Apheresis and Autotransfusion, APHM, Conception Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology laboratory, APHM, Hopital de la Timone, Marseille, France.', 'UMR 1062 NORT, INSERM, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular therapy, AP-HM, Conception Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, INSERM, UMR1090, TAGC Campus, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology laboratory, APHM, Hopital de la Conception, Marseille, France.', 'Advanced BioDesign, Lyon, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, INSERM, UMR1090, TAGC Campus, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular therapy, AP-HM, Conception Hospital, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Alkynes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC5056970,,2016/09/10 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201678 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.78 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Sep 9;6(9):e469. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.78.,,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (dimethylthioampal)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate their potential pathogenetic role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a biologically and clinically heterogeneous neoplasia, we investigated lncRNAs expression in a prospective series of 217 early-stage Binet A CLL patients and 26 different subpopulations of normal B-cells, through a custom annotation pipeline of microarray data. Our study identified a 24-lncRNA-signature specifically deregulated in CLL compared with the normal B-cell counterpart. Importantly, this classifier was validated on an independent data set of CLL samples. Belonging to the lncRNA signature characterizing distinct molecular CLL subgroups, we identified lncRNAs recurrently associated with adverse prognostic markers, such as unmutated IGHV status, CD38 expression, 11q and 17p deletions, and NOTCH1 mutations. In addition, correlation analyses predicted a putative lncRNAs interplay with genes and miRNAs expression. Finally, we generated a 2-lncRNA independent risk model, based on lnc-IRF2-3 and lnc-KIAA1755-4 expression, able to distinguish three different prognostic groups in our series of early-stage patients. Overall, our study provides an important resource for future studies on the functions of lncRNAs in CLL, and contributes to the discovery of novel molecular markers with clinical relevance associated with the disease.","['Ronchetti, D', 'Manzoni, M', 'Agnelli, L', 'Vinci, C', 'Fabris, S', 'Cutrona, G', 'Matis, S', 'Colombo, M', 'Galletti, S', 'Taiana, E', 'Recchia, A G', 'Bossio, S', 'Gentile, M', 'Musolino, C', 'Di Raimondo, F', 'Grilli, A', 'Bicciato, S', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Tassone, P', 'Morabito, F', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Neri, A']","['Ronchetti D', 'Manzoni M', 'Agnelli L', 'Vinci C', 'Fabris S', 'Cutrona G', 'Matis S', 'Colombo M', 'Galletti S', 'Taiana E', 'Recchia AG', 'Bossio S', 'Gentile M', 'Musolino C', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Grilli A', 'Bicciato S', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Tassone P', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","['Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS-A.O.U.

Aberrant pre-BCR signaling is considered as a key factor for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) development. BCP-ALL are believed to be arrested at the pre-BCR checkpoint independent of pre-BCR expression. However, the cellular stage at which BCP-ALL are arrested and whether this relates to expression of the pre-BCR components (IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1) is still unclear. Here, we show differential protein expression and copy number variation (CNV) patterns of the pre-BCR components in pediatric BCP-ALL. Moreover, analyzing six BCP-ALL data sets (n = 733), we demonstrate that TCF3-PBX1 ALL express high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1, and are arrested at the pre-B stage. By contrast, ETV6-RUNX1 ALL express low levels of IGHM or VPREB1, and are arrested at the pro-B stage. Irrespective of subtype, ALL with high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1 are arrested at the pre-B stage and correlate with good prognosis in high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL (n = 207). Our findings suggest that BCP-ALL are arrested at different cellular stages, which relates to the expression pattern of the pre-BCR components that could serve as prognostic markers for high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL patients.","['Chen, Dongfeng', 'Zheng, Junxiong', 'Gerasimcik, Natalija', 'Lagerstedt, Kristina', 'Sjogren, Helene', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Martensson, Inga-Lill']","['Chen D', 'Zheng J', 'Gerasimcik N', 'Lagerstedt K', 'Sjogren H', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Martensson IL']","['Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heavy Chain Disease/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Pre-B Cell Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5017602,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/10 06:00,2017/08/12 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0162638 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-25654 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Sep 9;11(9):e0162638. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0162638. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (IGHM protein, human)', '0 (IGLL1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B Cell Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (VPREB1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, novel BCR-ABL1 fusion variants can be undetected by qRT-PCR-based routine molecular screening, affecting immediate patient management and proper treatment selection. In this study, we describe a case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) harboring a novel BCR-ABL1 variant gene. Although Fluorescent In situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis suggested Philadelphia (Ph) translocation, qRT-PCR screening failed to detect the presence of a functional fusion transcript, which is critical for selecting targeted therapy against BCR-ABL1 fusion with aberrant kinase activity. Meanwhile, G-band cytogenetic analysis was performed twice without a solid conclusion. To overcome the uncertainty whether TKIs should be used to treat this patient effectively, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform and discovered an unusual e13a2-like BCR-ABL1 fusion with 9 ABL1 intron 1 nucleotides incorporated into the broken BCR exon 13 to form a novel chimeric exon, which has never been described previously based on the best of our knowledge. Based on FISH and NGS results, the patient was treated with imatinib, showing significant improvement. Moreover, we also detected novel genetic mutations in the known leukemic genes SETBP1, PAX5, and TP53, while their role in the leukemogenesis remains to be determined. In summary, we have identified BCR-ABL1 fusion and other genetic mutations in a diagnostically difficult case of CML, demonstrating that NGS is a powerful diagnostic tool when routine procedures are challenged.","['Fu, Shuang', 'Hu, Yanping', 'Fu, Yu', 'Chen, Fang', 'Liu, Xuan', 'Zhang, Minyu', 'Wang, Xiaohui', 'Tu, Shichun', 'Zhang, Jihong']","['Fu S', 'Hu Y', 'Fu Y', 'Chen F', 'Liu X', 'Zhang M', 'Wang X', 'Tu S', 'Zhang J']","['a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.', 'b Shanghai Yuanqi Bio-pharmaceutical Company Ltd , Shanghai , China.', 'a Hematology Laboratory , Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160910,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,,,PMC5079385,,2016/09/10 06:00,2016/09/10 06:01,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:01 [medline]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1219821 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Oct 2;17(10):1003-1009. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1219821.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study of 34 patients (19 women, 15 men; mean age, 51 years; range, 18-72 years) treated for CNS leukemia between 2006 and 2011, 31 (91%) contrast-enhanced brain and 14 (41%) spine MRI studies were reviewed by two radiologists to note patterns of enhancement. Interobserver agreement and correlation of enhancement with outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: MRI showed abnormal findings in 25 patients (74%). Pachymeningeal enhancement (n = 9/31, 29%), leptomeningeal enhancement (n = 6/31, 19%), cranial nerve enhancement (n = 9/31, 29%), masslike enhancement (n = 3/31, 10%), and spinal meningeal enhancement (n = 10/14, 71%) were identified. There was strong interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.906). Survival rates were shorter to a statistically significant degree with pachymeningeal enhancement (median, 7 months; interquartile range [IQR], 5-8 months versus median, 26 months; IQR, 15 months to not reached; p = 0.004) and two or more sites of enhancement (median, 8 months; IQR, 3-13 months versus median, 19 months; IQR, 9 months to not reached; p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Brain or spine MRI examinations (or both) showed abnormal findings in nearly three-fourths of adults with acute leukemia with positive CSF cytology who were imaged for neurologic symptoms. Pachymeningeal enhancement and two or more sites of brain involvement were associated with shorter survival.","['Guenette, Jeffrey P', 'Tirumani, Sree Harsha', 'Keraliya, Abhishek R', 'Shinagare, Atul B', 'Ramaiya, Nikhil H', 'Jagannathan, Jyothi P']","['Guenette JP', 'Tirumani SH', 'Keraliya AR', 'Shinagare AB', 'Ramaiya NH', 'Jagannathan JP']","[""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", ""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", '2 Department of Imaging, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", ""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", '2 Department of Imaging, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", '2 Department of Imaging, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""1 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", '2 Department of Imaging, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

While their etiology is not completely understood, evidence suggests that certain chromosomal abnormalities contribute to MDS and AML progression. Among the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in these disorders are alterations of chromosome 7: either complete loss of one copy of chromosome 7 (-7) or partial deletion of 7q (del(7q)), both of which increase the risk of progression from MDS to AML and are associated with chemoresistance. Notably, 7q36.1, a critical minimally deleted region in 7q, includes the gene encoding the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), which is also mutated in a small percentage of AML patients. However, the mechanisms by which MLL3 loss contributes to malignancy are unknown. Using an engineered mouse model expressing a catalytically inactive form of Mll3, we found a significant shift in hematopoiesis toward the granulocyte/macrophage lineage, correlating with myeloid infiltration and enlargement of secondary lymphoid organs. Therefore, we propose that MLL3 loss in patients may contribute to the progression of MDS and AML by promoting myelopoiesis.","['Arcipowski, Kelly M', 'Bulic, Marinka', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Arcipowski KM', 'Bulic M', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology/Hematopathology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'The University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC5017600,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/10 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0162515 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-16521 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Sep 9;11(9):e0162515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0162515. eCollection 2016.,"['P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA180475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA080621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL3 protein, mouse)']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3942-1369'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these PARP genes, poly ADP-ribose polymerase family, member 15 (PARP15) is a candidate gene for cancer development due to its ability to regulate gene transcription and its reported association with apoptosis. The current study investigated the possible association between PARP15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, we analyzed the effects of the PARP15 polymorphisms on the clinical phenotypes associated with cytosine arabinose (AraC) chemotherapy in AML patients. METHODS: Ten PARP15 polymorphisms were genotyped via TaqMan assay in a total of 344 Korean subjects, including 103 AML patients and 241 normal controls. The genetic effects of the polymorphisms on the risk of AML and the clinical phenotypes were analyzed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software. RESULTS: The results from a Cox regression analysis for overall survival revealed that two polymorphisms were associated with increased overall survival and the signal for rs17208928 was retained after correcting for multiple tests (p(corr) < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility that the PARP15 gene may be a potential therapeutic target in AML patients although much larger scale studies are needed for validation.","['Lee, Min Kyung', 'Cheong, Hyun Sub', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Shin, Hyoung Doo']","['Lee MK', 'Cheong HS', 'Koh Y', 'Ahn KS', 'Yoon SS', 'Shin HD']","['1 Department of Life Science, Sogang University , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Genetic Epidemiology, SNP Genetics, Inc. , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '5 Functional Genome Institute , PDXen Biosystem, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '6 Clinical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '1 Department of Life Science, Sogang University , Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Genetic Epidemiology, SNP Genetics, Inc. , Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Republic of Korea', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/10 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2016.0007 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2016 Nov;20(11):696-701. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2016.0007.

Regulation by protein kinase activities.,70,10.1186/s12935-016-0345-y [doi],"BACKGROUND: The glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) is a safe, potentially useful anti-tumour drug, but its efficacy is normally low when used alone. Recent studies indicated that 2-DG stimulates the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK defensive pathways, which limits the apoptotic efficacy in tumour cell lines. We hypothesized that co-treatment with selected polyphenols could improve 2-DG-provoked apoptosis by preventing defensive kinase activation. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting or the MTT assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis were determined by propidium iodide staining and/or annexin V labeling followed by flow cytometry. Mitochondria pore transition and depolarization were determined by calcein-ATM or rhodamine 123 labeling followed flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species and GSH were determined by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate or monochlorobimane labeling followed by flow cytometry or fluorimetry. Expression and phosphorylation of protein kinases were analyzed by the Western blot. RESULTS: (i) 2-DG-provoked apoptosis was greatly potentiated by co-treatment with the sub-lethal concentrations of the flavonoid quercetin in human HL60 acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. Allowing for quantitative differences, apoptosis potentiation was also obtained using NB4 promyelocytic and THP-1 promonocytic cells, using curcumin or genistein instead of quercetin, and using lonidamine instead of 2-DG, but not when 2-DG was substituted by incubation in glucose-free medium. (ii) Quercetin and 2-DG rapidly elicited the opening of mitochondria pore transition, which preceded the trigger of apoptosis. (iii) Treatments did not affect GSH levels, and caused disparate effects on reactive oxygen species generation, which did not match the changes in lethality. (iv) 2-DG and lonidamine stimulated defensive Akt and ERK phosphorylation/activation, while glucose starvation was ineffective. Polyphenols prevented the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation, and in some cases also ERK phosphorylation. In addition, quercetin and 2-DG stimulated GSK-3alpha,beta phosphorylation/inactivation, although with different isoform specificity. The use of pharmacologic inhibitors confirmed the importance of these kinase modifications for apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present in vitro observations suggest that co-treatment with low concentrations of selected polyphenols might represent a manner of improving the poor anti-tumour efficacy of some glycolytic inhibitors, and that apoptosis potentiation may be at least in part explained by the regulation of defensive protein kinase activities.","['de Blas, Elena', 'Estan, Maria Cristina', 'Del Carmen Gomez de Frutos, Maria', 'Ramos, Javier', 'Del Carmen Boyano-Adanez, Maria', 'Aller, Patricio']","['de Blas E', 'Estan MC', 'Del Carmen Gomez de Frutos M', 'Ramos J', 'Del Carmen Boyano-Adanez M', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain ; Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain ; Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain ; Escuela Tecnica Superior de Ingenieros Agronomos, Universidad Politecnica, Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CIB), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,PMC5015235,,2016/09/10 06:00,2016/09/10 06:01,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-016-0345-y [doi]', '345 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2016 Sep 7;16(1):70. doi: 10.1186/s12935-016-0345-y. eCollection 2016.,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4405-9541'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-Deoxy-d-glucose', 'Acute myeloid leukemia cells', 'Apoptosis', 'Lonidamine', 'Natural polyphenols', 'Oxidative stress', 'Protein kinases (Akt, ERKs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ALV-J strain NX0101, which was isolated from broiler breeders in 2001, mainly induced formation of myeloid cell tumors. However, strain HN10PY01, which was recently isolated from laying hens, mainly induces formation of myeloid cell tumors and hemangioma. To identify the molecular pathological mechanism underlying changes in host susceptibility and tumor classification induced by these two types of ALV-J strains, chicken embryo fibroblasts derived from chickens with different genetic backgrounds (broiler breeders and laying hens) and an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblasts (DF-1) were prepared and infected with strain NX0101 or HN10PY01, respectively. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and levels of ALV group-specific antigen p27 and heat shock protein 70 in the supernatant collected from the ALV-J infected cells were detected. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of tumor-related genes p53, c-myc, and Bcl-2 in ALV-J-infected cells were quantified. The results indicated that the infection of ALV-J could significantly increase mRNA expression levels of p53, c-myc, and Bcl-2 Strain HN10PY01 exhibited a greater influence on the three tumor-related genes in each of the three types of cells when compared with strain NX0101, and the TCID50 and p27 levels in the supernatant collected from HN10PY01-infected cells were higher than those collected from NX0101-infected cells. These results indicate that the infection of the two ALV-J strains influenced the gene expression levels in the infected cells, while the newly isolated strain HN10PY01 showed higher replication ability in cells and induced higher expression levels of tumor-related genes in infected cells. Furthermore, virus titers and expression levels of tumor-related genes and cellular stress responses of cells with different genetic backgrounds when infected with each of the two ALV-J strain were different, indicating that genetic backgrounds influenced the capabilities of the virus to infect and proliferate. The findings of this study provide useful data to further elucidate the mechanism underlying host susceptibility and tumor classification in ALV-J-infected chickens and cells.","['Qu, Yajin', 'Liu, Litao', 'Niu, Yujuan', 'Qu, Yue', 'Li, Ning', 'Sun, Wei', 'Lv, Chuanwei', 'Wang, Pengfei', 'Zhang, Guihua', 'Liu, Sidang']","['Qu Y', 'Liu L', 'Niu Y', 'Qu Y', 'Li N', 'Sun W', 'Lv C', 'Wang P', 'Zhang G', 'Liu S']","[""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", 'College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science, Liaoning Medical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, 121000, China.', ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Road, Tai'an 271000, China liusidang@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160609,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*physiology', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', '*Chickens', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Phenotype', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",,,2016/09/10 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0032-5791(19)31766-3 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pew180 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2016 Oct 1;95(10):2383-90. doi: 10.3382/ps/pew180.

Considering the fact that neoplastic lymphoid precursors in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carry a three- to four-fold NK1R expression as compared to normal lymphocytes, using NK1R antagonist seems to be noteworthy in the treatment of ALL patients. In this study, we found that inhibition of NK1R with aprepitant, a selective high-affinity antagonist of the human NK1R, exerts cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects against pre-B ALL-derived Nalm-6 cells either as single drug or in combination with doxorubicin. Our data showed that treatment of the cells with the inhibitor resulted in apoptotic cell death, at least partly, through abrogation of PI3K/Akt pathway, as revealed by the reduction of phospho/total Akt ratio. In agreement with the inhibitory effect on Akt, we also found that aprepitant increased the expression level of p21 and p27, which in turn leads to the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest. Overall, this study recommends mechanistic pathways by which inhibition of NK1R can augment apoptotic cell death through a plausible p53-dependent pathway rather than NF-kappaB-depended mechanism in pre-B ALL cells; however, further studies are needed to better characterize the application of NK1R inhibition in clinical cancer treatment.","['Bayati, Samaneh', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Bayati S', 'Bashash D', 'Ahmadian S', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, P.O.

Here, we show that PML is phosphorylated at T409 (PML p409) in a mitosis-specific manner. More importantly, PML p409 contributes to maintain the duration of pro-metaphase and regulates spindle checkpoint. Deficient PML p409 caused a shortening of pro-metaphase and challenged the nocodazole-triggered mitotic arrest. T409A mutation led to a higher frequency of misaligned chromosomes on metaphase plate, and subsequently death in late mitosis. In addition, inhibition of PML p409 repressed growth of tumor cells, suggesting that PML p409 is a potential target for cancer therapy. Collectively, our study demonstrated an important phosphorylated site of PML, which contributed to explore the role of PML in mitosis.","['Jin, J', 'Liu, J']","['Jin J', 'Liu J']","['Harbin Medical University Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Harbin China einfachjjf@aliyun.com.', 'Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Beijing China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160831,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epitopes/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Mitosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphothreonine/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism']",,,2016/09/10 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/09/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2016 Aug 31;62(10):75-9.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the accuracy of placing Ommaya reservoirs using neuronavigation and a flexible neuroendoscope to verify catheter positioning. METHODS: Ommaya reservoirs placed in 25 oncology patients between 2013 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five ventricular catheters were placed using the AxiEM stealth frameless neuronavigation system and a flexible neuroendoscope. Postoperative catheter accuracy, operative complications, and postoperative complications were assessed. We discuss surgical protocol and technical nuances. RESULTS: All ventricular catheters were successfully placed into the ipsilateral (84%) or contralateral (16%) foramen of Monro. A single ventricular catheter pass was needed to cannulate the ventricle in 96% of patients. The mean accuracy was 4.09 +/- 3.47 mm from the target, the ipsilateral foramen of Monro. One patient had a catheter tract hemorrhage seen on postoperative imaging related to thrombocytopenia. No postoperative neurologic deficits were seen. CONCLUSIONS: A combined neuronavigation and neuroendoscopic approach improved catheter tip accuracy compared with accuracy rates described in the literature using other techniques. This approach can be adapted toward routine clinical practice of placing ventricular shunt catheters and Ommaya reservoirs.","['Wang, Arthur', 'Tenner, Michael S', 'Tobias, Michael E', 'Mohan, Avinash', 'Kim, Dolly', 'Tandon, Adesh']","['Wang A', 'Tenner MS', 'Tobias ME', 'Mohan A', 'Kim D', 'Tandon A']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, New York Medical College, Westchester, New York, USA.

The possible mechanisms of As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity include DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cardiac ion channel changes and apoptosis. The present study is designed to investigate the protective effects of imperatorin and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol and to explore their mechanistic involvement in As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: Cell viability assay, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining, Caspase-3 activity assay, ROS generation, cellular calcium levels, mRNA expression levels by qRT-PCR and protein expression levels by Western blotting were measured in H9c2 cells in combination with As2O3 and imperatorin or sec-O-glucosylhamaudol. KEY RESULTS: We observed that H9c2 cells treated with imperatorin or sec-O-glucosylhamaudol were more resistant to As2O3-induced cell death. Both imperatorin and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol reduced H9c2 cell apoptosis, but both imperatorin and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol had no effects on Caspase-3 activity and intracellular calcium accumulation. Furthermore, imperatorin was capable of suppressing ROS generation, while sec-O-glucosylhamaudol did not show this effect. Moreover, imperatorin and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol triggered Nrf2 activation, which resulted in upregulation of downstream phase II metabolic enzymes and antioxidant protein/enzyme, probably offering cellular protection to As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity via the Nrf2 signal pathway. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Imperatorin and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol can ameliorate As2O3-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in H9c2 cells, the mechanisms probably related to antioxidation. As2O3 in combination with imperatorin or sec-O-glucosylhamaudol could be considered as a novel strategy to expand the clinical application of As2O3.","['Hu, Liufang', 'Sun, Jianhui', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Wang, Lifang', 'Wei, Yuna', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhu, Yaying', 'Huo, Hairu', 'Tan, Yuqing']","['Hu L', 'Sun J', 'Li H', 'Wang L', 'Wei Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Huo H', 'Tan Y']","['Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.

The resulting cells showed growth dependent on LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and expression of multiple stem cell markers. Furthermore, the iPS cells caused teratoma formation with three layers of differentiation and had both active X chromosomes (XaXa). Our iPS cells satisfied the both of important characteristics of stem cells: teratoma formation and activation of both X chromosomes. Injection of these iPS cells into morula stage embryos showed that these cells participate in the early stage of porcine embryogenesis. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq analysis detected that expression levels of endogenous pluripotent related genes, NANOG, SOX2, ZFP42, OCT3/4, ESRRB, and ERAS were much higher in iPS with six factors than that with four reprogramming factors. We can conclude that the expression of six reprogramming factors enables the creation of porcine iPS cells, which is partially close to naive iPS state. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 537-553, 2017.

There is a constant search out of new potential therapeutic molecule to combat this disorder. In most cases, patients with FA develop haematological malignancies with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Identifying drugs which can efficiently block the pathways of both these disorders can be an ideal and novel strategy to treat FA. The curcumin, a natural compound obtained from turmeric is an interesting therapeutic molecule as it has been reported in the literature to combat both FA as well as leukemia. However, its complete mechanism is not elucidated. Herein, a systems biology approach for elucidating the therapeutic potential of curcumin against FA and leukemia is investigated by analyzing the computational molecular interactions of curcumin ligand with FANC G of FA and seven other key disease targets of leukemia. The proteins namely DOT1L, farnesyl transferase (FDPS), histone decetylase (EP3000), Polo-like kinase (PLK-2), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), tyrosine kinase (ABL1), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) were chosen as disease targets for leukemia and modeled structure of FANC G protein as the disease target for FA. The docking investigations showed that curcumin had a very high binding affinity of -8.1 kcal/mol with FANC G protein. The key disease targets of leukemia namely tyrosine kinase (ABL1), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), and polo-like kinase (PLK-2) showed that they had the comparable binding affinities of -9.7 k cal/mol, -8.7 k cal/mol, and -8.6 k cal/mol, respectively with curcumin. Further, the percentage similarity scores obtained from PAM50 using EMBOSS MATCHER was shown to provide a clue to understand the structural relationships to an extent and to predict the binding affinity. This investigation shows that curcumin effectively interacts with the disease targets of both FA and leukemia.","['Mahato, David', 'Samanta, Dipayan', 'Mukhopadhyay, Sudit S', 'Krishnaraj, R Navanietha']","['Mahato D', 'Samanta D', 'Mukhopadhyay SS', 'Krishnaraj RN']","['a Department of Biotechnology , National Institute of Technology , Durgapur , West Bengal , India.', 'a Department of Biotechnology , National Institute of Technology , Durgapur , West Bengal , India.', 'a Department of Biotechnology , National Institute of Technology , Durgapur , West Bengal , India.', 'a Department of Biotechnology , National Institute of Technology , Durgapur , West Bengal , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160908,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Curcumin/*chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fanconi Anemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Systems Biology']",,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2016.1225309 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2017 Jun;37(3):276-282. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2016.1225309.

Understanding of the mechanisms regulating the transcription of c-myb gene is challenging as it lacks a typical promoter and multiple factors are involved. Our previous studies identified some distal regulatory elements in the upstream regions of c-myb gene in murine myeloid progenitor M1 cells, but the detailed mechanisms still remain unclear. In the present study, we found that a cell differentiation-related DNase1 hypersensitive site is located at a -28k region upstream of c-myb gene and that transcription factors Hoxa9, Meis1 and PU.1 bind to the -28k region. Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) assay confirmed the interaction between the -28k region and the c-myb promoter, which is supported by the enrichment of CTCF and Cohesin. Our analysis also points to a critical role for Hoxa9 and PU.1 in distal regulation of c-myb expression in murine myeloid cells and cell differentiation. Overexpression of Hoxa9 disrupted the IL-6-induced differentiation of M1 cells and upregulated c-myb expression through binding of the -28k region. Taken together, our results provide an evidence for critical role of the -28k region in distal regulatory mechanism for c-myb gene expression during differentiation of myeloid progenitor M1 cells.","['Zhang, Junfang', 'Han, Bingshe', 'Li, Xiaoxia', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Jiang, Penglei', 'Koller, Richard P', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Zhang J', 'Han B', 'Li X', 'Bies J', 'Jiang P', 'Koller RP', 'Wolff L']","['Key Laboratory of Aquacultural Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Education, College of Fishery and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, No.999 Huchenghuan Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai 201306, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Aquacultural Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Education, College of Fishery and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, No.999 Huchenghuan Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai 201306, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Aquacultural Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Education, College of Fishery and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, No.999 Huchenghuan Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai 201306, China.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Aquacultural Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Education, College of Fishery and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, No.999 Huchenghuan Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai 201306, China.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160908,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/immunology', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/genetics/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/immunology']",PMC5059869,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016267 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.267 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Sep 8;7(9):e2364. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.267.,,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Ctcf protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cohesins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (interleukin-6, mouse)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is hypothesized to be important for the maintenance of AML as well as contribute to chemotherapy response. Here we employ a mouse model of AML expressing the fusion oncogene MLL-AF9 and explore the effects of Atg5 deletion, a key autophagy protein, on the malignant transformation and progression of AML. Consistent with a transient decrease in colony-forming potential in vitro, the in vivo deletion of Atg5 in MLL-AF9-transduced bone marrow cells during primary transplantation prolonged the survival of recipient mice, suggesting that autophagy has a role in MLL-AF9-driven leukemia initiation. In contrast, deletion of Atg5 in malignant AML cells during secondary transplantation did not influence the survival or chemotherapeutic response of leukemic mice. Interestingly, autophagy was found to be involved in the survival of differentiated myeloid cells originating from MLL-AF9-driven LSCs. Taken together, our data suggest that Atg5-dependent autophagy may contribute to the development but not chemotherapy sensitivity of murine AML induced by MLL-AF9.","['Liu, Qiang', 'Chen, Longgui', 'Atkinson, Jennifer M', 'Claxton, David F', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Liu Q', 'Chen L', 'Atkinson JM', 'Claxton DF', 'Wang HG']","['Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160908,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*immunology', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Lysosomes/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC5059867,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016264 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.264 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Sep 8;7(9):e2361. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.264.,['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Atg5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HO-1 mRNA levels in 83 patients were measured using qRT-PCR. In a comparative analysis of HO-1 levels in relation to different post-transplant outcomes, the HO-1 threshold, determined via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was effectively used to predict clinical relapse and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). The correlations among clinical relapse, aGVHD and HO-1 expression were analyzed based on this threshold. RESULTS: Leukemia risk stratification and relative expression of HO-1 before pretreatment had significant effects on clinical relapse. Leukemia risk stratification, relative expression of HO-1 after HSCT and the interval from diagnosis to transplantation had a significant influence on aGVHD. Both relapse and aGVHD appeared to be associated with relative HO-1 expression. The relative expression rate of HO-1 was 1.131-1.186 before pretreatment, and strongly associated with post-transplantation relapse. The relative expression rate of HO-1 was 1.102-1.144 after transplantation, and closely related to aGVHD. ROC curve analysis revealed high specificity and sensitivity of HO-1 expression in predicting relapse and aGVHD after allo-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: HO-1 expression can be effectively used as a predictor of relapse as well as a diagnostic factor of aGVHD after transplantation for allo-HSCT patients with acute leukemia.","['Lu, Yinghao', 'Wu, Depei', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Li, Yan', 'Ma, Dan', 'Chai, Xiao', 'Kang, Qian']","['Lu Y', 'Wu D', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Ma D', 'Chai X', 'Kang Q']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis under Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['000447852 [pii]', '10.1159/000447852 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2016;39(4):1495-502. doi: 10.1159/000447852.

A key policy question is whether new anticancer drugs offer value, given their high cost. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we assessed the value of new cancer treatments in routine clinical practice for patients with metastatic breast, lung, or kidney cancer or chronic myeloid leukemia in the periods 1996-2000 and 2007-11. We found that there were large increases in medical costs, but also large gains in life expectancy. For example, among patients with breast cancer who received physician-administered drugs, lifetime costs-including costs for outpatient and inpatient care-increased by $72,000 and life expectancy increased by thirteen months. Changes in life expectancy and costs were much smaller among patients who did not receive these drugs.","['Howard, David H', 'Chernew, Michael E', 'Abdelgawad, Tamer', 'Smith, Gregory L', 'Sollano, Josephine', 'Grabowski, David C']","['Howard DH', 'Chernew ME', 'Abdelgawad T', 'Smith GL', 'Sollano J', 'Grabowski DC']","['David H.

Disease relapse is common upon therapy cessation, even in patients with complete molecular responses. Furthermore, once CML progresses to blast crisis (BC), treatment outcomes are dismal. We hypothesized that concomitant targeting of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase could overcome these limitations. We demonstrate increased BCL-2 expression at the protein level in bone marrow cells, particularly in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) cells of inducible CML in mice, as determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. Further, selective inhibition of BCL-2, aided by TKI-mediated MCL-1 and BCL-XL inhibition, markedly decreased leukemic Lin(-)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) cell numbers and long-term stem cell frequency and prolonged survival in a murine CML model. Additionally, this combination effectively eradicated CD34(+)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD38(+), and quiescent stem/progenitor CD34(+) cells from BC CML patient samples. Our results suggest that BCL-2 is a key survival factor for CML stem/progenitor cells and that combined inhibition of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has the potential to significantly improve depth of response and cure rates of chronic-phase and BC CML.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Mu, Hong', 'Zhou, Hongsheng', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Schober, Wendy', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak PY', 'Mu H', 'Zhou H', 'Mak DH', 'Schober W', 'Leverson JD', 'Zhang B', 'Bhatia R', 'Huang X', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. bicarter@mdanderson.org mandreef@mdanderson.org.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. bicarter@mdanderson.org mandreef@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC5111086,"['Joel Leverson is an employee of AbbVie Inc, which developed ABT-199.

In addition, a favorable impact of antiviral treatment on overall survival of patients with HCV-related lymphoma has been reported. Data on IFN-free regimens combining direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in HCV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders are scanty. We analyzed the virological and lymphoproliferative disease response (LDR) of 46 patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic HCV infection treated with DAAs. The histological distribution was 37 marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), 2 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, 2 follicular lymphomas, 4 CLL/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLLs), and 1 low-grade NHL not otherwise specified. Thirty-nine patients received a sofosbuvir-based regimen and 7 patients received other DAAs. The median duration of DAA therapy was 12 weeks (range, 6-24 weeks). A sustained virological response at week 12 after finishing DAAs was obtained in 45 patients (98%); the overall LDR rate was 67%, including 12 patients (26%) who achieved a complete response. The LDR rate was 73% among patients with MZL, whereas no response was observed in CLL/SLL patients. Seven patients cleared cryoglobulins out of 15 who were initially positive.

However, despite this prominence, our understanding of the function of miRNAs in the early hematopoietic stages is incomplete. In this study, we found that miR-139-5p negatively regulated the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells and that downregulation of miR-139-5p expression was associated with hematopoietic malignancy, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Knockdown of miR-139-5p resulted in myeloid-biased differentiation with expansion of myeloid progenitor cells. In contrast, miR-139-5p expression inhibited the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors and resulted in the remission of a CML-like disease that is induced by breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) transformation. We also found that Brg1 is a functional target of miR-139-5p and that Brg1 is involved in BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis. Thus, our results identify miR-139-5p as a key regulator of cellular proliferation during early hematopoiesis and suggest that it is a potent antileukemic molecule.","['Choi, Jinwook', 'Kim, Young-Kook', 'Park, Kyungsoo', 'Nah, Jinwoo', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Kim, V Narry', 'Seong, Rho Hyun']","['Choi J', 'Kim YK', 'Park K', 'Nah J', 'Yoon SS', 'Kim DW', 'Kim VN', 'Seong RH']","['School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; and.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, and.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160907,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/10/30 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31756-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-02-702464 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 27;128(17):2117-2129. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-702464.

OBJECTIVE: Characterization of global haemostatic phenotypes of patients with ALL during Asp therapy. PROCEDURE: Thrombin generation (TG) was monitored in platelet-poor plasma of 56 children treated for a B lineage ALL (36 with native, 20 with PEG Asp) using 1 pM tissue factor and 4 muM phospholipids, with and without thrombomodulin. Protein C activity (PC), free protein S (PS), antithrombin (AT) and fibrinogen levels were also measured. RESULTS: Elevated endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak of TG were noted at diagnosis, throughout the Induction phase and Late Intensification but was significantly less for PEG than for native Asp (P < 0.001), while age, sex, type of corticosteroid during Induction and molecular response had no significant effect. The reduction of ETP after addition of thrombomodulin was significantly lower in ALL children compared with that in controls, suggesting impairment in PS/PC pathway. Three patients experienced thrombosis: two treated with native and one with PEG Asp. The two patients with native Asp had, at the time of thrombosis, a prothrombotic profile. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Asp, in combination with CS, enhances TG in children with ALL, more significantly with native than PEG Asp, which is present early at diagnosis, persists during Induction and reappears during Late Intensification. This is consistent with the high incidence of thrombotic events described during these phases of therapy. The less pronounced effect of PEG Asp remains to be elucidated.","['Rozen, Laurence', 'Noubouossie, Denis', 'Dedeken, Laurence', 'Huybrechts, Sophie', 'Le, Phu Quoc', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Demulder, Anne']","['Rozen L', 'Noubouossie D', 'Dedeken L', 'Huybrechts S', 'Le PQ', 'Ferster A', 'Demulder A']","['Laboratory of hematology, CHU Brugmann, LHUB-ULB, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of hematology, CHU Brugmann, LHUB-ULB, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of hematology, CHU Brugmann, LHUB-ULB, ULB Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160908,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced/*diagnosis/metabolism']",,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26228 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Feb;64(2):294-301. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26228.

However, the molecular basis of PML/RARalpha-mediated transcriptional control during ATRA-induced differentiation is unclear. Previous studies have shown that the PML/RARalpha fusion protein behaves as a type II nuclear receptor, binding to DNA regardless of ligand status. Here, we performed a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments, demonstrating that there is an additional mode of action of PML/RARalpha, wherein PML/RARalpha does not bind DNA in the absence of ATRA but binds DNA and activates adjacent genes in the presence of ATRA. This mode of action is similar to that of a type I nuclear receptor and is highlighted by activation of G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) during ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation of leukemia cell lines (NB4 and PR9) and primary human APL cells. C/EBPepsilon occupancy of the G0S2 promoter was elevated in parallel with recruitment of PML/RARalpha in ATRA-treated NB4, PR9, and primary APL cells. Furthermore, we verified that the p30 isoform of C/EBPepsilon is crucial for activation of G0S2 and that PML/RARalpha interacts physically and cooperates functionally with C/EBPepsilon to up-regulate G0S2 Our data not only demonstrate a new mode of action of PML/RARalpha but also suggest a novel model in which PML/RARalpha synergizes with C/EBPepsilon to reactivate the C/EBPepsilon target G0S2, thereby contributing to ATRA-mediated APL differentiation and potentially, clinical remission.","['Zhang, Fang', 'Zhu, Yong Lan', 'Deng, Wang Long', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Zhang F', 'Zhu YL', 'Deng WL', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and hematology_sjtu@163.com jizhang@sibs.ac.cn.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Graduate School, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160907,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1A0316-116R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1A0316-116R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Mar;101(3):655-664. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1A0316-116R.

Superparamagnetic particles or ferromagnetic liquids are added to the droplets to provide a ""handle"" by which the magnet can exert a force on the droplet. In this study, we present a novel method of magnetic manipulation, where droplets instead contain paramagnetic salts with molar magnetic susceptibilities (chim) approximately approximately 10 000x < that for superparamagnetic particles. Droplet actuation is facilitated by low surface friction on fluorous silica nanoparticle-based superhydrophobic coatings, where <2 muN is required for reproducible droplet actuation. Different paramagnetic salts with chim from approximately 4500 to 72000 (x 10(-6) cm(3) mol(-1)) were used to make aqueous solutions of different concentration and tested for droplet actuation and sliding angle using permanent magnets (1.8-2.1 kG). Paramagnetic salts are compared in terms of solubility, minimum required concentration, and maximum droplet velocity before disengagement. There is a strong correlation between the magnetic susceptibility of the salt solution, its concentration, and ease of actuation. As an application example, droplets containing a paramagnetic salt and doxorubicin (leukemia drug) are magnetically actuated and interrogated using laser-induced fluorescence. Signal attenuation due to the MnCl2 salt was examined, and the Stern-Volmer quenching constant was determined.","['Mats, Lili', 'Logue, Fiona', 'Oleschuk, Richard D']","['Mats L', 'Logue F', 'Oleschuk RD']","[""Department of Chemistry, Queen's University , 90 Bader Lane, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada."", ""Department of Chemistry, Queen's University , 90 Bader Lane, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada."", ""Department of Chemistry, Queen's University , 90 Bader Lane, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160922,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,,,,2016/09/09 06:00,2016/09/09 06:01,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/09 06:01 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01917 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2016 Oct 4;88(19):9486-9494. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01917.

The ETS-related gene (ERG), an important regulator of normal haematopoiesis, is also highly expressed in T-ALL and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, the transcriptional regulation of ERG in leukaemic cells remains poorly understood. In order to discover transcriptional regulators of ERG, we employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based method to identify factors binding the 321 bp ERG +85 stem cell enhancer region in MOLT-4 T-ALL and KG-1 AML cells. Using this approach, we identified a number of known binders of the +85 enhancer in leukaemic cells along with previously unknown binders, including ETV6 and IKZF1. We confirmed that ETV6 and IKZF1 were also bound at the +85 enhancer in both leukaemic cells and in healthy human CD34(+) haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Knockdown experiments confirmed that ETV6 and IKZF1 are transcriptional regulators not just of ERG, but also of a number of genes regulated by a densely interconnected network of seven transcription factors. At last, we show that ETV6 and IKZF1 expression levels are positively correlated with expression of a number of heptad genes in AML and high expression of all nine genes confers poorer overall prognosis.","['Unnikrishnan, Ashwin', 'Guan, Yi F', 'Huang, Yizhou', 'Beck, Dominik', 'Thoms, Julie A I', 'Peirs, Sofie', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Ma, Shiyong', 'de Walle, Inge V', 'de Jong, Ineke', 'Ali, Zara', 'Zhong, Ling', 'Raftery, Mark J', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Larsson, Jonas', 'MacKenzie, Karen L', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Wong, Jason W H', 'Pimanda, John E']","['Unnikrishnan A', 'Guan YF', 'Huang Y', 'Beck D', 'Thoms JA', 'Peirs S', 'Knezevic K', 'Ma S', 'de Walle IV', 'de Jong I', 'Ali Z', 'Zhong L', 'Raftery MJ', 'Taghon T', 'Larsson J', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Wong JW', 'Pimanda JE']","['Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia Ashwin.unnikrishnan@unsw.edu.au.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Centre for Health Technologies and the School of Software, University of Technology, Sydney, 2007, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, 2052 Australia."", 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden.', ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, 2052 Australia."", 'Centre for Health Technologies and the School of Software, University of Technology, Sydney, 2007, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia Jason.wong@unsw.edu.au.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Prince of Wales Clinical School, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia jpimanda@unsw.edu.au.', 'Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, 2031, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160906,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/physiology']",PMC5159545,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['gkw804 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkw804 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Dec 15;44(22):10644-10661. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw804.

To study their role in such disorders, we generated knock-in mice with hematopoietic-specific expression of Sf3b1-K700E, the commonest type of SF3B1 mutation in MDS. Sf3b1(K700E/+) animals had impaired erythropoiesis and progressive anemia without ringed sideroblasts, as well as reduced hematopoietic stem cell numbers and host-repopulating fitness. To understand the molecular basis of these observations, we analyzed global RNA splicing in Sf3b1(K700E/+) hematopoietic cells. Aberrant splicing was associated with the usage of cryptic 3' splice and branchpoint sites, as described for human SF3B1 mutants. However, we found a little overlap between aberrantly spliced mRNAs in mouse versus human, suggesting that anemia may be a consequence of globally disrupted splicing. Furthermore, the murine orthologues of genes associated with ring sideroblasts in human MDS, including Abcb7 and Tmem14c, were not aberrantly spliced in Sf3b1(K700E/+) mice. Our findings demonstrate that, despite significant differences in affected transcripts, there is overlap in the phenotypes associated with SF3B1-K700E between human and mouse. Future studies should focus on understanding the basis of these similarities and differences as a means of deciphering the consequences of spliceosome gene mutations in MDS.","['Mupo, A', 'Seiler, M', 'Sathiaseelan, V', 'Pance, A', 'Yang, Y', 'Agrawal, A A', 'Iorio, F', 'Bautista, R', 'Pacharne, S', 'Tzelepis, K', 'Manes, N', 'Wright, P', 'Papaemmanuil, E', 'Kent, D G', 'Campbell, P C', 'Buonamici, S', 'Bolli, N', 'Vassiliou, G S']","['Mupo A', 'Seiler M', 'Sathiaseelan V', 'Pance A', 'Yang Y', 'Agrawal AA', 'Iorio F', 'Bautista R', 'Pacharne S', 'Tzelepis K', 'Manes N', 'Wright P', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Kent DG', 'Campbell PC', 'Buonamici S', 'Bolli N', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Malaria Programme, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'European Bioinformatics, Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'LIMS Compute and Infrastructure, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', ""Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Onco-Ematologia, Universita' degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy."", 'Dipartimento di Ematologia ed Onco-Ematologia Pediatrica, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160908,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Anemia, Sideroblastic/*etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5336192,,2016/10/22 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016251 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):720-727. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.251.

Butyrolactone I (BL-I), one of the major secondary metabolites of fungus Aspergillus terreus, is a selective cdc2 kinase inhibitor. In the present study, the metabolism of BL-I in male Wistar rats was investigated by characterizing metabolites excreted into feces. 2. Following an oral dose of 40 mg/kg BL-I, 10 phase I metabolites were isolated from the feces of rats, and their structures were identified on the basis of a range of spectroscopic data and ICD analysis. These metabolites were fully characterized as butyrolactone VI (M1), aspernolide E (M2), 7''S-hydroxy-9''-ene-butyrolactone I (M3), 7''R-hydroxy-9''-ene-butyrolactone I (M4), 7''S, 8''R-dihydroxy-aspernolide E (M5), 7''R, 8''S-dihydroxy-aspernolide E (M6), 7''R-acetyl-8''S-hydroxy-aspernolide E (M7), 7''S-acetyl-8''R-hydroxy-aspernolide E (M8), 7''R-methoxy-8''S-hydroxy-aspernolide E (M9), butyrolactone V (M10), respectively. It is the first time to describe the metabolites of BL-I in vivo, and metabolites M3 to M9 are new compounds. 3. BL-I and metabolites M2 to M10 were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and in vitro antiproliferative activities. Only M-3 and M-4 showed inhibitory effect against staphylococcus aureus both with MIC of 125 mug/ml. BL-I and metabolites M-4 and M-5 exhibited potent cancer cell growth inhibitory activities against HL-60 (human leukemia) cell lines with the IC50 values of 13.2, 28.8 and 35.7 muM, respectively. 4. On the basis of metabolites profile, a possible metabolism pathway for BL-I in rats has been proposed.

Small-molecule PI3K inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials; however, intrinsic and acquired resistance limits their utility. We used a systematic gain-of-function approach to identify genes whose upregulation confers resistance to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 in breast cancer cells. Among the validated resistance genes, Proviral Insertion site in Murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases conferred resistance by maintaining downstream PI3K effector activation in an AKT-independent manner. Concurrent pharmacologic inhibition of PIM and PI3K overcame this resistance mechanism. We also observed increased PIM expression and activity in a subset of breast cancer biopsies with clinical resistance to PI3K inhibitors. PIM1 overexpression was mutually exclusive with PIK3CA mutation in treatment-naive breast cancers, suggesting downstream functional redundancy. Together, these results offer new insights into resistance to PI3K inhibitors and support clinical studies of combined PIM/PI3K inhibition in a subset of PIK3CA-mutant cancers.

Leukemia stem cells (LSC) are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of AML due to their stem-cell properties. Differentiation therapies aim to abrogate the self-renewal capacity and diminish blast lifespan. METHODS: An in silico screening was designed to search for FDA-approved small molecules that potentially induce differentiation of AML cells. Bromocriptine was identified and validated in an in vitro screening. Bromocriptine is an approved drug originally indicated for Parkinson's disease, acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhoea, and recently repositioned for diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Treatment with bromocriptine reduced cell viability of AML cells by activation of the apoptosis program and induction of myeloid differentiation. Moreover, the LSC-enriched primitive AML cell fraction was more sensitive to the presence of bromocriptine. In fact, bromocriptine decreased the clonogenic capacity of AML cells. Interestingly, a negligible effect is observed in healthy blood cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of bromocriptine as an anti-AML drug in a repositioning setting and the further clinical validation of this preclinical study.","['Lara-Castillo, Maria Carmen', 'Cornet-Masana, Josep Maria', 'Etxabe, Amaia', 'Banus-Mulet, Antonia', 'Torrente, Miguel Angel', 'Nomdedeu, Meritxell', 'Diaz-Beya, Marina', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Risueno, Ruth M']","['Lara-Castillo MC', 'Cornet-Masana JM', 'Etxabe A', 'Banus-Mulet A', 'Torrente MA', 'Nomdedeu M', 'Diaz-Beya M', 'Esteve J', 'Risueno RM']","['Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Esther Koplowitz, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic-University of Barcelona, Rossello 149-153, 08036, Barcelona, Spain. risueno@carrerasresearch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160907,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Adult', 'Bromocriptine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",PMC5015257,,2016/09/09 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/09/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-016-1007-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-1007-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 Sep 7;14:261. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-1007-5.,,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '3A64E3G5ZO (Bromocriptine)']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4048-9536'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Bromocriptine', '*Drug repositioning', '*Leukemia stem cells', '*New drug']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No attempts to investigate whether B-cell Sags are able to induce the apoptosis of cognate malignant B cells were reported. In the present study we show that protein L (PpL), secreted by Finegoldia magna, a B-cell Sag which interacts with kappa+ bearing cells, induces the apoptosis of murine and human kappa+ lymphoma B cells both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis was not altered by caspase-8 inhibitor. No alterations in the levels of Bid, Fas and Fas-L were found suggesting that PpL does not activate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The involvement of the intrinsic pathway was clearly indicated by: i) alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) both in murine and human lymphoma cells exposed to PpL; ii) decreased levels of apoptosis in the presence of caspase-9 inhibitor; iii) significant increases of Bim and Bax protein levels and downregulation of Bcl-2; iv) the translocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria of Bax and Bim pro-apoptotic proteins and its inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor but not by caspase-8 inhibitor and v) the translocation of Bcl-2 protein from the mitochondria to the cytosol and its inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor but not by caspase-8 inhibitor.

Tumor cells frequently express antigens whose expression is typically restricted to germ cells. Their unique expression pattern is guaranteed by precise epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Because of their tumor-limited, high immunogenicity, and biased expression, discovery of these molecules provides unprecedented opportunities for further research and clinical development in the field of cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy. Evolving evidence reveals that a number of CTAs stimulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and generation of cancer stem-like cells, intensifying metastasis, invasion, and tumorigenesis. Based on these features, CTAs attract attention to be considered as ideal targets for developing several clinical trials, many of them concentrating on CTA vaccine therapy. According to recent practical clinical interest, more characterizations of CTA regulation are identified. CTA expression has been demonstrated in a variety of human cancer tissues, and some of them have been found to elicit humoral and/or cellular immune responses in cancer patients. CTAs are brilliant targets for anticancer drug discovery, targeted tumor therapy, and diagnostic biomarkers, furthermore, valued genes in the study of immunotherapy, promoting tumorigenesis, and malignant progression. This review outlines and categorizes our current understanding of the complex and biased process of CTAs mRNA and protein expression in cancer, and supplies the most recent information on their regulation and function. Besides, a concise synopsis of the major clinical trials involving CTAs, as therapeutic avenues, is discussed.

Exposure to other chemicals has been inconsistently associated with hematologic malignancies. We evaluated occupational and residential chemical exposures as risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) using population-based data. AML and MDS cases were identified by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System. Controls were identified through the Minnesota driver's license/identification card list. Chemical exposures were measured by self-report. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 265 MDS cases, 420 AML cases and 1388 controls. We observed significant associations between both MDS and AML and benzene (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.19, 2.63 and OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.35, 3.28, respectively) and vinyl chlorides (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.15, 3.63 and OR = 2.81, 95% CI 1.14, 6.92). Exposure to soot, creosote, inks, dyes and tanning solutions and coal dust were associated with AML (range ORs = 2.68-4.03), while no association was seen between these exposures and MDS (range ORs = 0.57-1.68).

METHODS: Adult CML patients initiated on first-line dasatinib or nilotinib in 2010-2014 were identified from two large US administrative claims databases. Treatment patterns, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) adherence and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs were measured from the 1st-line TKI initiation (index date) to the end of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 604 and 418 patients were included in the dasatinib and nilotinib cohorts (mean ages = 50.9 and 52.5 years, 46.4% and 45.7% female), respectively. Among the dasatinib patients, 91% started with 100 mg/day, 3% with <100 mg/day, and 6% with >100 mg/day. Among the nilotinib patients, 76% started with 600 mg/day, 16% with >600 mg/day, and 8% <600 mg/day. The dasatinib cohort had a higher hazard of dose decrease (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.66; p = .002) and of switching to another TKI (HR =1.62; p = .019) compared to the nilotinib cohort. The hazard of dose increase (HR =0.76; p = .423) and treatment discontinuation (HR =1.10; p = .372) were not significantly different between cohorts. There was also no significant difference in TKI adherence levels (mean proportion of days covered [PDC] difference over first 6 months = -0.0003, p = .981; mean PDC difference over first 12 months = -0.0022, p = .880) and HRU (inpatient day incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.03, p = .930; emergency room IRR =1.26, p = .197; and days with outpatient services IRR = 1.01, p = .842). The dasatinib cohort incurred higher healthcare costs by $749 per patient per month (p = .044) compared to the nilotinib cohort. LIMITATION: Information on CML phase and Sokal score was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib was associated with an increased hazard of dose decrease and switching to another TKI and higher healthcare costs, vs nilotinib.","['Latremouille-Viau, Dominick', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Nitulescu, Roy', 'Gagnon, Patrick S', 'Joseph, George J', 'Chen, Lei']","['Latremouille-Viau D', 'Guerin A', 'Nitulescu R', 'Gagnon PS', 'Joseph GJ', 'Chen L']","['a Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , QC , Canada.', 'a Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , QC , Canada.', 'a Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , QC , Canada.', 'a Analysis Group, Inc. , Montreal , QC , Canada.', 'b Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.', 'b Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dasatinib/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'United States']",,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2016.1225578 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2017 Jan;20(1):63-71. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2016.1225578.

In parallel, there is also accumulating evidence that several molecular subtypes of cancer are highly dependent on splicing function for cell survival. These findings have resulted in a growing interest in targeting splicing catalysis, splicing regulatory proteins, and/or specific key altered splicing events in the treatment of cancer. Here we present strategies that exist and that are in development to target altered dependency on the spliceosome, as well as aberrant splicing, in cancer. These include drugs to target global splicing in cancer subtypes that are preferentially dependent on wild-type splicing for survival, methods to alter post-translational modifications of splicing-regulating proteins, and strategies to modulate pathologic splicing events and protein-RNA interactions in cancer.","['Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Lee SC', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics']",PMC5644489,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.4165 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.4165 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2016 Sep 7;22(9):976-86. doi: 10.1038/nm.4165.,"['K08 CA160647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (RNA Splicing Factors)'],['NIHMS897081'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From our analysis, it appears that MCS can occur at any age. It can manifest de novo or, to a lesser extent, may evolve from a previously established mastocytosis. Bone tumor is a frequent manifestation, and symptoms of mast cell activation are rare. Histological diagnosis can be difficult because MCS is frequently composed of highly atypical neoplastic mast cells and can thus mimic other tumors. Unexpectedly, the canonical KIT D816V mutation is found in only 21% of MCS; therefore, complete KIT gene sequencing is required. The prognosis of patients with MCS is poor, with a median survival time of less than 18 months, and progression to mast cell leukemia is not unusual.

Using an integrative approach combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we molecularly characterized 30 pediatric T-ALLs and identified common recurrent T-ALL targets such as FBXW7, JAK1, JAK3, PHF6, KDM6A and NOTCH1 as well as novel candidate T-ALL driver mutations including the p.R35L missense mutation in splicesome factor U2AF1 found in 3 patients and loss of function mutations in the X-linked tumor suppressor genes MED12 (frameshit mutation p.V167fs, splice site mutation g.chrX:70339329T>C, missense mutation p.R1989H) and USP9X (nonsense mutation p.Q117*). In vitro functional studies further supported the putative role of these novel T-ALL genes in driving transformation. U2AF1 p.R35L was shown to induce aberrant splicing of downstream target genes, and shRNA knockdown of MED12 and USP9X was shown to confer resistance to apoptosis following T-ALL relevant chemotherapy drug treatment in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, nearly 60% of novel candidate driver events were identified among immature T-ALL cases, highlighting the underlying genomic complexity of pediatric T-ALL, and the need for larger integrative studies to decipher the mechanisms that contribute to its various subtypes and provide opportunities to refine patient stratification and treatment.","['Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Cassart, Pauline', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Saillour, Virginie', 'Ouimet, Manon', 'Langlois, Sylvie', 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Sontag, Thomas', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Spinella JF', 'Cassart P', 'Richer C', 'Saillour V', 'Ouimet M', 'Langlois S', 'St-Onge P', 'Sontag T', 'Healy J', 'Minden MD', 'Sinnett D']","['CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Codon, Nonsense/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genome', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mediator Complex/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Splicing Factor U2AF/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics']",PMC5323170,,2016/09/08 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['11796 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11796 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 4;7(40):65485-65503. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11796.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (Fbxw7 protein, mouse)', '0 (MED12 protein, human)', '0 (Mediator Complex)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MED12', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'U2AF1', 'USP9X', 'X-linked tumor suppressor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, a potent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is able to counteract pro-survival signals in CLL cells. Since the effects on CLL cells have been studied in the last years, less is known about the influence of ibrutinib on NLCs properties. We sought to determine how ibrutinib modifies NLCs functions focusing on the balance between immunosuppressive and inflammatory features. Our data show that ibrutinib targets BTK expressed by NLCs modifying their phenotype and function. Treatment with ibrutinib reduces the phagocytic ability and increases the immunosuppressive profile of NLCs exacerbating the expression of M2 markers. Accordingly, ibrutinib hampers LPS-mediated signaling, decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation, while allows IL-4-mediated STAT6 phosphorylation. In addition, NLCs treated with ibrutinib are able to protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis partially through the secretion of IL-10. Results from patient samples obtained prior and after 1 month of treatment with ibrutinib show an accentuation of CD206, CD11b and Tie2 in the monocytic population in the peripheral blood. Our study provides new insights into the immunomodulatory action of ibrutinib on monocyte/macrophage population in CLL.","['Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Audrito, Valentina', 'Martinelli, Silvia', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Zucchini, Patrizia', 'Grisendi, Giulia', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Marasca, Roberto']","['Fiorcari S', 'Maffei R', 'Audrito V', 'Martinelli S', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Zucchini P', 'Grisendi G', 'Potenza L', 'Luppi M', 'Burger JA', 'Deaglio S', 'Marasca R']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin and Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin and Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5323207,,2016/09/08 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['11782 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11782 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 4;7(40):65968-65981. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11782.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'ibrutinib', 'immune modulation', 'microenvironment', 'nurse-like cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are needed to inform the choice among various alternative donor-cell sources. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we compared outcomes in 582 consecutive patients with acute leukemia or the myelodysplastic syndrome who received a first myeloablative hematopoietic-cell transplant from an unrelated cord-blood donor (140 patients), an HLA-matched unrelated donor (344), or an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (98). RESULTS: The relative risks of death and relapse between the cord-blood group and the two other unrelated-donor groups appeared to vary according to the presence of minimal residual disease status before transplantation. Among patients with minimal residual disease, the risk of death was higher in the HLA-mismatched group than in the cord-blood group (hazard ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52 to 5.63; P=0.001); the risk was also higher in the HLA-matched group than in the cord-blood group but not significantly so (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.94 to 3.02; P=0.08). Among patients without minimal residual disease, the hazard ratios were lower (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.46; P=0.30; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.28; P=0.33). The risk of relapse among patients with minimal residual disease was significantly higher in the two unrelated-donor groups than in the cord-blood group (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.22 to 7.38; P=0.02; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.34 to 6.35; P=0.007). Among patients without minimal residual disease, the magnitude of these associations was lower (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.51 to 3.25; P=0.60; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.65 to 2.58; P=0.46). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that among patients with pretransplantation minimal residual disease, the probability of overall survival after receipt of a transplant from a cord-blood donor was at least as favorable as that after receipt of a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor and was significantly higher than the probability after receipt of a transplant from an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor. Furthermore, the probability of relapse was lower in the cord-blood group than in either of the other groups.","['Milano, Filippo', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Wood, Brent', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Flowers, Mary E', 'Doney, Kristine', 'Witherspoon, Robert', 'Mielcarek, Marco', 'Deeg, Joachim H', 'Sorror, Mohamed', 'Dahlberg, Ann', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Salit, Rachel', 'Petersdorf, Effie', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Delaney, Colleen']","['Milano F', 'Gooley T', 'Wood B', 'Woolfrey A', 'Flowers ME', 'Doney K', 'Witherspoon R', 'Mielcarek M', 'Deeg JH', 'Sorror M', 'Dahlberg A', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Salit R', 'Petersdorf E', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Delaney C']","['From the Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (F.M., T.G., A.W., M.E.F., K.D., R.W., M.M., J.H.D., M.S., A.D., B.M.S., R.S., E.P., F.R.A., C.D.), and the Departments of Medicine (F.M., B.W., M.E.F., M.M., J.H.D., M.S., B.M.S., R.S., E.P., F.R.A.) and Pediatrics (A.W., A.D., C.D.), University of Washington -

Furthermore, after human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was stimulated with cagA-positive standard strains (cagA+ H. pylori 26695), the expression of periodontitis-related molecules Wnt5a, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) significantly increased (p < 0.05). Conversely, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was almost stable. Meanwhile, cagA+ H. pylori promoted significantly higher expression of IL-8 and Wnt5a than isogenic cagA mutants strains (cagA- H. pylori 26695) did. Taken together, our data suggested that H. pylori might promote the growth of some periodontal pathogens and aggravate the progress of chronic periodontitis.","['Hu, Zhekai', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Yu, Yuedi', 'Kang, Wenyan', 'Han, Yingnan', 'Geng, Xiwen', 'Ge, Shaohua', 'Sun, Yundong']","['Hu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Z', 'Yu Y', 'Kang W', 'Han Y', 'Geng X', 'Ge S', 'Sun Y']","[""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Southwest Weiyu Middle School, Shanghai 200233, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Oral Tumor Biology, Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology Ninth People Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200011, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Periodontology, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Periodontology, School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology, Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chronic Periodontitis/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Helicobacter Infections/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Helicobacter pylori/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Periodontal Attachment Loss/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Prevotella intermedia/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Treponema denticola/isolation & purification/physiology']",PMC5341831,,2016/09/08 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['11449 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11449 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 11;7(41):66700-66712. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11449.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-8', 'Wnt5a', 'chronic periodontitis', 'inflammation', 'Helicobacter pylori']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its significance in relapsed/refractory ALL is less clear. METHODS: This study identified 78 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL who achieved a morphologic response with inotuzumab ozogamicin (n = 41), blinatumomab (n = 11), or mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin plus inotuzumab (n = 26) during either salvage 1 (S1; n = 46) or salvage 2 (S2; n = 32) and had undergone an MRD assessment by multiparameter flow cytometry at the time of remission. RESULTS: MRD negativity was achieved in 41 patients overall (53%). The MRD negativity rate was 57% in S1 and 47% in S2. Among patients in S1, achieving MRD negativity was associated with longer event-free survival (EFS; median, 18 vs 7 months; 2-year EFS rate, 46% vs 17%; P = .06) and overall survival (OS; median, 27 vs 9 months; 2-year OS, 52% vs 36%; P = .15). EFS and OS were similar in S2, regardless of the MRD response. Among MRD-negative patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), EFS and OS were superior for those who underwent SCT in S1 rather than S2 (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). Patients in S1 who achieved MRD negativity and subsequently underwent SCT had the best outcomes with a 2-year OS rate of 65%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve MRD negativity in S1 can have long-term survival. Patients in S2 generally have poor outcomes, regardless of their MRD status.

In the C. elegans germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.","['Seelk, Stefanie', 'Adrian-Kalchhauser, Irene', 'Hargitai, Balazs', 'Hajduskova, Martina', 'Gutnik, Silvia', 'Tursun, Baris', 'Ciosk, Rafal']","['Seelk S', 'Adrian-Kalchhauser I', 'Hargitai B', 'Hajduskova M', 'Gutnik S', 'Tursun B', 'Ciosk R']","['Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,,,PMC5045294,['The authors declare that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/08 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7554/eLife.15477 [doi]'],epublish,Elife. 2016 Sep 7;5. doi: 10.7554/eLife.15477.,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7293-8629', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2234-6216']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['C. elegans', 'Notch', 'PRC2', 'T-ALL', 'developmental biology', 'germ cell', 'glp-1', 'leukemia', 'mes-2', 'mes-3', 'mes-6', 'reprograming', 'stem cell', 'stem cells', 'utx-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particular interest has focused on miRNA-124 expression, which is inhibited in MDS and has recently been demonstrated to be upregulated in response to epigenetic treatment (EGT). Previous studies have determined the in vitro and in vivo expression of miRNA-124 and several molecular targets, including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK6 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the miRNA-124-mediated therapeutic response to EGT in MDS and identify additional potential biomarkers of early EGT treatment response in myeloid malignancies. In vitro studies in the HL60 leukemic cell line identified upregulation of miRNA-124 expression in response to single-agent EGT with either azacytidine (AZA) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589). Combination EGT with AZA and LBH589 resulted in significant additive induction of miRNA-124 expression. Expression of downstream targets of miRNA-124, including CDK4, CDK6 and EZH2, in response to single agent and combined EGT was determined in HL60 cells. Single and combination EGT treatment resulted in inhibition of CDK4, CDK6 and EZH2 expression with combination EGT resulting in a significant and additive inhibitory effect. In vivo studies using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients receiving combination EGT for high risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia demonstrated significant induction of miRNA-124 and inhibition CDK4 and CDK6 messenger (m)RNA expression in patients that responded to combination EGT. A trend to inhibited EZH2 mRNA expression was also identified in response to combination EGT. Overall, the present observations identify a potential molecular mechanism for miRNA-124-mediated response to EGT involving regulation of CDK4, CDK6 and EZH2 expression. In addition, the present findings further qualify miRNA-124 as a possible biomarker of early response to EGT in myeloid malignancies and potentially a valid therapeutic target, together with CDK4, CDK6 and EZH2.","['Liu, Hongbin', 'Pattie, Phillip', 'Chandrasekara, Sahan', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Dear, Anthony E']","['Liu H', 'Pattie P', 'Chandrasekara S', 'Spencer A', 'Dear AE']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia; Translational Research Division, Eastern Clinical Research Unit, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia; Translational Research Division, Eastern Clinical Research Unit, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia; Translational Research Division, Eastern Clinical Research Unit, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia; Department of Medicine, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3128, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160725,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC4998575,,2016/09/08 06:00,2016/09/08 06:01,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4912 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4912 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):2175-2180. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4912.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is altered in multiple types of human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The alteration in the expression of the novel human gene ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q1 (UBE2Q1), as a putative member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, has been reported in several malignancies, including carcinoma of the breast, hepatocellular and colorectal cancer, and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the present study, the effect of UBE2Q1 overexpression on cell growth, clonogenicity, motility and cell cycle was investigated in a CRC cell line. The UBE2Q1 gene was cloned in the pCMV6-AN-GFP expression vector. A series of stable transfectants of SW1116 cells overexpressing UBE2Q1 protein were established and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting. Using these cells, MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell growth and proliferation, while crystal violet staining was used for clonogenicity assay. Cell cycle analysis was also performed to survey the ratio of cells accumulated in different phases of the cell cycle upon transfection. The motility of these cells was also studied using wound healing assay. UBE2Q1 transfectants exhibited a faster growth in cell culture, increased colony formation capacity and enhanced motility compared with control non-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector (mock-transfected cells). UBE2Q1 overexpression also resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The present findings suggest that UBE2Q1 may function as an oncogene that induces proliferation of cancer cells, and could be a novel diagnostic tool and a potential therapeutic target for CRC.","['Fahmidehkar, Mohammad Ali', 'Shafiee, Sayed Mohammad', 'Eftekhar, Ebrahim', 'Mahbudi, Laleh', 'Seghatoleslam, Atefeh']","['Fahmidehkar MA', 'Shafiee SM', 'Eftekhar E', 'Mahbudi L', 'Seghatoleslam A']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz 71348-45794, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz 71348-45794, Iran.', 'Food and Cosmetic Health Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas 79158-73665, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz 71348-45794, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz 71348-45794, Iran; Histomorphometry and Stereology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz 71439-14693, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160713,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC4998499,,2016/09/08 06:00,2016/09/08 06:01,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4860 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4860 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):2169-2174. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4860.

Studies are required to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of surrogate biomarkers. Given the importance of angiogenesis in oncology in terms of pathogenesis as well as being a target for treatment, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are promising candidates to serve as such markers. The aim of the present study was to quantify CECs and EPCs in patients with AML at initial diagnosis and following induction chemotherapy, and to correlate these findings with the response to treatment in AML patients. The present study included 40 patients with de novo AML and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CECs and EPCs were evaluated by flow cytometry at initial diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy (3+7 protocol for AML other than M3 and all-trans-retinoic acid plus anthracycline for M3 disease). CECs and EPCs were significantly higher in AML patients at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy than in controls. After induction chemotherapy, CECs and EPCs were significantly decreased compared with the levels at initial diagnosis. Patients who achieved complete response (n=28) had lower initial CEC and EPC levels compared with patients who did not respond to treatment. These results suggest that CEC levels are higher in AML patients and may correlate with disease status and treatment response. Further investigations are required to better determine the predictive value and implication of these cells in AML management.","['Zahran, Asmaa Mohammed', 'Aly, Sanaa Shaker', 'Altayeb, Hanan Ahmed', 'Ali, Arwa Mohammed']","['Zahran AM', 'Aly SS', 'Altayeb HA', 'Ali AM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut 71111, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena 83523, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut 71111, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut 71111, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160713,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC4998591,,2016/09/08 06:00,2016/09/08 06:01,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2015/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4859 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4859 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Sep;12(3):1965-1970. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4859.

Because most patients will have chemotherapy-resistant disease, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment. Despite advances in current management, patients continue to have poor outcomes and lack of durable responses. Thus, new therapies with alternative modes of actions are currently being investigated. Blinatumomab is a novel bispecific T-cell engager that simultaneously binds CD3-positive cytotoxic T-cells and CD19-positive B-cells, resulting in selective lysis of tumor cells. It has shown promising results in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or those achieving hematologic response with persistent minimum residual disease. Future clinical trials will answer questions regarding its optimal place in the treatment paradigm. Dose-limiting toxicities include immunological toxicities and cytokine release syndrome. However, most patients tolerate the therapy relatively well. This review will focus on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and safety of blinatumomab in the treatment of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia while highlighting its unique drug warnings and toxicity management.","['Lee, Kum Ja', 'Chow, Vivian', 'Weissman, Ashley', 'Tulpule, Sunil', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Akhtari, Mojtaba']","['Lee KJ', 'Chow V', 'Weissman A', 'Tulpule S', 'Aldoss I', 'Akhtari M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, University of Southern California.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, University of Southern California.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Southern California Norris Cancer Hospital, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Raritan Bay Medical Center, Perth Amboy, NJ.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology and Center for the Study of Blood Diseases, University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160825,New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,,,PMC5003562,,2016/09/08 06:00,2016/09/08 06:01,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/TCRM.S84261 [doi]', 'tcrm-12-1301 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2016 Aug 25;12:1301-10. doi: 10.2147/TCRM.S84261. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'BiTE', 'Blincyto', 'relapsed/refractory']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was first used in 1938 by John H Lawrence in the treatment of polycythaemia and chronic leukaemias. With the introduction of agents such as hydroxycarbamide, interferon and anagrelide the role of (32)P has been diminished. Today, Polycythaemia Rubra Vera (PRV) and Essential Thrombocythaemia (ET) remain the only myeloproliferative conditions in which (32)P is indicated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of all patients who had received 32P in Northern Ireland over a 24 year period. The time to successful response, duration of response, and associated complications were reviewed. RESULTS: (32)P was successful in inducing remission in 90% of patients. This remission was sustained following one dose without the need for further therapy in 37% of cases. 47% required repeated doses. 26% required recommencement of alternative therapies. No cases of thrombosis, myelofibrosis or acute leukaemia were observed. DISCUSSION: We conclude that (32)P is a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment option in the elderly. We discuss our results compared with previous work in this area. (32)P will continue to be offered to elderly patients in our practice.","['Lawless, Sarah', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Cuthbert, Robert', 'Houston, Russell']","['Lawless S', 'McMullin MF', 'Cuthbert R', 'Houston R']","['Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast N.

We previously reported that exosomes released from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can suppress residual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function indirectly through stromal reprogramming of niche retention factors. We found that the systemic loss of hematopoietic function is also in part a consequence of AML exosome-directed microRNA (miRNA) trafficking to HSPCs. Exosomes isolated from cultured AML or the plasma from mice bearing AML xenografts exhibited enrichment of miR-150 and miR-155. HSPCs cocultured with either of these exosomes exhibited impaired clonogenicity, through the miR-150- and miR-155-mediated suppression of the translation of transcripts encoding c-MYB, a transcription factor involved in HSPC differentiation and proliferation. To discover additional miRNA targets, we captured miR-155 and its target transcripts by coimmunoprecipitation with an attenuated RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-trap, followed by high-throughput sequencing. This approach identified known and previously unknown miR-155 target transcripts. Integration of the miR-155 targets with information from the protein interaction database STRING revealed proteins indirectly affected by AML exosome-derived miRNA. Our findings indicate a direct effect of AML exosomes on HSPCs that, through a stroma-independent mechanism, compromises hematopoiesis. Furthermore, combining miRNA target data with protein-protein interaction data may be a broadly applicable strategy to define the effects of exosome-mediated trafficking of regulatory molecules within the tumor microenvironment.","['Hornick, Noah I', 'Doron, Ben', 'Abdelhamed, Sherif', 'Huan, Jianya', 'Harrington, Christina A', 'Shen, Rongkun', 'Cambronne, Xiaolu A', 'Chakkaramakkil Verghese, Santhosh', 'Kurre, Peter']","['Hornick NI', 'Doron B', 'Abdelhamed S', 'Huan J', 'Harrington CA', 'Shen R', 'Cambronne XA', 'Chakkaramakkil Verghese S', 'Kurre P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.

This phase I study determined its recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluated its safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity alone and with rituximab in relapsed/refractory (r/r) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Experimental Design: Patients received escalating doses of pinatuzumab vedotin every 21 days. Clinical activity at the RP2D alone or with rituximab was evaluated in r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and r/r indolent NHL (iNHL) patients.Results: Seventy-five patients received single-agent pinatuzumab vedotin. The RP2D was 2.4 mg/kg, based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of grade 4 neutropenia >7 days in 1 of 3 patients and grade 4 neutropenia <7 days in 2 of 3 patients treated at 3.2 mg/kg (maximum assessed dose). No DLTs occurred at 2.4 mg/kg. At the RP2D, neutropenia was the most common grade >/=3 adverse event. Peripheral neuropathy-related grade >/=2 adverse events most frequently resulted in treatment discontinuation. Rituximab cotreatment did not impact safety, tolerability, or pharmacokinetics of pinatuzumab vedotin. Unconjugated MMAE exposure was much lower than antibody-conjugated MMAE exposure, without accumulation with repeat dosing. At the RP2D, objective responses were observed in DLBCL (9/25) and iNHL (7/14) patients; 2 of 8 patients treated with pinatuzumab vedotin (RP2D) and rituximab had complete responses. CLL patients showed no objective responses.Conclusions: The RP2D of pinatuzumab vedotin alone and with rituximab was 2.4 mg/kg, which was well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity in r/r NHL.

Whether the genetic basis of MDS influences the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 401 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS (MDS/AML). We used massively parallel sequencing to examine tumor samples collected before HSCT for somatic mutations in 34 recurrently mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms. We then analyzed the impact of mutations on the outcome of HSCT. RESULTS: Overall, 87% of patients carried one or more oncogenic mutations. Somatic mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 were independent predictors of relapse and overall survival after HSCT in both patients with MDS and patients with MDS/AML (P values ranging from .003 to .035). In patients with MDS/AML, gene ontology (ie, secondary-type AML carrying mutations in genes of RNA splicing machinery, TP53-mutated AML, or de novo AML) was an independent predictor of posttransplantation outcome (P = .013). The impact of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 mutations on posttransplantation survival was independent of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Combining somatic mutations and IPSS-R risk improved the ability to stratify patients by capturing more prognostic information at an individual level. Accounting for various combinations of IPSS-R risk and somatic mutations, the 5-year probability of survival after HSCT ranged from 0% to 73%. CONCLUSION: Somatic mutation in ASXL1, RUNX1, or TP53 is independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after allogeneic HSCT for patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Accounting for these genetic lesions may improve the prognostication precision in clinical practice and in designing clinical trials.","['Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Galli, Anna', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Zibellini, Silvia', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Rizzo, Ettore', 'Allione, Bernardino', 'van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Marenco, Paola', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Sica, Simona', 'Cuzzola, Mariella', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Ubezio, Marta', 'Malovini, Alberto', 'Limongelli, Ivan', 'Ferretti, Virginia V', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Tresoldi, Cristina', 'Pozzi, Sarah', 'Luchetti, Silvia', 'Pezzetti, Laura', 'Catricala, Silvia', 'Milanesi, Chiara', 'Riva, Alberto', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Bellazzi, Riccardo', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Santoro, Armando', 'Alessandrino, Emilio P', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Della Porta MG', 'Galli A', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Zibellini S', 'Bernardi M', 'Rizzo E', 'Allione B', 'van Lint MT', 'Pioltelli P', 'Marenco P', 'Bosi A', 'Voso MT', 'Sica S', 'Cuzzola M', 'Angelucci E', 'Rossi M', 'Ubezio M', 'Malovini A', 'Limongelli I', 'Ferretti VV', 'Spinelli O', 'Tresoldi C', 'Pozzi S', 'Luchetti S', 'Pezzetti L', 'Catricala S', 'Milanesi C', 'Riva A', 'Bruno B', 'Ciceri F', 'Bonifazi F', 'Bellazzi R', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Santoro A', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Rambaldi A', 'Cazzola M']","[""Matteo G.

Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) is a legume lectin that recognizes terminal N-acetylgalactosaminides with high affinity. WFA preferentially binds the disaccharide LacdiNAc (beta-d-GalNAc-[1-->4]-d-GlcNAc), which is associated with tumor malignancy in leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers and has shown promise in cancer glycobiomarker detection. The mechanism of specificity for WFA recognition of LacdiNAc is not fully understood. To address this problem, we have determined affinities and structure of WFA in complex with GalNAc and LacdiNAc. Affinities toward Gal, GalNAc, and LacdiNAc were measured via surface plasmon resonance, yielding KD values of 4.67 x 10(-4) m, 9.24 x 10(-5) m, and 5.45 x 10(-6) m, respectively. Structures of WFA in complex with LacdiNAc and GalNAc have been determined to 1.80-2.32 A resolution. These high resolution structures revealed a hydrophobic groove complementary to the GalNAc and, to a minor extent, to the back-face of the GlcNAc sugar ring. Remarkably, the contribution of this small hydrophobic surface significantly increases the observed affinity for LacdiNAc over GalNAc. Tandem MS sequencing confirmed the presence of two isolectin forms in commercially available WFA differing only in the identities of two amino acids. Finally, the WFA carbohydrate binding site is similar to a homologous lectin isolated from Vatairea macrocarpa in complex with GalNAc, which, unlike WFA, binds not only alphaGalNAc but also terminal Ser/Thr O-linked alphaGalNAc (Tn antigen).","['Haji-Ghassemi, Omid', 'Gilbert, Michel', 'Spence, Jenifer', 'Schur, Melissa J', 'Parker, Matthew J', 'Jenkins, Meredith L', 'Burke, John E', 'van Faassen, Henk', 'Young, N Martin', 'Evans, Stephen V']","['Haji-Ghassemi O', 'Gilbert M', 'Spence J', 'Schur MJ', 'Parker MJ', 'Jenkins ML', 'Burke JE', 'van Faassen H', 'Young NM', 'Evans SV']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and.', 'Human Health Therapeutics, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0R6, Canada.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and.', 'Human Health Therapeutics, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0R6, Canada.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and.', 'Human Health Therapeutics, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0R6, Canada.', 'Human Health Therapeutics, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0R6, Canada.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 3P6, Canada and svevans@uvic.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Lactose/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Plant Lectins/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Wisteria/*chemistry']",PMC5104934,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34678-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.750463 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Nov 11;291(46):24085-24095. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.750463.

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, comprehensive analysis on 178 patients with CLL (ibrutinib = 143; idelalisib = 35) who discontinued KI therapy. We examined responses, toxicity, post-KI therapies, and overall survival (OS). Patients had a median of 3 prior therapies (range 0-11); del17p (34%), p53 mutation (27%), del11q (33%), and complex karyotype (29%). Overall response rate (ORR) to first KI was 62% (complete response 14%). The most common reasons for KI discontinuation were toxicity (51%), CLL progression (29%), and Richter transformation (RT) (8%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS from KI initiation were 10.5 and 29 months, respectively. Notably, initial KI choice did not impact PFS or OS; however, RT portended significantly inferior OS (P = .0007). One hundred fourteen patients received subsequent salvage therapy following KI discontinuation with an ORR to subsequent KI at 50% and a median PFS of 11.9 months. Median PFS in KI-intolerant patients treated with an alternate KI was not reached vs 7 months for patients with CLL progression. In summary, these data demonstrate that toxicity was the most common reason for KI discontinuation, that patients who discontinue KI due to toxicity can respond to an alternate KI, and that these responses may be durable.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed data of 301 patients with newly diagnosed t-AML who sought care from January 2000 to January 2014 (183 t-AML without AHD, 118 t-AML with AHD). Overall, median follow-up was 44 months. RESULTS: The primary malignancy was non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 92 (31%), breast cancer in 80 (27%), and prostate cancer in 49 (16%). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) in t-AML without or with AHD was 10 months and 29 months, respectively (P = .032); median overall survival (OS) was 8 months and 8 months, respectively (P = .53). Multivariate analysis for OS identified older age, poor performance status, thrombocytopenia, nonfavorable cytogenetics, and lack of response as adverse factors. CONCLUSION: The favorable-risk cohort had better RFS and OS compared to the outcomes of patients in the intermediate- and adverse-risk cohorts; the RFS and OS did not differ between intermediate- and adverse-risk cohorts.

Scarce information is available regarding the treatment and survival rates from nonindustrialized populations. In the present study, the characteristics of adults with ALL at a single institution were documented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical files of patients aged >/= 18 years who had been diagnosed with ALL from 2005 to 2015 at a reference center in Mexico were scrutinized. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios for death and relapse were estimated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 94 adults were included. Their median age was 33 years; 69 (73.4%) had high-risk and 25 (26.6%) had standard-risk ALL. Of the 94 patients, 67 (71.3%) achieved complete remission (CR), 20 (21.3%) experienced disease resistance, and 7 (7.4%) died early during induction to remission, mainly of sepsis. The 5-year EFS and OS was 23.4% and 31.1% for the whole group and 24.9% and 38.9% for patients who achieved CR, respectively. Of the 94 patients, 50 (43.9%) died of sepsis or disease progression. Relapse developed in 43 patients (45.7%). The median survival after relapse was 6.93 months. Bone marrow was the most frequent site of relapse (21 patients [48.8%]) and conferred a significantly lower 5-year OS of 16.4%. CONCLUSION: Adults with ALL in Mexico had high-risk characteristics and an increased relapse rate; however, the OS after CR was similar to the greatest achieved in developed countries, suggesting that a threshold for curing adult ALL with current therapeutic strategies has been reached.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Jimenez-Castillo, Raul Alberto', 'Herrera-Garza, Jose Luis', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Homero', 'Marfil-Rivera, Luis Javier', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Jimenez-Castillo RA', 'Herrera-Garza JL', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre H', 'Marfil-Rivera LJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Department of Hematology, ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" University Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.

Accordingly, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX) maintenance therapy is adjusted by a common WBC target of 1.5-3.0 x 10(9)/L. Consequently, the absolute degree of myelosuppression is unknown for the individual child and we wanted to evaluate this. METHODS: A median of 22 (range 8-27) 6MP/MTX metabolite samples and 100 (range 25-130) blood counts during therapy and 10 (range 2-15) off therapy were collected in 50 children with ALL. Differences between off-therapy and on-therapy WBCs [including absolute neutrophil (ANC) and lymphocyte counts (ALC)] were used to retrospectively approximate the absolute myelosuppression (=""delta-"") and association with age, sex and 6MP/MTX doses explored. We applied linear mixed models to estimate on-therapy counts by 6MP/MTX metabolites: DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotides (DNA-TGN), erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotides (ery-TGN), erythrocyte-methylated 6MP metabolites (ery-MeMP) and erythrocyte MTX polyglutamates with 2-6 glutamate residues (ery-MTXpg2-6). RESULTS: On-therapy WBC was correlated with ANC and ALC (r s = 0.84 and r s = 0.33, p values <0.001), whereas ANC was weakly correlated with ALC (r s = -0.11, p < 0.001), and neither significantly correlated with age. Off-therapy ALC, but not ANC, was strongly correlated with age (r s = -0.68 and -0.18, p < 0.001 and p = 0.22). Delta-ALC decreased with increasing age (r s = -0.69, p < 0.001). Incorporation of DNA-TGN was positively associated with ery-TGN (p < 0.001), ery-MeMP (p < 0.001) and ery-MTXpg2-6 (p = 0.047). On-therapy ALC decreased with increasing DNA-TGN level (p < 0.001, model adjusted for off-therapy ALC), whereas on-therapy ANC could not be modeled reliably. CONCLUSION: Measurements of 6MP/MTX metabolites could supplement blood counts in assessing therapy intensity, but require prospective validation.","['Nielsen, Stine Nygaard', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Hjalgrim, Lisa Lyngsie', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Nielsen SN', 'Grell K', 'Nersting J', 'Frandsen TL', 'Hjalgrim LL', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, JMC-4072, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. kjeld.schmiegelow@regionh.dk.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kjeld.schmiegelow@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aging/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Neutrophils', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment']",,,2016/10/28 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-016-3151-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-016-3151-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2016 Nov;78(5):983-994. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3151-2.

HES can be used during therapeutic leukocytapheresis (TL) procedures to enhance cell separation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of adverse events associated with HES during TL procedures. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent TL with and without HES in the period 2009 to 2013 at six academic medical institutions. RESULTS: A difference-in-difference regression analysis was used to estimate the mean change before and after TL in selected outcomes in the HES group relative to the average change in the non-HES group. Selected outcomes included serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and white blood cell (WBC) count. A total of 195 patients who underwent 278 TL procedures were studied. We found no significant differences in serum creatinine levels and eGFR on Days 1 and 7 after TL procedure between patients who received and those who did not receive HES. The rate of adverse events and overall and early mortality were similar in both groups. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received HES had greater WBC reduction when HES was used. Additionally, patients who received HES had improvement in pulmonary leukostasis symptoms. CONCLUSION: HES, used at low doses during TL procedures, was not associated with adverse events previously ascribed to its use as a volume expander.","['Pagano, Monica B', 'Harmon, Charles', 'Cooling, Laura', 'Connelly-Smith, Laura', 'Mann, Steven A', 'Pham, Huy P', 'Marques, Marisa B', 'Schlueter, Annette J', 'Case, Rosemary', 'King, Karen E', 'Cataife, Guido', 'Wu, Yanyun', 'Wong, Edward C C', 'Winters, Jeffrey L']","['Pagano MB', 'Harmon C', 'Cooling L', 'Connelly-Smith L', 'Mann SA', 'Pham HP', 'Marques MB', 'Schlueter AJ', 'Case R', 'King KE', 'Cataife G', 'Wu Y', 'Wong EC', 'Winters JL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Health Division, IMPAQ International, Columbia, Maryland.', 'Bloodworks Northwest, Seattle, Washington.', ""Division of Laboratory Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology, Children's National Medical Center, George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Transfusion Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160907,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives/*adverse effects', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukostasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Substitutes/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.13795 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Nov;56(11):2848-2856. doi: 10.1111/trf.13795.

Improved clinical supply and contingency planning requires greater understanding of usage profiles and urgency of clinical requirement. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a random-sample survey of PLT and plasma units produced in Victoria, Australia, to determine product disposition, recipient demographics, clinical indications for transfusion, and urgency (or ""deferability"") of need. PLTs and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) were tagged with a case report form before distribution. RESULTS: A total of 1252 PLT and 1837 FFP units were tagged, comprising 8.3 and 13.3% of all products issued during the study period. The fate of 1243 PLT and 1808 FFP units was determined. Of products issued, 72.2% of PLTs and 87.8% of FFP were transfused. Hematologic and oncologic disorders accounted for 63.9% of PLT transfusions, with acute myeloid leukemia alone accounting for 26%. Conversely, surgical patients received the largest proportion of FFP (40.4%), predominantly for cardiothoracic, solid organ transplant, and vascular surgery. Approximately 15% of PLT transfusions and 35% of plasma transfusions were required within 1 hour, and 80% of PLT transfusions and 90% of FFP transfusions were required within 24 hours. Wastage rates were higher in regional blood banks. CONCLUSION: The PUPPY study is a comprehensive and detailed population-based assessment of PLT and plasma usage, including urgency of use. It identifies specific clinical areas with high demand for PLT and FFP transfusion and demonstrates the high urgency of need for both products. These data inform clinical supply and contingency planning activities.","['Fedele, Pasquale L', 'Polizzotto, Mark N', 'Grigoriadis, George', 'Waters, Neil', 'Comande, Mary', 'Borosak, Marija', 'Portbury, David', 'Wood, Erica M']","['Fedele PL', 'Polizzotto MN', 'Grigoriadis G', 'Waters N', 'Comande M', 'Borosak M', 'Portbury D', 'Wood EM']","['The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia. pasquale.fedele@monashhealth.org.', 'Monash Haematology, Parkville. pasquale.fedele@monashhealth.org.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia. pasquale.fedele@monashhealth.org.', 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales.', ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia."", 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Monash Haematology, Parkville.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, Monash Health, Clayton, Australia.', 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Transfusion Research Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Australia."", 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Eastern Health, Box Hill, Australia.', 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Australia. erica.wood@monash.edu.', 'Monash Haematology, Parkville. erica.wood@monash.edu.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, Monash Health, Clayton, Australia. erica.wood@monash.edu.', 'Transfusion Research Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. erica.wood@monash.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Blood Banks/methods/standards', 'Blood Component Transfusion/*statistics & numerical data', '*Blood Platelets', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Planning Techniques', '*Plasma', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.13778 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Oct;56(10):2455-2465. doi: 10.1111/trf.13778.

RhoA- and RhoC-induced gene transcription via the actin-regulated transcriptional co-activator megakaryocytic leukemia (MKL) and serum response factor (SRF) drive metastasis in breast cancer and melanoma. We recently identified a compound, CCG-1423, which blocks Rho/MKL/SRF-mediated transcription and inhibits PC-3 prostate cancer cell invasion. Here, we undertook a genome-wide expression study in PC-3 cells to explore the mechanism and function of this compound. There was significant overlap in the genes modulated by CCG-1423 and Latrunculin B (Lat B), which blocks the Rho/MKL/SRF pathway by preventing actin polymerization. In contrast, the general transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB) showed a markedly different pattern. Effects of CCG-1423 and Lat B on gene expression correlated with literature studies of MKL knock-down. Gene sets involved in DNA synthesis and repair, G1/S transition, and apoptosis were modulated by CCG-1423. It also upregulated genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress. Targets of the known Rho target transcription factor family E2F and genes related to melanoma progression and metastasis were strongly suppressed by CCG-1423. These results confirm the ability of our compound to inhibit expression of numerous Rho/MKL-dependent genes and show effects on stress pathways as well. This suggests a novel approach to targeting aggressive cancers and metastasis.","['Evelyn, Chris R', 'Lisabeth, Erika M', 'Wade, Susan M', 'Haak, Andrew J', 'Johnson, Craig N', 'Lawlor, Elizabeth R', 'Neubig, Richard R']","['Evelyn CR', 'Lisabeth EM', 'Wade SM', 'Haak AJ', 'Johnson CN', 'Lawlor ER', 'Neubig RR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

Many hematopoietic malignancies are characterized by structural chromosomal abnormalities such as specific translocations, inversions, deletions and/or numerical abnormalities that can be identified by karyotype analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays offer high-resolution identification of copy number variants (CNVs) and acquired copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH)/uniparental disomy (UPD) that are usually not identifiable by conventional cytogenetic analysis and FISH studies. As a result, SNP arrays have been increasingly applied to hematopoietic neoplasms to search for clinically-significant genetic abnormalities. A large numbers of CNVs and UPDs have been identified in a variety of hematopoietic neoplasms. CNVs detected by SNP array in some hematopoietic neoplasms are of prognostic significance. A few specific genes in the affected regions have been implicated in the pathogenesis and may be the targets for specific therapeutic agents in the future.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected 234 patients with CML in CP, who were treated with imatinib mesylate (IM). Patients were stratified into low-, intermediate- and high- risk groups according to three scoring systems (Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS), respectively. We compared the agreement of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS) in CML patients stratified by three prognostic scoring systems. The median for follow-up was 20.5 months. RESULTS: EUTOS scoring system: In the low- and high-risk groups, the 5-year OS was 94.6% and 84.7% (P=0.011), 5-year EFS was 92.6% and 77.6% (P=0.001), and 5-year PFS was 95.3% and 82.4% (P=0.001), respectively. While stratified by Sokal or Hasford scoring system, there was no significant the correlation between low-, intermediate- and high- risk groups with the prognosis for CML patients (P>0.05). Compared with Sokal and Hasford scoring system, the outcome of EUTOS prognostic scoring system showed highly accordance with 5-year expect OS, PFS and EFS of CML patients. CONCLUSION: EUTOS scoring system could predict the long-time outcome of CML-CP patients better than Sokal and Hasford scoring system. Chang of treatment may affect the prognostic value of EUTOS scoring system.","['Huang, Jing', 'Zhao, Xielan']","['Huang J', 'Zhao X']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Dysregulation of such signals contributes to malignant transformation, thereby giving the cancer cells a survival advantage, but also could be exploited for new anticancer interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pan class-I PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 on two distinct acute leukemia cell lines, NB4 (with mutant p53) and Nalm-6 (with wild-type p53). Our data highlighted the efficacy of the inhibitor against APL and pre B ALL cell lines; however, we failed to find an obvious correlation between p53 status and the sensitivity of leukemic cells to NVP-BKM120. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of p53 target genes in Nalm-6 cells, indicating a p53-dependent mechanism involved in NVP-BKM120 cytotoxicity. On the other hand, cytotoxic effects in mutant p53-expressing NB4 cells seem to be mediated mostly by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB axis. In conclusion, we suggest NVP-BKM120 induces apoptosis through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms, indicating the potential application of the inhibitor in both wild-type and deficient p53-expressing leukemic cells.","['Bashash, Davood', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Delshad, Mahda', 'Bayati, Samaneh', 'Nooshinfar, Elaheh', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Bashash D', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Delshad M', 'Bayati S', 'Nooshinfar E', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Department of Hematology and Blood banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The burden of viral hepatitis in patients with haematological malignancies and the weak evidence on which previous guidelines are based has prompted the European Conference on Infection in Leukaemia (ECIL-5) to convene a group of experts in the fields of viral hepatitis and of haematological malignancy to specifically address previously unconsidered issues and grade the available quality of evidence according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America grading system. The group recommends that all patients should be screened for hepatotropic viruses before haematological treatment and that patients or haemopoietic stem cell donors with markers of past or current viral hepatitis should be assessed by an expert. Screening, vaccination, and treatment rules are reported in this Review.","['Mallet, Vincent', 'van Bommel, Florian', 'Doerig, Christopher', 'Pischke, Sven', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Locasciulli, Anna', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Berg, Thomas', 'Moradpour, Darius', 'Wedemeyer, Heiner', 'Ljungman, Per']","['Mallet V', 'van Bommel F', 'Doerig C', 'Pischke S', 'Hermine O', 'Locasciulli A', 'Cordonnier C', 'Berg T', 'Moradpour D', 'Wedemeyer H', 'Ljungman P']","['Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Institut Pasteur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 1223, Paris, France; Hepatology Service, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Groupe Hospitalier Cochin Port-Royal, Paris, France.

However, its role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains to be further clarified. METHODS: The expression of YAP in CML cells was determined by western blotting. Next, the effects of YAP knockdown and YAP inhibitor on CML cells were evaluated by MTT assay, flow cytometry (FCM) and Wright's staining. Moreover, K562 induced mice model was employed to further investigate the role of YAP in vivo. RESULTS: YAP was overexpressed in CML cells. Knockdown of YAP by si-RNA or inhibition the function of YAP using verteporfin (VP) not only inhibited the proliferation, induced the apoptosis of CML cells but also reduced the expression of YAP target genes c-myc and survivin. Additionally, VP enhanced the efficacy of imatinib (IM) in vitro and suppressed leukemogenesis in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that YAP may play an important role in the proliferation and leukemogenesis of CML cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP provides a novel treatment strategy for CML.","['Li, Hui', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Gao, Miao', 'Huang, Ningshu', 'Luo, Zhenhong', 'Shen, Huawei', 'Wang, Xin', 'Wang, Teng', 'Hu, Jing', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Li H', 'Huang Z', 'Gao M', 'Huang N', 'Luo Z', 'Shen H', 'Wang X', 'Wang T', 'Hu J', 'Feng W']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No.1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, China. fengwlcqmu@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Porphyrins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Verteporfin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",PMC5012077,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-016-0414-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-016-0414-z [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 6;35(1):134. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0414-z.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', '0X9PA28K43 (Verteporfin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcr/Abl', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*IM', '*Leukemogenesis', '*Verteporfin', '*YAP']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated whether expression ratios of immunoproteasome to constitutive proteasome in leukaemic cells correlated with response to bortezomib-containing re-induction chemotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory acute leukaemia, enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group phase 2 trials of bortezomib for ALL (COG-AALL07P1) and AML (COG-AAML07P1). Expression of proteasome subunits was examined in 72 patient samples (ALL n = 60, AML n = 12) obtained before start of therapy. Statistical significance between groups was determined by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Ratios of immunoproteasome to constitutive proteasome subunit expression were significantly higher in pre-B ALL cells than in AML cells for both beta5i/beta5 and beta1i/beta1 subunits (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). These ratios correlated with therapy response in AML patients; beta1i/beta1 ratios were significantly higher (p = 0.028) between patients who did (n = 4) and did not reach complete remission (CR) (n = 8), although for beta5i/beta5 ratios, this did not reach significance. For ALL patients, the subunit ratios were also higher for patients who showed a good early response to therapy but this relation was not statistically significant. Overall, for this study, the patients were treated with combination therapy, so response was not only attributed to proteasome inhibition. Moreover, the leukaemic blast cells were not purified for these samples. CONCLUSIONS: These first ex vivo results encourage further studies into relative proteasome subunit expression to improve proteasome inhibition-containing therapy and as a potential indicator of bortezomib response in acute leukaemia.","['Niewerth, Denise', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Jenkins, Gaye', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'van de Ven, Peter M', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Niewerth D', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Jansen G', 'van Meerloo J', 'Zweegman S', 'Jenkins G', 'Whitlock JA', 'Hunger SP', 'Lu X', 'Alonzo TA', 'van de Ven PM', 'Horton TM', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Amsterdam Rheumatology & Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, USA.', 'COG Operations Office, Arcadia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.cloos@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.cloos@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160906,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Bortezomib/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoproteins/analysis', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*analysis', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Subunits/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC5011854,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0312-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0312-z [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 6;9(1):82. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0312-z.,"['K23 CA113775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Immunoproteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bortezomib', '*Immunoproteasome', '*Pediatric acute leukaemia', '*Proteasome inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient-specific iPSCs harboring disease-specific mutations are extremely useful for investigating disease mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. In the field of hematology, attempts to establish iPSCs from tumor cells such as those of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were largely unsuccessful because proper reprogramming processes were hampered by their extensive genetic alterations. In contrast, congenital disorders caused by a single genetic mutation are ideal candidates for deriving iPSCs. We have been investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia and MDS by implementing iPSC technology. Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high propensity for developing acute leukemia, which is caused by heterozygous mutation of RUNX1. We have successfully established iPSCs from three distinct FPD pedigrees and examined the responsible defect during hematopoietic development. This system will serve as a novel unprecedented platform for prospectively studying hematologic disorders using human cells.","['Nakajima, Hideaki']",['Nakajima H'],"['Department of stem cell and Immune regulation, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/congenital/genetics/*pathology']",,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.57.1087 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2016 Aug;57(8):1087-94. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.57.1087.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a critical issue still awaits resolution; it is difficult to efficiently expand tumor antigen-specific T cells. To solve this problem, we are now utilizing iPS cell technology. When iPS cells are established from tumor antigen specific T cells, T cells regenerated from these iPS cells are expected to express the same TCRs as the original T cells. In line with this concept, we succeeded in regenerating tumor antigen specific cytotoxic T cells. The regenerated T cells exhibited TCR specific killing activity comparable to that of the original cells, and were able to kill leukemia cells in an antigen-specific manner. We are currently endeavoring to apply this method clinically. In the future, we intend to establish an allogeneic transfusion system, in which various tumor antigen specific T-iPS cells from a wide range of HLA haplotype homozygous donors will be lined up as a ""T-iPS cell bank"", with the aim of making off-the-shelf tumor immunotherapy a reality.","['Maeda, Takuya', 'Masuda, Kyoko', 'Kawamoto, Hiroshi']","['Maeda T', 'Masuda K', 'Kawamoto H']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Medical Science, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,2016/09/08 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/09/08 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.57.1066 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2016 Aug;57(8):1066-73. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.57.1066.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are, however, limited means for prospectively identifying these subpopulations, which hinders an understanding of therapeutic resistance. BH3 profiling is a functional single-cell analysis using synthetic BCL-2 BH3 domain-like peptides that measures mitochondrial apoptotic sensitivity or ""priming."" Here, we observed that the extent of apoptotic priming is heterogeneous within multiple cancer cell lines and is not the result of experimental noise. Apoptotic priming was also heterogeneous in treatment-naive primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) myeloblasts, and this heterogeneity decreased in chemotherapy-treated AML patients. The priming of the most apoptosis-resistant tumor cells, rather than the median priming of the population, best predicted patient response to induction chemotherapy. For several patients, these poorly primed subpopulations of AML tumor cells were enriched for antiapoptotic proteins. Developing techniques to identify and understand these apoptosis-insensitive subpopulations of tumor cells may yield insights into clinical chemoresistance and potentially improve therapeutic outcomes in AML.","['Bhola, Patrick D', 'Mar, Brenton G', 'Lindsley, R Coleman', 'Ryan, Jeremy A', 'Hogdal, Leah J', 'Vo, Thanh Trang', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Bhola PD', 'Mar BG', 'Lindsley RC', 'Ryan JA', 'Hogdal LJ', 'Vo TT', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Galinsky I', 'Ebert BL', 'Letai A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160906,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",PMC5096802,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/09/07 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['82908 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI82908 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Oct 3;126(10):3827-3836. doi: 10.1172/JCI82908.

Most flow cytometric strategies for detecting B cell malignancy utilize CD19 to identify B cells. With growing use of anti-CD19 targeted therapies, alternative strategies are needed for residual disease detection. We describe an approach for residual disease detection in this setting. METHODS: A novel combination was designed using expression of CD22 or CD24 (without CD66b) for B cell detection in combination with markers aberrantly expressed in B-LL (CD10, CD20, CD34, CD38, and CD45). The performance characteristics of this combination were evaluated and compared to a standard, validated B-LL MRD assay using 10 known negative samples, 10 overtly positive samples, and 11 post-therapy samples (prior therapy other than anti-CD19 therapy). Subsequently, results from the first 100 samples on which the new tube was performed were reviewed. RESULTS: The described combination performed well in the initial analysis of 31 samples with all negative and positive samples correctly classified. In positive samples, the percentage of abnormal cells correlated well between the standard and new assay. Evaluation of the first 100 samples demonstrated good performance with adequate detection of CD19-positive and CD19-negative B-LL. Additionally, it was observed that patients receiving anti-CD19 therapies demonstrate an increased proportion of CD19-negative progenitors. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings describe a strategy that performs well for residual disease detection in B-LL post anti-CD19 therapy. Such alternative strategies will become more important as the use of targeted immunotherapies becomes more common.

Cell-based kinase assays are needed to understand how potential kinase inhibitors act on their targets in a physiologically relevant context. Current cell-based kinase assays rely on antibody-based detection of endogenous substrates, inaccurate disease models, or indirect measurements of drug action. Here we expand on previous work from our lab to introduce a 96-well plate compatible approach for measuring cell-based kinase activity in disease-relevant human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines using an exogenously added, multi-functional peptide substrate. Our cellular models natively express the BcrAbl oncogene and are either sensitive or have acquired resistance to well-characterized BcrAbl tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This approach measures IC50 values comparable to established methods of assessing drug potency, and its robustness indicates that it can be employed in drug discovery applications.

In particular, CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4/CXCR7 control the homeostasis of multiple organs and systems. Their overexpression is linked to tumor development, both through a direct modulation of neoplastic cell proliferation, survival, and migration, and, indirectly, acting on the tumor microenvironment which sustains drug resistant tumor stem-like cells. Leukemia and lymphomas frequently display upregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 in bone marrow that nurtures tumor cells, and confers resistance to conventional chemotherapy, increasing disease relapse. Areas covered: The authors review the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the CXCL12/CXCR4-7 system supports leukemic bone marrow and how it contributes to leukemia development, and their potential pharmacological targeting. Besides receptor antagonists that directly inhibit leukemic cell proliferation, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that CXCR4 inhibition mobilizes leukemic-lymphoma cells from their niches, improving conventional chemotherapy efficacy. Clinically available and experimental pharmacological tools targeting CXCR4/CXCR7 are also described. Expert opinion: Studies have revealed the therapeutic efficacy of combining CXCR4 inhibitors and cytotoxic agents to sensitize leukemic cells, and overcome natural or acquired resistance. However, several issues are still to be unveiled (for example the role of CXCR7) to maximize therapeutic response and reduce potential toxicities.","['Barbieri, Federica', 'Bajetto, Adriana', 'Thellung, Stefano', 'Wurth, Roberto', 'Florio, Tullio']","['Barbieri F', 'Bajetto A', 'Thellung S', 'Wurth R', 'Florio T']","['a Department of Internal Medicine, and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR) , University of Genova , Genova , Italy.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR) , University of Genova , Genova , Italy.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR) , University of Genova , Genova , Italy.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR) , University of Genova , Genova , Italy.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR) , University of Genova , Genova , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160920,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Receptors, CXCR/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/09/07 06:00'],"['2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1233176 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Nov;11(11):1093-1109. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1233176.

This knowledge has substantially improved our understanding of tumor pathogenesis. In hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, pioneering work combining multi-parameter flow cytometry and targeted resequencing in leukemia have clearly shown that different classes of mutations appear to be acquired in particular sequences along the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy. Moreover, as these mutations can be found in ""normal"" cells recovered during remission and can be detected at relapse, there is strong evidence for the existence of ""pre-leukemic"" stem cells (pre-LSC). These cells, while phenotypically normal by flow cytometry, morphology, and functional studies, are speculated to be molecularly poised to transform owing to a limited number of predisposing mutations. Identifying these ""pre-leukemic"" mutations and how they propagate a pre-malignant state has important implications for understanding the etiology of these disorders and for the development of novel therapeutics. NGS studies have found a substantial enrichment for mutations in epigenetic/chromatin remodeling regulators in pre-LSC, and elegant genetic models have confirmed that these mutations can predispose to a variety of hematological malignancies. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of pre-leukemic biology in myeloid malignancies, and how mutations in two key epigenetic regulators, DNMT3A and TET2, may contribute to disease pathogenesis.","['Sato, Hanae', 'Wheat, Justin C', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Ito, Keisuke']","['Sato H', 'Wheat JC', 'Steidl U', 'Ito K']","['Ruth L. and David S.

With a median follow-up of 5 years, the estimated 5-year relapse-free survival and overall survival were 58% and 66%, respectively. Patients who were in molecular remission at the completion of consolidation chemotherapy had a 21% risk of relapse, while the relapse risk for those in molecular remission at the end of 2 years was 5.5%. Our data indicate that postconsolidation molecular remission does not necessarily preclude disease relapse and further monitoring is required. In contrast, molecular negativity by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at the end of 2 years is associated with a low risk of relapse.","['Deotare, Uday', 'Shaheen, Marwan', 'Brandwein, Joseph M', 'Pitcher, Bethany', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Yee, Karen W L', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Schuh, Andre C']","['Deotare U', 'Shaheen M', 'Brandwein JM', 'Pitcher B', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Yee KWL', 'Schimmer A', 'Minden MD', 'Gupta V', 'Schuh AC']","['Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Pathobiology and Laboratory Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/09/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2341 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):810-813. doi: 10.1002/hon.2341.

When bone marrow (BM) cells were cocultured with mitomycin C-treated Med1(+/+) MEFs, or OP-9 or MS-5 BM stromal cells, in the presence of anti-POSTN antibody, the growth of BM cells and number of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) were attenuated. When BM cells were cocultured with Med1(-/-) MEFs in the presence of recombinant POSTN, the growth of BM cells and the number of LTC-ICs were restored. Moreover, antibody-mediated blockage of stromal cells-derived POSTN markedly reduced the growth and cobblestone formation, a leukemic stem cell feature, of stromal cell-dependent MB-1 myeloblastoma cells. POSTN was expressed both in BM cells and variably in different BM stromal cells. Expression in the latter cells was increased by physical interaction with hematopoietic cells. The receptor for POSTN, integrin alphavbeta3, was expressed abundantly in BM stromal cells. The addition of recombinant POSTN to BM stromal cells induced intracellular signaling downstream of integrin alphavbeta3. These results suggest that stromal cell POSTN supports both normal HPCs and leukemia-initiating cells in vitro, at least in part, indirectly by acting on stromal cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner.","['Tanaka, Satowa', 'Maekawa, Akio', 'Matsubara, Leo', 'Imanishi, Azusa', 'Yano, Masaya', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Hasegawa, Natsumi', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Ito, Mitsuhiro']","['Tanaka S', 'Maekawa A', 'Matsubara L', 'Imanishi A', 'Yano M', 'Roeder RG', 'Hasegawa N', 'Asano S', 'Ito M']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan.', 'Research Organization for Nano & Life Innovation, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Okubo, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 159-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Division of Medical Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 7-10-2 Tomogaoka, Suma-ku, Kobe 654-0142, Japan; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA; Research Organization for Nano & Life Innovation, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Okubo, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 159-8555, Japan.

Several clinical studies have confirmed that specific BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors alter the physiological process of bone tissue in a complex and unclearly identified manner. Since these treatments are being given to more and more patients, and the therapy takes decades or lasts even lifelong, it is justifiable to obtain more detailed knowledge of the molecular background of these mechanisms. In this article the authors summarize preliminary research results and human clinical observations on imatinib and nilotinib which are related to bone metabolism, and present the results of their own experiments in in vitro osteoblast cultures. Based on the presented results, the effects of imatinib and nilotinib on bone cells depend on the concentration of imatinib and nilotinib, the maturation stage of the cells and the distribution ratio of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. In this study the authors firstly prepared a stop-gap, comprehensive review in the Hungarian literature, regarding the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on bone metabolism. In addition they firstly performed whole transcriptome analysis on osteoblasts in order to obtain a better understanding of the cellular molecular mechanisms. Orv.

Using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, well-balanced pairs of different variables can be compared effectively. We retrospectively compared allo-HSCT recipients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia receiving a RIC regimen (FBT200; fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 2 days, and total body irradiation [TBI] 200 cGy) or MAC regimen (FBT400; fludarabine 50 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and TBI 400 cGy). A total of 248 patients (121 in the RIC group and 127 in the MAC group) were included in the analysis. No statistically significant difference was observed in 2-year OS (RIC group, 45.2 +/- 5.0%; MAC group, 51.7 +/- 5.2%; P = .541), nonrelapse mortality (NRM; RIC group, 28.7 +/- 2.8% MAC group, 34.7 +/- 4.6%; P = .368), and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P = .171) or chronic GVHD (P = .605) at 1 year. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 2 years was statistically significantly different between the 2 groups, however (RIC, 26.1 +/- 2.6%; MAC, 14.2 +/- 3.5%; P = .033).

In contrast to other forms of AML, CD34 expression is not an unfavorable prognostic factor in NPM1m AML, neither at diagnosis nor at relapse.","['Junca, Jordi', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Garcia-Caro, Montse', 'Vila, Jordi', 'Zamora, Lurdes', 'Cabezon, Marta', 'Alonso, Esther', 'de la Banda, Esmeralda', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez, Ines', 'Ribera, Josep Maria', 'Milla, Fuensanta']","['Junca J', 'Garcia O', 'Garcia-Caro M', 'Vila J', 'Zamora L', 'Cabezon M', 'Alonso E', 'de la Banda E', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez I', 'Ribera JM', 'Milla F']","[""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain. jjunca@iconcologia.net."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", 'Hematology Laboratory, Hospital de Bellvitge, Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona), Spain.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Hospital de Bellvitge, Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona), Spain.', ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain."", ""Hematology Laboratory/Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160905,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/11/04 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/09/07 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2811-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2811-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Dec;95(12):1949-1954. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2811-y.

We estimated the expected cost-effectiveness and resources required for its implementation compared to conventional-NACT. METHODS: A Markov model compared costs, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and costs/QALY of RG-NACT vs. conventional-NACT, from a hospital perspective over a 5-year time horizon. Health services required for and health outcomes of implementation were estimated via resource modelling analysis, considering a current (4 %) and a full (100 %) implementation scenario. RESULTS: RG-NACT was expected to be more effective and less costly than conventional NACT in both implementation scenarios, with 94 % (current) and 95 % (full) certainty, at a willingness to pay threshold of euro20.000/QALY. Fully implementing RG-NACT in the Dutch target population of 6306 patients requires additional 5335 MRI examinations and an (absolute) increase in the number of MRI technologists, by 3.6 fte (full-time equivalent), and of breast radiologists, by 0.4 fte. On the other hand, it prevents 9 additional relapses, 143 cancer deaths, 23 congestive heart failure events and 2 myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia events. CONCLUSION: Considering cost-effectiveness, RG-NACT is expected to dominate conventional-NACT. While personnel capacity is likely to be sufficient for a full implementation scenario, MRI utilization needs to be intensified.","['Miquel-Cases, Anna', 'Steuten, Lotte M G', 'Rigter, Lisanne S', 'van Harten, Wim H']","['Miquel-Cases A', 'Steuten LM', 'Rigter LS', 'van Harten WH']","['Department of Psychosocial Research and Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam, 1066 CX, The Netherlands.', 'Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., P.O.

The presence of pneumoperitoneum in the presence of PI can present a therapeutic dilemma. The aim of our study was to review our experience and management of this condition. Methods A single-center retrospective study of consecutive children (> 1 year) presenting with a pneumoperitoneum and evidence of PI (2009-2015). Demographics, case notes, microbiology, and imaging were reviewed. Results Seven patients were identified (four males; age range 5-14 years). Four children had global developmental delay and were percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or jejunostomy fed, one was immunocompromised (acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The others had encephalitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. One patient proceeded to an exploratory laparotomy; no perforation was identified, pneumatosis of the colon was observed, and a loop ileostomy was formed. The remaining six were managed conservatively and made nil by mouth with intravenous antibiotics commenced. Five of the six had a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed PI and free air with no other worrying signs. One died from nongastrointestinal causes, while the remaining five had feeds reintroduced uneventfully. Conclusion Free air in the setting of PI may represent rupture of the gas cysts and not always transmural perforation. Surgery may not always be indicated and conservative management may suffice. A CT scan can be useful for excluding other intra-abdominal pathological findings and continued clinical assessment is essential.","['Galea, Julie', 'Burnand, Katherine M', 'Dawson, Fiona L', 'Sinha, Chandrasen K', 'Rex, Dean', 'Okoye, Bruce O']","['Galea J', 'Burnand KM', 'Dawson FL', 'Sinha CK', 'Rex D', 'Okoye BO']","[""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, St George's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20160905,United States,Eur J Pediatr Surg,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

METHODS: Seventy-three adolescent ALL patients participated in an open, controlled clinical trial and were randomized into a nurse-led management model group (n=36) and a doctor-led management model group (n=37). Two assessment questionnaires were administered to assess and compare the 2 models during a 1.5-year follow-up period: the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) questionnaire was administered at 6 different time points, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) at 3 different time points. RESULTS: There were no differences in anxiety and depression between the groups according to the first-administered questionnaire (the mean anxiety and depression scores of the nurse-led group were 14.2+/-4.1 and 10.8+/-2.7, respectively; those of the doctor-led group were 13.8+/-3.8 and 10.6+/-2.2, respectively). However, repeated measures analysis of variance detected differences in subsequent HADS-based scores as a function of time between the 2 groups (p<0.05). Moreover, the Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons tests showed that patients of the nurse-led group had significantly decreased mean anxiety scores compared to those in the doctor-led group at the third and subsequent sessions, as well as in mean depression scores from the second session onwards (all p<0.05). According to the last-administered EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, there were statistical differences in cognitive, emotional, social, and quality of life scales between the 2 groups (all p<0.05), but not in role and physical scales (all p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to offer unique cognitive, psychological, and behavioral management models to adolescent ALL patients that are tailored toward their age group. Strengthening such management is more conducive to alleviating or even reversing psychological problems, and to improving patients' quality of life while ensuring complication-free follow-up periods.","['Lin, Hailong', 'Zhou, Shiyan', 'Zhang, Dongxiu', 'Huang, Leting']","['Lin H', 'Zhou S', 'Zhang D', 'Huang L']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

However, studies between the relationship of PTB and the risk of acute childhood leukemia have yielded inconclusive results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically review the current literature to investigate whether PTB is associated with increased risk of acute childhood leukemia. METHODS: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE) were searched up to December 1st, 2015. Relevant studies reporting the association between PTB and subsequent risk of acute childhood leukemia were included for further evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using Revmen 5.3 and Stata 10.0. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies for acute childhood leukemia, eight studies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and seven studies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included in the current meta-analyses. We calculated pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the relationship between PTB and acute childhood leukemia as well as its two subtypes: ALL and AML. Our results suggested that PTB was significantly associated with increased risk of acute childhood leukemia (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.17, P = 0.01) and AML (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.21-1.67, P < 0.01). However, PTB was not significantly associated with an increased risk of ALL (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.96-1.13, P = 0.29). CONCLUSION: Our data showed that PTB increased the risk of AML. Further studies are required to explore causality and dissect the biological mechanisms involved.","['Huang, Qi-Tao', 'Gao, Yun-Fei', 'Zhong, Mei', 'Yu, Yan-Hong']","['Huang QT', 'Gao YF', 'Zhong M', 'Yu YH']","['Division of Obstetrics And Gynecology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20160905,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Aging/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000447828 [pii]', '10.1159/000447828 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2016;39(3):1229-38. doi: 10.1159/000447828.

The relative improvement in the survival rate in AYAs has not kept pace with that achieved in younger children, especially for acute leukemia, non-HLs, Ewing tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma. Etiological factors are under-researched and remain largely hypothetical. In this unique group of illnesses, improving AYA cancer management involves bridging interfaces. Since this has begun, outcomes have also begun to improve. The local nature of these interfaces determines the age group considered as AYA.

Here we used aryl boronic acid carbonyl warheads to covalently target a noncatalytic lysine side chain, and generated to our knowledge the first reversible covalent inhibitors for Mcl-1, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) target that has proven difficult to inhibit via traditional medicinal chemistry strategies. These covalent binders exhibited improved potency in comparison to noncovalent congeners, as demonstrated in biochemical and cell-based assays.

Herein, we determined the prognostic significance of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with CLL Methods: A retrospective cohort study reviewing the records of 107 consecutive treatment naive patients with CLL and a control group comprised of apparently healthy individuals attending for periodic health examinations. RESULTS: The median CRP level of patients with CLL was 0.19 mg/dL (0-2.9). In univariate analysis, high-CRP levels (>/=0.4 mg/dL) were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR = 3.97, 95%CI 1.64-9.62, p = .002) and development of second solid cancers (HR = 4.54, 95%CI 1.57-13.11, p = .005), compared to low-CRP values (<0.4 mg/dL). In multivariate analysis, high-CRP retained statistical significance for all-cause mortality (HR = 2.81, 95%CI 1.04-7.57, p = .04) and the development of second solid malignancies (HR = 4.54, 95%CI 1.57-13.11, p = .005). Moreover, when compared to an apparently healthy population, CLL patients with high CRP levels had more than an eightfold risk of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated baseline CRP levels are associated with shorter survival and development of second cancers in patients with CLL. We suggest that increased CRP in patients with CLL may justify a more rigorous search for second cancers. KEY MESSAGES Elevated CRP levels are associated with a shorter overall survival in CLL. Elevated CRP levels are associated with an increased risk of second cancers in CLL. Increased CRP in patients with CLL may justify a more rigorous search for second cancers.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Shenhar-Tsarfaty, Shani', 'Weinberger, Ronit', 'Gelman, Ram', 'Ziv-Baran, Tomer', 'Zeltser, David', 'Shapira, Itzhak', 'Berliner, Sholomo', 'Rogowski, Ori']","['Herishanu Y', 'Polliack A', 'Shenhar-Tsarfaty S', 'Weinberger R', 'Gelman R', 'Ziv-Baran T', 'Zeltser D', 'Shapira I', 'Berliner S', 'Rogowski O']","['a The Department of Hematology , Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'c Hebrew University Medical School , Jerusalem , Israel.', 'd Internal Medicine ""C"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'e Internal Medicine ""E"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'f The Immunology Laboratory at Clalit Health Services , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'e Internal Medicine ""E"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'g The Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine , School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'h Internal Medicine ""D"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'e Internal Medicine ""E"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'b Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel-Aviv , Israel.', 'd Internal Medicine ""C"" Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161103,England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/complications/*metabolism', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival']",,,2016/11/04 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07853890.2016.1232860 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2017 Feb;49(1):75-82. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2016.1232860.

We conducted a prospective multicenter cohort study (Leucemie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent cohort) to determine the prevalence and risk factors of IO in 384 acute leukemia survivors transplanted during childhood. Prevalence of IO (ferritin level 350 ng/mL) was 42.2% (95%CI 37.2-47.2%). Factors significantly associated with IO were: 1) in univariate analysis: older age at transplant (P<0.001), allogeneic versus autologous transplantation (P<0.001), radiation-based preparative regimen (P=0.035) and recent period of transplantation (P<0.001); 2) in multivariate analysis: older age at transplant in quartiles (Odds Ratio (OR)=7.64, 95% CI: 3.73-15.64 for age >12.7 years and OR=5.36, 95% CI: 2.63-10.95 for age from 8.2 to 12.7 years compared to age < 4.7 years), acute myeloid leukemia (OR=3.23, 95% CI: 1.47-7.13), allogeneic graft (OR=4.34, 95% CI: 2.07-9.12 for alternative donors and OR=2.53, 95% CI: 1.2-5.33 for siblings, compared to autologous graft) and radiation-based conditioning regimen (OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.09-5.53). Graft-versus-host disease was an additional risk factor for allogeneic graft recipients. In conclusion, IO is a frequent complication in pediatric long-term survivors after transplantation for acute leukemia, more frequently observed in older children, those transplanted from alternative donors or with graft-versus-host disease.","['Sirvent, A', 'Auquier, P', 'Oudin, C', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Bohrer, S', 'Chastagner, P', 'Poiree, M', 'Kanold, J', 'Thouvenin, S', 'Perel, Y', 'Plantaz, D', 'Tabone, M-D', 'Yakouben, K', 'Gandemer, V', 'Lutz, P', 'Sirvent, N', 'Vercasson, C', 'Berbis, J', 'Chambost, H', 'Leverger, G', 'Baruchel, A', 'Michel, G']","['Sirvent A', 'Auquier P', 'Oudin C', 'Bertrand Y', 'Bohrer S', 'Chastagner P', 'Poiree M', 'Kanold J', 'Thouvenin S', 'Perel Y', 'Plantaz D', 'Tabone MD', 'Yakouben K', 'Gandemer V', 'Lutz P', 'Sirvent N', 'Vercasson C', 'Berbis J', 'Chambost H', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Michel G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', 'Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Aix-Marseille University and Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Aix-Marseille University and Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Timone Enfants Hospital and Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hopital d'Enfants de Brabois, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital L'Archet, Nice, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Saint Etienne, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology- Immunology, Robert Debre Hospital, and Paris Diderot University, Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-oncology, Hospital University, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', 'Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Aix-Marseille University and Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Aix-Marseille University and Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Timone Enfants Hospital and Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology- Immunology, Robert Debre Hospital, and Paris Diderot University, Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France.', 'Research Unit EA 3279 and Department of Public Health, Aix-Marseille University and Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Timone Enfants Hospital and Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160905,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Allografts', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/*blood/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016205 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.205 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Jan;52(1):80-87. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.205.

This study investigated the long-term effect of adding bendamustine to a conditioning regimen on survival, rate of engraftment, immune recovery and GvHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in CLL patients. These outcomes were compared with the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) conditioning regimen. We reviewed the data for 89 CLL patients treated on three trials at our institution. Twenty-six (29%) patients received bendamustine, fludarabine and rituximab (BFR) and 63 (71%) received FCR. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. Ten (38%) BFR-treated patients vs only two (3%) FCR-treated patients did not experience severe neutropenia (P=<0.001). The 3-year overall survival estimates for the BFR and FCR groups were 82 and 51% (P=0.03), and the 3-year PFS estimates were 63% and 27% (P=0.001), respectively. The 2-year treatment-related mortality was 8 and 23% and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 GvHD was 4% and 10%, respectively.

There are few studies that report the incidence of nosocomial infections in patients with HM. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and clinical course of NP in a cohort of patients with hematologic malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center study of patients with leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma diagnosed with NP, hospitalized between January 2011 and December 2012. RESULTS: One-hundred and five NP were recorded: 51 leukemias (48%) and 45 lymphomas (43%); 50 (48%) were in relapse or progression. Median days for NP development were 13 days (IQ 6-20). Sixty percent of the patients had severe neutropenia. The most frequent symptom was fever 73 (70%). CT scan showed infiltrates in 100% of cases; 45 (43%) with findings suggestive of invasive fungal infection. Seven (7%) had confirmed invasive fungal infection, possible 9 (9%) and 45 (43%) probable. There were 99 cultures taken, 30 blood cultures (67% were positive) and 31 sputum (71% positive). Sixty percent of Gramnegative bacteria were multi-drug resistant and 50% of the Grampositive, E. coli, 19 (30%) was the most frequent isolated, Aspergillus spp. was the third, but the one with the highest associated mortality. Attributable mortality for pneumonia was 50% and 73% in patients that required mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a high mortality rate in patients with HM and NP. Standardized diagnostic routes are needed for patients with HM with suspicion of pneumonia. Novel diagnostic techniques to enhance Aspergillus and respiratory viruses diagnosis should be introduced in this setting.","['Martinez-Hernandez, Lucia', 'Vilar-Compte, Diana', 'Cornejo-Juarez, Patricia', 'Volkow-Fernandez, Patricia']","['Martinez-Hernandez L', 'Vilar-Compte D', 'Cornejo-Juarez P', 'Volkow-Fernandez P']","['Departamento de Infectologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Infectologia, Hospital Espanol de Mexico (adscripcion actual), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Infectologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Infectologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Infectologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Gac Med Mex,Gaceta medica de Mexico,0010333,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/mortality', 'Lymphoma/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/mortality', 'Pneumonia/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Respiration, Artificial/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gac Med Mex. 2016 Jul-Aug;152(4):465-72.,,,,,,,,,,,Neumonia nosocomial (NN) en pacientes con neoplasias hematologicas (NH).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CEACAM6 is normally expressed on the surface of myeloid (CD66c) and epithelial surfaces. Stiochiomertic expression of members of the CEA family (CEACAM1, 5, 6, 7) on epithelia maintains normal tissue architecture through homo-and hetero-philic interactions. Dysregulated over-expression of CEACAM6 is oncogenic, is associated with anoikis resistance and an invasive phenotype mediated by excessive TGFbeta, AKT, FAK and SRC signaling in human malignancies. METHODS: Extensive literature review through PubMed was conducted to identify relevant preclinical and clinical research publications regarding CEACAM6 over the last decade and was summarized in this manuscript. RESULTS: CEACAM5 and 6 are over-expressed in nearly 70% of epithelial malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), hepatobiliary, gastric, breast, non-small cell lung and head/neck cancers. Importantly, CEACAM6 is a poor prognostic marker in CRC, while its expression correlates with tumor stage, metastasis and post-operative survival in PDA. CEACAM6 appears to be an immune checkpoint suppressor in hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments targeting CEACAM6 have been designed and developed as a targeted therapy for human malignancies. A Llama antibody targeting CEACAM6 is being evaluated in early phase clinical trials. CONCLUSION: This review focuses on the role of CEACAM6 in the pathogenesis and signaling of the malignant phenotype in solid and hematologic malignancies and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapy.","['Johnson, Benny', 'Mahadevan, Daruka']","['Johnson B', 'Mahadevan D']","['The University of Tennessee Health Science Center & West Cancer Center, Memphis, TN,USA.', 'The University of Tennessee Health Science Center & West Cancer Center, Memphis, TN,USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Clin Cancer Drugs,Clinical cancer drugs,101679754,,,PMC4997943,,2015/02/01 00:00,2015/02/01 00:01,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2174/2212697X02666150602215823 [doi]', 'CCD-2-100 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Drugs. 2015 Feb;2(2):100-111. doi: 10.2174/2212697X02666150602215823.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'CEACAM6', 'FAK', 'IGF-1R', 'SRC', 'TGFb', 'anoikis resistance', 'cell adhesion', 'therapeutic antibodies', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the molecular background underlying progression is still largely unexplored even though ASXL1, IDH1/2, SRSF2, and TP53 mutations, together with adverse karyotypic changes, place the patient at high risk of leukemic transformation. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient, a 64-year old man with a diagnosis of JAK2 (V617F) primary myelofibrosis (PMF) had an unusually rapid leukemic transformation. Genomic profiling showed that TET2 and SRSF2 mutations were also present. At leukemic transformation, the patient developed a complex chromosome rearrangement producing a EWSR1-MYB fusion. Remarkably, the expression of MYB and of its target BCL2 was, respectively, >/=4.7 and >/=2.8 fold higher at leukemic transformation than after chemotherapy, when the patient obtained the hematological remission. At this time point, the EWSR1-MYB fusion disappeared while JAK2 (V617F), TET2, and SRSF2 mutations, as well as PMF morphological features persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid leukemic transformation of JAK2 (V617F) PMF was closely linked to a previously undescribed putative EWSR1-MYB transcription factor which was detected only at disease evolution. We hypothesize that the EWSR1-MYB contributed to leukemia transformation through at least two mechanisms: 1) it sustained MYB expression, and consequently deregulated its target BCL2, a putative onco-suppressor gene; and 2) ectopic EWSR1-MYB expression probably fulfilled its own oncogenic potential as demonstrated for other MYB-fusions. As our study confirmed that MYB is recurrently involved in chronic as well as leukemic transformation of PMF, it appears to be a valid molecular marker for tailored treatments.","['Pierini, Tiziana', 'Di Giacomo, Danika', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Lema Fernandez, Anair Graciela', 'Pellanera, Fabrizia', 'Iannotti, Tamara', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Pierini T', 'Di Giacomo D', 'Pierini V', 'Gorello P', 'Barba G', 'Lema Fernandez AG', 'Pellanera F', 'Iannotti T', 'Falzetti F', 'La Starza R', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, C.R.E.O., Piazzale Menghini n.9, 06132 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160901,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,PMC5009546,,2016/09/07 06:00,2016/09/07 06:01,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-016-0277-1 [doi]', '277 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2016 Sep 1;9(1):68. doi: 10.1186/s13039-016-0277-1. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemic transformation', 'MYB', 'PMF']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities in composition and function of hematopoietic niches have been proposed as key contributors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) progression. Our previous experimental findings strongly suggest that pro-inflammatory cues contribute to mesenchymal niche abnormalities that result in maintenance of ALL precursor cells at the expense of normal hematopoiesis. Here, we propose a molecular regulatory network interconnecting the major communication pathways between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within the BM. Dynamical analysis of the network as a Boolean model reveals two stationary states that can be interpreted as the intercellular contact status. Furthermore, simulations describe the molecular patterns observed during experimental proliferation and activation. Importantly, our model predicts instability in the CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 interactions following microenvironmental perturbation due by temporal signaling from Toll like receptors (TLRs) ligation. Therefore, aberrant expression of NF-kappaB induced by intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute to create a tumor microenvironment where a negative feedback loop inhibiting CXCR4/CXCL12 and VLA4/VCAM1 cellular communication axes allows for the maintenance of malignant cells.","['Enciso, Jennifer', 'Mayani, Hector', 'Mendoza, Luis', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Enciso J', 'Mayani H', 'Mendoza L', 'Pelayo R']","['Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social SecurityMexico City, Mexico; Biochemistry Sciences Program, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MexicoMexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Biotecnologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,PMC4990565,,2016/09/07 06:00,2016/09/07 06:01,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2016/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2016.00349 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2016 Aug 19;7:349. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2016.00349. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL12', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer systems biology', 'dynamical systems', 'early hematopoiesis', 'network modeling', 'pro-inflammatory bone marrow', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that rabbit epiblast cells can be coaxed toward different types of pluripotent stem cells and reveal the dynamics of pluripotent states in rabbit ESCs.","['Osteil, Pierre', 'Moulin, Anais', 'Santamaria, Claire', 'Joly, Thierry', 'Jouneau, Luc', 'Aubry, Maxime', 'Tapponnier, Yann', 'Archilla, Catherine', 'Schmaltz-Panneau, Barbara', 'Lecardonnel, Jerome', 'Barasc, Harmonie', 'Mouney-Bonnet, Nathalie', 'Genthon, Clemence', 'Roulet, Alain', 'Donnadieu, Cecile', 'Acloque, Herve', 'Gocza, Elen', 'Duranthon, Veronique', 'Afanassieff, Marielle', 'Savatier, Pierre']","['Osteil P', 'Moulin A', 'Santamaria C', 'Joly T', 'Jouneau L', 'Aubry M', 'Tapponnier Y', 'Archilla C', 'Schmaltz-Panneau B', 'Lecardonnel J', 'Barasc H', 'Mouney-Bonnet N', 'Genthon C', 'Roulet A', 'Donnadieu C', 'Acloque H', 'Gocza E', 'Duranthon V', 'Afanassieff M', 'Savatier P']","[""Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France; INRA, USC1361, 69500 Bron, France; Embryology Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, CMRI, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", 'Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France.', ""ISARA-Lyon, 69007 Lyon, France; VetAgroSup, UPSP ICE, 69280 Marcy l'Etoile, France."", 'UMR BDR, INRA, ENVA, Universite Paris-Saclay, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France.', 'UMR BDR, INRA, ENVA, Universite Paris-Saclay, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France.', 'UMR BDR, INRA, ENVA, Universite Paris-Saclay, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France.', 'GABI, INRA, AgroParisTech, Universite Paris-Saclay, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France.', 'INRA, UMR 444, Genetique Cellulaire, 31076 Toulouse, France; ENVT, 31076 Toulouse, France.', 'INRA, UMR 444, Genetique Cellulaire, 31076 Toulouse, France; ENVT, 31076 Toulouse, France.', ""INRA, UMR1388 Genetique, Physiologie et Systemes d'Elevage, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France."", ""INRA, UMR1388 Genetique, Physiologie et Systemes d'Elevage, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France."", ""INRA, UMR1388 Genetique, Physiologie et Systemes d'Elevage, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France."", ""INRA, UMR1388 Genetique, Physiologie et Systemes d'Elevage, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France."", 'NARIC, Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, 2100 Godollo, Hungary.', 'UMR BDR, INRA, ENVA, Universite Paris-Saclay, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute U1208, 69500 Bron, France; INRA, USC1361, 69500 Bron, France.

It was reported that the patient had abdominal pain, and permanent bloody and mucous diarrhea (8-10 times a day) was present for almost 1 week after the beginning of ALL treatment. The second case was a 10-year-old boy diagnosed with depression. The patient was brought to our hospital by his parents with complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, lack of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue persisting since 1 month in addition to headache, fear, sleeplessness, and waking up with cry. The third case was a 13-year-old boy who complained of abdominal pain, diarrhea (rare occasions), lack of appetite, and headache for 2 months. These patients had not traveled abroad. The cases were treated successfully with co-trimoxazole.

Yet the molecular events downstream of NOTCH1 that drive T-cell leukemogenesis remain incompletely understood. Starting from genome-wide gene-expression profiling to seek important NOTCH1 transcriptional targets, we identified DEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), which was previously shown to be important in multiple myeloma but remains functionally unclear in other hematological malignancies. Mechanistically, we demonstrated NOTCH1 directly bound to and activated the human DEPTOR promoter in T-ALL cells. DEPTOR depletion abolished cellular proliferation, attenuated glycolytic metabolism and enhanced cell death, while ectopically expressed DEPTOR significantly promoted cell growth and glycolysis. We further showed that DEPTOR depletion inhibited while its overexpression enhanced AKT activation in T-ALL cells. Importantly, AKT inhibition completely abrogated DEPTOR-mediated cell growth advantages. Moreover, DEPTOR depletion in a human T-ALL xenograft model significantly delayed T-ALL onset and caused a substantial decrease of AKT activation in leukemic blasts. We thus reveal a novel mechanism involved in NOTCH1-driven leukemogenesis, identifying the transcriptional control of DEPTOR and its regulation of AKT as additional key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH1.","['Hu, Y', 'Su, H', 'Liu, C', 'Wang, Z', 'Huang, L', 'Wang, Q', 'Liu, S', 'Chen, S', 'Zhou, J', 'Li, P', 'Chen, Z', 'Liu, H', 'Qing, G']","['Hu Y', 'Su H', 'Liu C', 'Wang Z', 'Huang L', 'Wang Q', 'Liu S', 'Chen S', 'Zhou J', 'Li P', 'Chen Z', 'Liu H', 'Qing G']","[""School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160905,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/09/07 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/09/06 06:00'],"['2015/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016275 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.275 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Feb 23;36(8):1038-1047. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.275.

Current intensive cytotoxic therapies can be associated with significant morbidity and novel therapies are needed to improve outcomes. Immunotherapy based approaches provide an alternative mechanism of action in the treatment of acute leukemia. Due to cell surface antigen expression, leukemia in particular is amenable to targeted therapies, such as antibody-based therapy. Based on the potential for non-overlapping toxicity, the possibility of synergistic action with standard chemotherapy, and by providing a novel method to overcome chemotherapy resistance, antibody-based therapies have shown potential for benefit. Modifications to standard monoclonal antibodies, including drug conjugation and linkage to T-cells, may further enhance efficacy of antibody-based therapies. Identifying the ideal timing for incorporation of antibody-based therapies, within standard regimens, may lead to improvement in overall outcomes.

A multivariable analysis identified phosphorylated CRE-binding protein as an independent survival factor with respect to clinical variables and Merkel cell polyomavirus status in our cohort of Merkel cell carcinoma patients.","['Gonzalez-Vela, Maria Del Carmen', 'Curiel-Olmo, Soraya', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Beltran, Sergi', 'Santibanez, Miguel', 'Martinez, Nerea', 'Castillo-Trujillo, Alfredo', 'Gut, Martha', 'Sanchez-Pacheco, Roxana', 'Almaraz, Carmen', 'Cereceda, Laura', 'Llombart, Beatriz', 'Agraz-Doblas, Antonio', 'Revert-Arce, Jose', 'Lopez Guerrero, Jose Antonio', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Marron, Pablo Isidro', 'Ortiz-Romero, Pablo', 'Fernandez-Cuesta, Lynnette', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Gut, Ivo', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo', 'Piris, Miguel Angel', 'Vaque, Jose Pedro']","['Gonzalez-Vela MDC', 'Curiel-Olmo S', 'Derdak S', 'Beltran S', 'Santibanez M', 'Martinez N', 'Castillo-Trujillo A', 'Gut M', 'Sanchez-Pacheco R', 'Almaraz C', 'Cereceda L', 'Llombart B', 'Agraz-Doblas A', 'Revert-Arce J', 'Lopez Guerrero JA', 'Mollejo M', 'Marron PI', 'Ortiz-Romero P', 'Fernandez-Cuesta L', 'Varela I', 'Gut I', 'Cerroni L', 'Piris MA', 'Vaque JP']","['Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain; Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri i Reixac 4, 08028, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri i Reixac 4, 08028, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universidad de Cantabria-IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri i Reixac 4, 08028, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain.', 'IBBTEC-UC-CSIC-SODERCAN Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Santander, Spain; Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Biobanco -Fundacion Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Biobanco-Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Dermatology Service, Instituto I+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC-WHO), Lyon, France; Department of Translational Genomics, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'IBBTEC-UC-CSIC-SODERCAN Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri i Reixac 4, 08028, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Dermatology Medical University of Graz, Austria.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain; Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Cancer Genomics Laboratory, Instituto de Investigacion Marques de Valdecilla, IDIVAL, Santander, Spain; IBBTEC-UC-CSIC-SODERCAN Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.

However, it is not well known whether arsenic trioxide is toxic to bone osteoblast cells, the precursor cells from which leukaemia cells originate. The aim of this study was to examine the response of osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and primary cultured osteoblasts to arsenic trioxide treatment. After 24h of treatment, arsenic trioxide was more effective at inhibiting cell growth and increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage in MG63 cells than in osteoblasts. In addition, arsenic trioxide arrested cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase, and induced apoptosis in MG63 cells, but not in primary cultured osteoblasts. The results further showed that the expression of transcription factor Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant effectors, including hemeoxygenase-1, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase, was increased in primary cultured osteoblasts. Additionally, expression of heat shock proteins was also increased. Experiments using inhibitors of antioxidant enzymes in the presence of arsenic trioxide-treated osteoblasts demonstrated that glutathione and superoxide dismutase were responsible for reducing oxidative stress, caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis and that heat shock proteins helped reduce caspase-3 activity. Unexpectedly, there was no apparent effect of the markedly increased hemeoxygenase-1, suggesting that other functions might exist for hemeoxygenase-1. These findings demonstrate that osteosarcoma cells are more sensitive to arsenic trioxide treatment than primary cultured osteoblasts and that primary cultured osteoblasts activate the Nrf2 signalling pathway in response to arsenic trioxide exposure to escape from oxidative damage and apoptosis.","['Chiu, Pu-Rong', 'Hu, Yu-Chen', 'Hsieh, Bau-Shan', 'Huang, Tzu-Ching', 'Cheng, Hsiao-Ling', 'Huang, Li-Wen', 'Chang, Kee-Lung']","['Chiu PR', 'Hu YC', 'Hsieh BS', 'Huang TC', 'Cheng HL', 'Huang LW', 'Chang KL']","['Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80756, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.

Treatment with AM markedly reduced the viability of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, chronic erythroleukemia HEL 92.1.7, and acute monoblastic leukemia U937 cells, but not normal human monocytes, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of K562 cells with AM caused changes characteristic of autophagy. Only a small amount of AM-treated K562 cells exhibited apoptosis. By contrast, AM treatment resulted in extensive apoptotic features in U937 and HEL 92.1.7 cells without evident autophagy. The autophagy of K562 cells induced by AM involved autophagic flux, including autophagosome induction, the processing of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and downregulation of BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3). By bcr-abl knockdown, the growth inhibition of K562 cells caused by AM was partially blocked, suggesting that AM-induced cell death might be a bcr-abl-dependent mode of autophagy-associated cell death. In conclusion, AM is capable of inhibiting growth and inducing autophagy-associated cell death in K562 cells, but not in normal monocytes. It may have potential to be developed as a novel therapeutic agent against leukemia.","['Chang, Wen-Han', 'Huang, Huey-Lan', 'Huang, Wei-Pang', 'Chen, Chien-Chih', 'Chen, Yu-Jen']","['Chang WH', 'Huang HL', 'Huang WP', 'Chen CC', 'Chen YJ']","['Institute of Traditional Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, 11221, Taiwan.', 'Department of Healthcare Center, MacKay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, 25173, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience Technology, College of Health Science, Chang Jung Christian University, Tainan, 71101, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science and Institute of Zoology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Hungkuang University, No.1018, Sec. 6, Taiwan Boulevard, Shalu Dist., Taichung City, 43302, Taiwan. ccchen@sunrise.hk.edu.tw.', 'Institute of Traditional Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, 11221, Taiwan. chenmdphd@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Research, MacKay Memorial Hospital, No.92, Section 2, Zhongshan N.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) was not detected in frozen-thawed ovarian tissue from 26 patients by any of the sensitive methods applied. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In case of leukemia, the risk of malignant cell transmission through the graft is well known and widely documented. However, for bone cancer, like Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma, only a small number of case reports, have been published. These cancers often affect prepubertal girls, in whom ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation is the only option to preserve fertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The presence of malignant cells in cryopreserved ovarian tissue from patients with bone/soft tissue sarcoma was investigated with disease-specific markers for each patient, using immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), with the original tumor serving as a positive control. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Forty-eight sarcoma patients were enrolled in the study, 12 of whom subsequently died. In each case, tissue from the primary tumor was investigated in order to identify markers (immunohistochemical and/or molecular) to analyze the ovarian tissue case by case. Ovarian tissue from osteosarcoma (n = 15), liposarcoma (n = 1) and undifferentiated sarcoma (n = 5) patients could not be evaluated, as no specific markers were detected by FISH or sensitive IHC in any of their primary tumoral tissue. One patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome was also excluded from the study. IHC analyses were therefore performed on ovarian tissue from 26 patients and qPCR on 19. The primary tumors involved were Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (n = 14), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 7), synovial sarcoma (n = 2), clear cell sarcoma (n = 2) and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (n = 1). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: MDD was not detected in any of the 26 analyzed samples using sensitive techniques in this largest reported series, even from patients who subsequently died and/or those who presented with metastasis (11/26), hence the most aggressive forms of bone cancer. Indeed, anti-CD99 IHC and PCR performed on patients presenting with Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (n = 14) was negative in all cases. In patients with soft tissue sarcoma (n = 12) primitive tumor markers were detected by IHC and were negative in ovarian tissue. PCR could only be performed in 6/12 of these patients, again proving negative. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Cryopreserved ovarian fragments to be transplanted cannot be tested, so this analysis of malignant cells cannot guarantee that all cryopreserved fragments will not contain any disseminated disease. Moreover, molecular markers are not readily available for all types of tumors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results are reassuring regarding the risk of malignant cells in the ovary for transplantation, as the study involves a large series including different types of sarcomas.

This is particularly problematic for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21.3. This region is associated with over 100 diseases, but variant calling is hindered by the extreme divergence across different haplotypes. RESULTS: We simulated reads from chromosome 6 exonic regions over a wide range of sequence divergence and coverage depth. We systematically assessed combinations between five mappers and five callers for their performance on simulated data and exome-seq data from NA12878, a well-studied individual in which multiple public call sets have been generated. Among those combinations, the number of known SNPs differed by about 5 % in the non-HLA regions of chromosome 6 but over 20 % in the HLA region. Notably, GSNAP mapping combined with GATK UnifiedGenotyper calling identified about 20 % more known SNPs than most existing methods without a noticeable loss of specificity, with 100 % sensitivity in three highly polymorphic HLA genes examined. Much larger differences were observed among these combinations in INDEL calling from both non-HLA and HLA regions. We obtained similar results with our internal exome-seq data from a cohort of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a workflow enabling variant detection, with high sensitivity and specificity, over the full spectrum of divergence seen in the human genome. Comparing to public call sets from NA12878 has highlighted the overall superiority of GATK UnifiedGenotyper, followed by GATK HaplotypeCaller and SAMtools, in SNP calling, and of GATK HaplotypeCaller and Platypus in INDEL calling, particularly in regions of high sequence divergence such as the HLA region. GSNAP and Novoalign are the ideal mappers in combination with the above callers. We expect that the proposed workflow should be applicable to variant discovery in other highly divergent regions.","['Tian, Shulan', 'Yan, Huihuang', 'Neuhauser, Claudia', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Tian S', 'Yan H', 'Neuhauser C', 'Slager SL']","['Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Informatics Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.

However, it may be possible to improve patient outcomes significantly by a better understanding of resistance mechanisms, which cancers rely upon during the evolution to an untreatable state. Here we report an essential role of the stem cell reprogramming factor, PBX1, in mediating chemoresistance in ovarian carcinomas. In the clinical setting, high levels of PBX1 expression correlated with shorter survival in post-chemotherapy ovarian cancer patients. In tumor cells with low endogenous levels of PBX1, its enforced expression promoted cancer stem cell-like phenotypes, including most notably an increase in resistance to platinum-based therapy used most commonly for treating this disease. Conversely, silencing PBX1 in platinum-resistant cells that overexpressed PBX1 sensitized them to platinum treatment and reduced their stem-like properties. An analysis of published genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data indicated that PBX1 binds directly to promoters of genes involved in stem cell maintenance and the response to tissue injury. We confirmed direct regulation of one of these genes, STAT3, demonstrating that the PBX1 binding motif at its promoter acted to positively regulate STAT3 transcription. We further demonstrated that a STAT3/JAK2 inhibitor could potently sensitize platinum-resistant cells to carboplatin and suppress their growth in vivo Our findings offer a mechanistic rationale to target the PBX1/STAT3 axis to antagonize a key mechanism of chemoresistance in ovarian cancers and possibly other human cancers.

The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic studies of the Am-Si@ZnO nanocomposite reveal that the nanoparticles have a microscopic structure comprising of hexagonal assemblies of ZnO with typical dimensions of 30 nm. The surface morphology of the LB multilayer observed by scanning electron microscopy shows uniform surface of the Am-Si@ZnO film in the nanometer range (<80 nm). These electrodes have been utilized for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) detection by covalently immobilizing the amino-terminated oligonucleotide probe sequence via glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. The response studies of these fabricated electrodes carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that this Am-Si@ZnO LB film based nucleic acid sensor exhibits a linear response to complementary DNA (10(-6)-10(-16) M) with a detection limit of 1 x 10(-16) M.

We found an overall greater mutational burden and more driver mutations in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. In addition, the majority of the mutations in T-ALL had occurred in the original leukemic clone, while most of the mutations in BCP-ALL were subclonal. BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse.

All patients were divided into five groups according to the age at the time of diagnosis (<1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-15, >15 years old). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate leukemia survival outcomes and risk factors. RESULTS: There was significant variability in pediatric leukemia survival by age at diagnosis including ALL, AML and CML subtypes. According to the survival curves in each group, survival rate were peaked among children diagnosed at 1-4 years and steadily declined among those diagnosed at older ages in children with ALL. Infants (<1 year) had the lowest survivorship in children with either ALL or AML. However, children (1-4 years) harbored the worst prognosis suffering from CML. A stratified analysis of the effect of age at diagnosis was validated as independent predictors for the prognosis of pediatric leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Age at diagnosis remained to be a crucial determinant of the survival variability of pediatric leukemia patients.","['Wang, Yaping', 'Huang, Jie', 'Rong, Liucheng', 'Wu, Peng', 'Kang, Meiyun', 'Zhang, Xuejie', 'Lu, Qin', 'Fang, Yongjun']","['Wang Y', 'Huang J', 'Rong L', 'Wu P', 'Kang M', 'Zhang X', 'Lu Q', 'Fang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC5347803,,2016/09/04 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/09/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['11765 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11765 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 13;7(50):83767-83774. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11765.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Kaplan-Meier', 'age', 'epidemiology', 'leukemia', 'surveillance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multifunctional POLRMT enzyme controls mitochondrial gene expression, a process required both for mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis. We further demonstrate that inhibition of this newly defined MYC effector pathway causes robust and selective tumor cell apoptosis, via an acute, checkpoint-like mechanism linked to aberrant electron transport chain complex assembly and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Fortuitously, MYC-dependent tumor cell death can be induced by inhibiting the mitochondrial gene expression pathway using a variety of strategies, including treatment with FDA-approved antibiotics. In vivo studies using a mouse model of Burkitt's Lymphoma provide pre-clinical evidence that these antibiotics can successfully block progression of MYC-dependent tumors.","['Oran, Amanda R', 'Adams,

The targeted therapy of BCR-ABL inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has provided the epitome for ""Ehlrich's magic bullet"" postulated decades ago. AREAS COVERED: Due to the therapy with these drugs, the survival of newly diagnosed patients with this disease now approaches that of age matched controls. Progression to advanced phases of CML had decreased over the years, though resistance has now been increasingly identified. Expert commentary: Ponatinib is a third generation TKI, which has shown to be effective in both early and advanced phases of CML and those bearing resistant mutations, specifically T315I. However, new side effect considerations need to be balanced with the efficacy, to establish the role of ponatinib in the therapy of CML.","['Poch Martell, Marc', 'Sibai, Hassan', 'Deotare, Uday', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Poch Martell M', 'Sibai H', 'Deotare U', 'Lipton JH']","['a Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.', 'a Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Comorbidity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/04 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/09/04 06:00'],"['2016/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/17474086.2016.1232163 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2016 Oct;9(10):923-32. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2016.1232163.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ponatinib', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desirable futility monitoring guidelines allow timely stopping if the new therapy is harmful or if it is unlikely to demonstrate to be sufficiently effective if the trial were to continue to its final analysis. There are a number of analytical approaches that are used to construct futility monitoring boundaries. The most common approaches are based on conditional power, sequential testing of the alternative hypothesis, or sequential confidence intervals. The resulting futility boundaries vary considerably with respect to the level of evidence required for recommending stopping the study. PURPOSE: We evaluate the performance of commonly used methods using event histories from completed phase III clinical trials of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, and North Central Cancer Treatment Group. METHODS: We considered published superiority phase III trials with survival endpoints initiated after 1990. There are 52 studies available for this analysis from different disease sites. Total sample size and maximum number of events (statistical information) for each study were calculated using protocol-specified effect size, type I and type II error rates. In addition to the common futility approaches, we considered a recently proposed linear inefficacy boundary approach with an early harm look followed by several lack-of-efficacy analyses. For each futility approach, interim test statistics were generated for three schedules with different analysis frequency, and early stopping was recommended if the interim result crossed a futility stopping boundary. For trials not demonstrating superiority, the impact of each rule is summarized as savings on sample size, study duration, and information time scales. RESULTS: For negative studies, our results show that the futility approaches based on testing the alternative hypothesis and repeated confidence interval rules yielded less savings (compared to the other two rules). These boundaries are too conservative, especially during the first half of the study (<50% of information). The conditional power rules are too aggressive during the second half of the study (>50% of information) and may stop a trial even when there is a clinically meaningful treatment effect. The linear inefficacy boundary with three or more interim analyses provided the best results. For positive studies, we demonstrated that none of the futility rules would have stopped the trials. CONCLUSION: The linear inefficacy boundary futility approach is attractive from statistical, clinical, and logistical standpoints in clinical trials evaluating new anti-cancer agents.","['Zhang, Qiang', 'Freidlin, Boris', 'Korn, Edward L', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Mandrekar, Sumithra', 'Dignam, James J']","['Zhang Q', 'Freidlin B', 'Korn EL', 'Halabi S', 'Mandrekar S', 'Dignam JJ']","['1 Statistics and Data Management Center, NRG Oncology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '2 Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '3 Biometric Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '3 Biometric Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '4 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', '5 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '1 Statistics and Data Management Center, NRG Oncology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '6 Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160922,England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,IM,"['Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', '*Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', '*Medical Futility', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Research Design']",PMC5300958,,2016/09/04 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2016/09/04 06:00'],"['2016/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['1740774516666502 [pii]', '10.1177/1740774516666502 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Trials. 2017 Feb;14(1):48-58. doi: 10.1177/1740774516666502.

Recent reports have shown stronger anti-leukemic activity but similar survival for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from matched sibling donor compared to autologous transplantation (auto-HSCT); however, there is scarcity of literature confronting auto-HSCT with allo-HSCT from unrelated donor (UD-HSCT), especially mismatched UD-HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcome of allogeneic transplantation from matched (10/10 UD-HSCT) or mismatched at a single HLA-locus unrelated donor (9/10 UD-HSCT) to autologous transplantation in patients with AML in first complete remission (CR1). A total of 2879 patients were included; 1202 patients received auto-HSCT, 1302 10/10 UD-HSCT, and 375 9/10 UD-HSCT. A propensity score-weighted analysis was conducted to control for disease risk imbalances between the groups. RESULTS: Matched 10/10 UD-HSCT was associated with the best leukemia-free survival (10/10 UD-HSCT vs auto-HSCT: HR 0.7, p = 0.0016). Leukemia-free survival was not statistically different between auto-HSCT and 9/10 UD-HSCT (9/10 UD-HSCT vs auto-HSCT: HR 0.8, p = 0.2). Overall survival was similar across the groups (10/10 UD-HSCT vs auto-HSCT: HR 0.98, p = 0.84; 9/10 UD-HSCT vs auto-HSCT: HR 1.1, p = 0.49). Notably, in intermediate-risk patients, OS was significantly worse for 9/10 UD-HSCT (9/10 UD-HSCT vs auto-HSCT: HR 1.6, p = 0.049), while it did not differ between auto-HSCT and 10/10 UD-HSCT (HR 0.95, p = 0.88). In favorable risk patients, auto-HSCT resulted in 3-year LFS and OS rates of 59 and 78 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in AML patients in CR1 lacking an HLA-matched sibling donor, 10/10 UD-HSCT significantly improves LFS, but this advantage does not translate in better OS compared to auto-HSCT. In intermediate-risk patients lacking a fully HLA-matched donor, auto-HSCT should be considered as a valid option, as better survival appears to be provided by auto-HSCT compared to mismatched UD-HSCT. Finally, auto-HSCT provided an encouraging outcome in patients with favorable risk AML.","['Saraceni, Francesco', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Tabrizi, Reza', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Wu, Depei', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Arcese, William', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Saraceni F', 'Labopin M', 'Gorin NC', 'Blaise D', 'Tabrizi R', 'Volin L', 'Cornelissen J', 'Cahn JY', 'Chevallier P', 'Craddock C', 'Wu D', 'Huynh A', 'Arcese W', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Polytechnic University of Marche-Ospedali Riuniti Ancona, Via Conca 71, 60126, Ancona, Italy. francesco.saraceni@libero.it.', 'ALWP-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'ALWP-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation et Therapie Cellulaire-Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'HUH, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Clinique Universitaire d'Hematologie CHU Grenoble, Grenoble, France."", ""Department D'Hematologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'CHU Department Hematologie, Hopital de Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Rome Transplant Network, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'ALWP-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'ALWP-EBMT Office, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160902,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Donors', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Propensity Score', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC5009662,,2016/09/04 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2016/09/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0314-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0314-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 2;9(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0314-x.,,,,,,"['Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European society for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation (EBMT)']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Allogeneic transplantation', '*Autologous transplantation', '*Matched (10/10) and mismatched (9/10) unrelated donor transplantation', '*Post-remission therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identify dasatinib as a potent inducer of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha mRNA. Dasatinib increased PGC-1alpha mRNA expression up to 6-fold in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, primary adipocytes, and epididymal white adipose tissue from lean and diet-induced obese mice. Importantly, gene expression translated into increased PGC-1alpha protein content analyzed in melanoma cells and isolated mitochondria from adipocytes. However, dasatinib treatment had adverse effect on glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. This correlated with increased hepatic PGC-1alpha expression and the gluconeogenesis genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. In conclusion, we show that dasatinib is a potent inducer of PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein in adipose tissue. However, despite beneficial effects of increased PGC-1alpha content in adipose tissue, dasatinib significantly impaired glucose tolerance in obese but not lean mice. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to show that dasatinib regulates PGC-1alpha and causes glucose intolerance in obese mice. This should be considered in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Sylow, Lykke', 'Long, Jonathan Z', 'Lokurkar, Isha A', 'Zeng, Xing', 'Richter, Erik A', 'Spiegelman, Bruce M']","['Sylow L', 'Long JZ', 'Lokurkar IA', 'Zeng X', 'Richter EA', 'Spiegelman BM']","['Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Section of Molecular Physiology (L.S., E.A.R.), Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark; and Department of Cell Biology (J.L., I.A.L., X.Z., B.M.S.), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160902,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adipocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Adipose Tissue/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blood Glucose/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Glucose-6-Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Obese', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (ATP)/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC5086530,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2016-1398 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2016 Nov;157(11):4184-4191. doi: 10.1210/en.2016-1398.

Several studies have linked viral infection to the modulation of ganglioside expression such as human T-lymphotropic virus to GD2 and simian virus 40 to GM3. Also, enhancement of the expression of GM2 on the cell membrane after cytomegalovirus infection has been reported. The objective of this study was to unveil the relationship between HSV-1 infection and the alteration of cellular ganglioside expression in neuronal and glial cell lines. In addition to these cell lines, several human tumor cell lines including astrocytoma cells, neuroblastoma cells, T-cell leukemia cells and kidney cells derived from normal human and monkey were infected with HSV-1 as well as HSV-2. To measure changes in ganglioside-related gene expressions and gangliosides levels in cells, quantitative PCR and glycosphingolipid-glycomic analysis were performed. Changes in gene expression of glycosyltransferases and sialyltransferases were observed in HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected cells, although with different trends. 39 glycosphingolipid-glycans were quantitatively analyzed. HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections resulted in changes in the total amount of gangliosides depending on the cell lines used and type of virus. Qualitative changes caused by each infection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were almost negligible.","['Miyaji, Kazuki', 'Furukawa, Jun-Ichi', 'Suzuki, Youichi', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Shinohara, Yasuro', 'Yuki, Nobuhiro']","['Miyaji K', 'Furukawa JI', 'Suzuki Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Shinohara Y', 'Yuki N']","['Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, 14 Medical Drive, 117599, Singapore.', 'Laboratory of Medical and Functional Glycomics, Graduate School of Advanced Life Science, and Frontier Research Center for Post-Genome Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0021, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, 14 Medical Drive, 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, 14 Medical Drive, 117599, Singapore.', 'Laboratory of Medical and Functional Glycomics, Graduate School of Advanced Life Science, and Frontier Research Center for Post-Genome Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0021, Japan.

Dimethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a more metabolically stable curcumin analog that was shown to induce the expression of promoter-methylated genes without reversing DNA methylation. Accordingly, co-treatment with DMC and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors could hypothetically enhance the re-expression of promoter-methylated tumor suppressor genes. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects and epigenetic changes associated with the combination of DMC and the DNMT inhibitor decitabine (DAC) in primary leukemia samples and cell lines. The combination demonstrated antagonistic cytotoxic effects and was minimally cytotoxic to primary leukemia cells. The combination did not affect the metabolic stability of DMC. Although the combination enhanced the downregulation of nuclear DNMT proteins, the hypomethylating activity of the combination was not increased significantly compared to DAC alone. On the other hand, the combination significantly increased H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) compared to the single agents near the promoter region of promoter-methylated genes. Furthermore, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA pyrosequencing of the chromatin-enriched H3K27Ac did not show any significant decrease in DNA methylation compared to other regions. Consequently, the enhanced induction of promoter-methylated genes by the combination compared to DAC alone is mediated by a mechanism that involves increased histone acetylation and not through potentiation of the DNA hypomethylating activity of DAC. Collectively, our results provide the mechanistic basis for further characterization of this combination in leukemia animal models and early phase clinical trials.","['Hassan, Hazem E', 'Keita, Jean-Arnaud', 'Narayan, Lawrence', 'Brady, Sean M', 'Frederick, Richard', 'Carlson, Samuel', 'C Glass, Karen', 'Natesan, Senthil', 'Buttolph, Thomm', 'Fandy, Tamer E']","['Hassan HE', 'Keita JA', 'Narayan L', 'Brady SM', 'Frederick R', 'Carlson S', 'C Glass K', 'Natesan S', 'Buttolph T', 'Fandy TE']","['a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Maryland , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'b Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy , Helwan University , Cairo , Egypt.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.', 'd Department of Experimental and Systems Pharmacology , Washington State University , Spokane , WA , USA.', 'e Department of Neurological Sciences , University of Vermont , Burlington , VT , USA.', 'c Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Albany College of Pharmacy (Vermont Campus) , Colchester , VT , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161101,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,,,PMC5094623,,2016/09/03 06:00,2016/09/03 06:01,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/03 06:01 [medline]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2016.1226452 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2016 Oct 2;11(10):740-749. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2016.1226452.

The coding sequence of the DNA damage response gene, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), is contained in this deletion. The residual ATM allele is frequently mutated, suggesting a relationship between gene function and clinical response. To investigate this possibility, we sought to develop and validate an assay for the function of ATM protein in these patients. SMC1 (structural maintenance of chromosomes 1) and KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) were found to be unique substrates of ATM kinase by immunoblot detection following ionizing radiation. Using a pool of eight fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative CLL samples as a standard, the phosphorylation of SMC1 and KAP1 from 46 del (11q22-23) samples was analyzed using normal mixture model-based clustering. This identified 13 samples (28%) that were deficient in ATM function. Targeted sequencing of the ATM gene of these samples, with reference to genomic DNA, revealed 12 somatic mutations and 15 germline mutations in these samples. No strong correlation was observed between ATM mutation and function. Therefore, mutation status may not be taken as an indicator of ATM function. Rather, a direct assay of the kinase activity should be used in the development of therapies.","['Jiang, Y', 'Chen, H-C', 'Su, X', 'Thompson, P A', 'Liu, X', 'Do, K-A', 'Wierda, W', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Jiang Y', 'Chen HC', 'Su X', 'Thompson PA', 'Liu X', 'Do KA', 'Wierda W', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160902,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28/metabolism']",PMC5056966,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201669 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.69 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Sep 2;6(9):e465. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.69.,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (structural maintenance of chromosome protein 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM28 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MXD1-MAX binds E-boxes. MXD1-MAX antagonizes the transcriptional activity of the MYC oncoprotein in most models. It has been reported that MYC overexpression leads to augmented RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, which is a relevant activity in MYC-mediated tumorigenesis. Here we describe that MXD1, but not MYC or MNT, localizes to the nucleolus in a wide array of cell lines derived from different tissues (carcinoma, leukemia) as well as in embryonic stem cells. MXD1 also localizes in the nucleolus of primary tissue cells as neurons and Sertoli cells. The nucleolar localization of MXD1 was confirmed by co-localization with UBF. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that MXD1 interacted with UBF and proximity ligase assays revealed that this interaction takes place in the nucleolus. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that MXD1 was bound in the transcribed rDNA chromatin, where it co-localizes with UBF, but also in the ribosomal intergenic regions. The MXD1 involvement in rRNA synthesis was also suggested by the nucleolar segregation upon rRNA synthesis inhibition by actinomycin D.

We describe a novel physical and functional interaction between the proteins, which requires the central zinc finger domain of Ikaros. The Ikaros-Foxp1 interaction is abolished by deletion of this region, which corresponds to the IK6 isoform that is commonly associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also identify the Gpr132 gene, which encodes the orphan G protein-coupled receptor G2A, as a novel target for Foxp1. Increased expression of Foxp1 enhanced Gpr132 transcription and caused cell cycle changes, including G2 arrest. Co-expression of wild-type Ikaros, but not IK6, displaced Foxp1 binding from the Gpr132 gene, reversed the increase in Gpr132 expression and inhibited G2 arrest. Analysis of primary ALL samples revealed a significant increase in GPR132 expression in IKZF1-deleted BCR-ABL negative patients, suggesting that levels of wild-type Ikaros may influence the regulation of G2A in B-ALL.

Here, we report that Second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac) mimetic-induced cell death is regulated by redox signaling. We show that RSL3, a glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (GPX) 4 inhibitor, or Erastin, an inhibitor of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, cooperate with the Smac mimetic BV6 to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Addition of the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) fails to rescue ROS-induced cell death, demonstrating that RSL3/BV6- or Erastin/BV6-induced cell death occurs in a caspase-independent manner. Interestingly, the iron chelator Deferoxamine (DFO) significantly inhibits RSL3/BV6-induced cell death, whereas it is unable to rescue cell death by Erastin/BV6, showing that RSL3/BV6-, but not Erastin/BV6-mediated cell death depends on iron. ROS production is required for both RSL3/BV6- and Erastin/BV6-induced cell death, since the ROS scavenger alpha-tocopherol (alpha-Toc) rescues RSL3/BV6- and Erastin/BV6-induced cell death. By comparison, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of lipid peroxidation by GPX4 overexpression or ferrostatin (Fer)-1 significantly decreases RSL3/BV6-, but not Erastin/BV6-induced cell death, despite inhibition of lipid peroxidation upon exposure to RSL3/BV6 or Erastin/BV6. Of note, inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Fer-1 protects from RSL3/BV6-, but not from Erastin/BV6-stimulated ROS production, indicating that other forms of ROS besides lipophilic ROS occur during Erastin/BV6-induced cell death. Taken together, RSL3/BV6 and Erastin/BV6 differentially regulate redox signaling and cell death in ALL cells. While RSL3/BV6 cotreatment induces ferroptotic cell death, Erastin/BV6 stimulates oxidative cell death independently of iron. These findings have important implications for the therapeutic targeting of redox signaling to enhance Smac mimetic-induced cell death in ALL.","['Dachert, Jasmin', 'Schoeneberger, Hannah', 'Rohde, Katharina', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Dachert J', 'Schoeneberger H', 'Rohde K', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carbolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5325403,,2016/09/03 06:00,2018/04/06 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['11687 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11687 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 27;7(39):63779-63792. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11687.,,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carbolines)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RSL3 compound)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (erastin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ROS', 'Smac mimetic', 'cell death', 'ferroptosis', 'redox']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we identified RAS mutations in 14-24% of infant ALL patients, and showed that the presence of a RAS mutation decreased the survival chances even further. We hypothesized that targeting the RAS signaling pathway could be a therapeutic strategy for RAS-mutant infant ALL patients. Here we show that the MEK inhibitors Trametinib, Selumetinib and MEK162 severely impair primary RAS-mutant MLL-rearranged infant ALL cells in vitro. While all RAS-mutant samples were sensitive to MEK inhibitors, we found both sensitive and resistant samples among RAS-wildtype cases. We confirmed enhanced RAS pathway signaling in RAS-mutant samples, but found no apparent downstream over-activation in the wildtype samples. However, we did confirm that MEK inhibitors reduced p-ERK levels, and induced apoptosis in the RAS-mutant MLL-rearranged ALL cells. Finally, we show that MEK inhibition synergistically enhances prednisolone sensitivity, both in RAS-mutant and RAS-wildtype cells. In conclusion, MEK inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for MLL-rearranged ALL patients harboring RAS mutations, while patients without RAS mutations may benefit through prednisolone sensitization.","['Kerstjens, Mark', 'Driessen, Emma M C', 'Willekes, Merel', 'Pinhancos, Sandra S', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Kerstjens M', 'Driessen EM', 'Willekes M', 'Pinhancos SS', 'Schneider P', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",PMC5362448,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['11730 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11730 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 28;8(9):14835-14846. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11730.,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MEK inhibitors', 'MLL-rearrangements', 'RAS-pathway', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to obtain further insight into CATS function we performed an extensive analysis of CATS expression during differentiation of leukemia cell lines. While CATS expression decreased during erythroid, megakaryocytic and monocytic differentiation, a markedly increase was observed in the ATRA induced granulocytic differentiation. Lentivirus mediated silencing of CATS in U937 cell line resulted in somewhat reduced proliferation, altered cell cycle progression and lower migratory ability in vitro; however was not sufficient to inhibit tumor growth in xenotransplant model. Of note, CATS knockdown resulted in reduced clonogenicity of CATS-silenced cells and reduced expression of the self-renewal gene, GLI-1. Moreover, retroviral mediated overexpression of the murine Cats in primary bone marrow cells lead to decreased colony formation.

The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors that may predispose pediatric cancer patients who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy to CIN and associated sequelae. A total of 113 neutropenia episodes were analyzed and the risk factors for CIN were classified as patient-specific, disease-specific and regimen-specific, while the consequences of CIN were divided into infectious and dose-modifying sequelae. The risks and consequences were analyzed to target high-risk patients with appropriate preventive strategies. Among our patients, 28% presented with a single neutropenia attack, while 72% experienced recurrent attacks during their treatment cycles. The mean absolute neutrophil count was 225.5+/-128.5 x10(9)/l (range, 10-497 x10(9)/l), starting 14.2+/-16.3 days (range, 2-100 days) after the onset of chemotherapy and resolving within 11.2+/-7.3 days, either with (45.1%) or without (54.9%) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). No significant association was observed between any patient characteristics or disease stage and the risk for CIN. However, certain malignancies, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), neuroblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma, and certain regimens, such as induction block for ALL and acute myelocytic leukemia, exerted the most potent myelotoxic effect, with severe and prolonged episodes of neutropenia. G-CSF significantly shortened the duration of the episodes and enhanced bone marrow recovery. Febrile neutropenia was the leading complication among our cases (73.5%) and was associated with several documented infections, particularly mucositis (54.9%), respiratory (45.1%), gastrointestinal tract (38.9%) and skin (23.9%) infections. A total of 6% of our patients succumbed to infection-related complications. Neutropenia was responsible for treatment discontinuation (13.3%), dose delay (13.3%) and dose reduction (5.3%) in our patients.

MDS may rarely be associated with thrombocytosis. In such cases, myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders may overlap, making correct diagnosis difficult. We herein describe a case of MDS with thrombocytosis, Janus kinase 2 gene mutation-positive and Perls' staining-negative, which was initially classified as essential thrombocythemia (ET). This case highlights that MDS may be misdiagnosed as ET and inappropriate treatment may be initiated. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully combine all available data on morphology and immunophenotyping, and to perform the necessary molecular, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analyses, in order to correctly diagnose this disease.","['Ornellas, Maria Helena', 'De Franca Silva, Monique', 'Solza, Cristiana', 'De Lucena Goncalves, Stella Beatriz Sampaio', 'Silva De Almeida, Liliane', 'De Paula Ayres-Silva, Jackline', 'Seixas, Tais Leite', 'Bastos, Elenice Ferreira', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Alves, Gilda']","['Ornellas MH', 'De Franca Silva M', 'Solza C', 'De Lucena Goncalves SB', 'Silva De Almeida L', 'De Paula Ayres-Silva J', 'Seixas TL', 'Bastos EF', 'Liehr T', 'Alves G']","['Department of Pathology, Laboratory of Circulating Markers, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil; Graduation Course in Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Laboratory of Circulating Markers, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil.', 'Department of Haematology, Pedro Ernesto University Hospital (HUPE), Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro 20551-120, Brazil.', 'Department of Haematology, Pedro Ernesto University Hospital (HUPE), Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro 20551-120, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Laboratory of Circulating Markers, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil; Graduation Course in Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro 20551-120, Brazil.', 'Cytogenetics Laboratory, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro 20551-120, Brazil; Department of Medical Genetic, Fernandes Figueira Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro 22250-020, Brazil.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, D-07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Laboratory of Circulating Markers, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil; Graduation Course in Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FCM), Rio de Janeiro 20550-170, Brazil; Research Coordination, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro 20230-130, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160701,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,PMC4997974,,2016/09/03 06:00,2016/09/03 06:01,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2016.947 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-947 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2016 Sep;5(3):227-230. doi: 10.3892/mco.2016.947.

The present study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish candidate genes with an altered methylation status in Chinese leukemia patients. Eligible studies were identified through searching the National Center of Biotechnology Information PubMed and Wanfang databases. Studies were pooled and overall odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 4,325 leukemia patients and 2,010 controls from 94 studies on 53 genes were included in this meta-analysis, and 47 genes were found to be aberrantly methylated in leukemia patients. A further subgroup meta-analysis by leukemia subtype demonstrated that hypermethylation of 5 genes, namely cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKN)2A, DNA-binding protein inhibitor-4, CDKN2B, glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 and p73, contributed to the risk of various subtypes of leukemia. In addition, a strong association between CDKN2A and leukemia was identified in Chinese (P<0.00001) but not in European patients. The aberrantly methylated genes identified in the present meta-analysis may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of leukemia in Chinese patients.","['Jiang, Danjie', 'Li, Yirun', 'Hong, Qingxiao', 'Shen, Yusheng', 'Xu, Chunjing', 'Xu, Yan', 'Zhu, Huangkai', 'Dai, Dongjun', 'Ouyang, Guifang', 'Duan, Shiwei']","['Jiang D', 'Li Y', 'Hong Q', 'Shen Y', 'Xu C', 'Xu Y', 'Zhu H', 'Dai D', 'Ouyang G', 'Duan S']","['Medical Genetics Center, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, P.R.

Our previous study demonstrated that recombinant adenoassociated virus serotype 2 (rAAV-2)-mediated overexpression of Brn3b in RGCs promoted neuroprotection in a rodent model of glaucoma. However, the mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of RGCs in rats overexpressing Brn3b in animal models of glaucoma remain largely unknown. The goal of this study was to understand some of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection of RGCs overexpressing Brn3b during intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in Brown Norway rats. METHODS: One eye of Brown Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) was injected with an AAV construct encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP; recombinant adenoassociated virus-green fluorescent protein, rAAV-hSyn-GFP) or Brn3b (rAAV-hSyn-Brn3b). Expression of antiapoptotic proteins, including B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), and p-AKT, was observed following immunostaining of rat retinas that overexpress Brn3b. In a different set of experiments, intraocular pressure was elevated in one eye of Brown Norway rats, which was followed by intravitreal injection with AAV constructs encoding either GFP (rAAV-CMV-GFP) or Brn3b (rAAV-CMV-Brn3b). Retinal sections were stained for prosurvival factors, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and p-AKT. RESULTS: AAV-mediated expression of transcription factor Brn3b promoted statistically significant upregulation of the Bcl-2 protein and increased expression of p-AKT in RGCs of Brown Norway rats. In addition, following IOP elevation, AAV-mediated Brn3b expression also statistically significantly increased levels of Bcl-2 in the RGC layer in Brown Norway rats. CONCLUSIONS: Adenoassociated virus-mediated Brn3b protein overexpression may promote neuroprotection by upregulating key antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and p-AKT, in animal models of glaucoma.","['Phatak, Nitasha R', 'Stankowska, Dorota L', 'Krishnamoorthy, Raghu R']","['Phatak NR', 'Stankowska DL', 'Krishnamoorthy RR']","['University of North Texas Health Science Center, North Texas Eye Research Institute, Fort Worth, TX.', 'University of North Texas Health Science Center, North Texas Eye Research Institute, Fort Worth, TX.', 'University of North Texas Health Science Center, North Texas Eye Research Institute, Fort Worth, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160816,United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Intraocular Pressure/physiology', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Male', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Ocular Hypertension/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor Brn-3B/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",PMC4990101,,2016/09/03 06:00,2018/01/16 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Mol Vis. 2016 Aug 16;22:1048-61. eCollection 2016.,['R01 EY019952/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor Brn-3B)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes included complete remission, overall survival, and realization of stem cell transplantation after salvage treatment. The overall complete remission rate after first salvage was 40%, ranging from 35%-41% across disease status categories (primary refractory, relapsed with or without prior transplant), and was lower after second (21%) and third or greater (11%) salvage.

METHODS: The clinical features and molecular biological characteristics of 2 patients with CNL complicated with MM were summarized, and the diagnosis and treatment of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The diagnosis of CNL complicated with MM was established in 2 cases. Case 1 had CSF3R mutation (P733T), but CSF3R-exon 14 mutation and SETBP1 mutation were all negative. The neutrophil count returned to normal when MM was successfully treated in case 1. When the patient relapsed, neutrophil count increased again. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of CNL and MM is rare. CSF3R is a very important molecular marker for CNL. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first time to report the coexistence of CNL and MM carried CSF3R mutation (P733T). Chemotherapy regimens for MM may be effective in the treatment of CNL complicated with MM.","['Jiang, B', 'Qi, J Y', 'Li, Q H', 'Xu, Y', 'Sun, M Y', 'Zheng, W W', 'Chen, F', 'Qiu, L G']","['Jiang B', 'Qi JY', 'Li QH', 'Xu Y', 'Sun MY', 'Zheng WW', 'Chen F', 'Qiu LG']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*complications/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7348524,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Aug 14;37(8):688-91. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.011.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 149 newly diagnosed young AML patients (APL excluded) between January 2009 to July 2014 was enrolled. According to the dose of IDA, the patients were divided into three groups, high standard- dose IA group (10- 12 mg . m (- 2) . d(- 1)), low standard-dose IA group (8-9 mg.m(-2).d(-1)) and low-dose IA group (<8 mg.m(-2).d(-1)). The efficacy, adverse effects and long- term prognosis among the three groups were compared. RESULTS: Of them, 34 patients were in high standard-dose IA group, 53 in low standard-dose IA group and 62 in low-dose IA group. After one cycle of induction chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate was 79.4%, 75.5% and 46.8%, the overall response (OR) rate was 97.1%, 94.3% and 64.5%, and the overall CR rate was 85.3%, 81.1% and 54.8%, respectively. Compared with low- dose IA group, high standard- dose IA group and low standard-dose IA group had significantly better result (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the latter two groups (P>0.05). Multivariate analysis also showed that standard-dose IA was favorable factor for induction chemotherapy (P<0.05). The adverse effects were similar in the three group, other than the lowest count of WBC (P=0.002). Low standard-dose IA can improve the OS compared to the low-dose IA (P=0.003), but EFS, RFS was similar in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: For the newly diagnosed young(<55) AML patients, the standard-dose IA has better CR rate. The adverse effects were similar in the three groups. High-dose IA may improve the OS compared to the low-dose IA.","['Zhang, Y', 'Yao, X M', 'Zhu, S L', 'Suo, S S', 'Mao, L P', 'Wei, J Y', 'Yu, W J', 'Mai, W Y', 'Tong, H Y', 'Meng, H T', 'Qian, W B', 'Jin, J']","['Zhang Y', 'Yao XM', 'Zhu SL', 'Suo SS', 'Mao LP', 'Wei JY', 'Yu WJ', 'Mai WY', 'Tong HY', 'Meng HT', 'Qian WB', 'Jin J']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",PMC7348532,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Aug 14;37(8):682-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.010.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mutation analysis of exon 11 and 12 of ASXL2 gene in 59 de novo AML patients was performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The clinical features, survival curve and c-kit gene mutation in ASXL2 gene mutation positive and negative patients were compared. RESULTS: In a total of 59 AML patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene positive, 11.9% (7/59) patients harboured ASXL2 gene mutations. The hemoglobin levels of patients with mutated ASXL2 gene [56.2 (38.0- 72.0) g/L] were significantly lower than those with wild type ASXL2 [69.0(37.2-154.0) g/L] (P=0.038). Differences were not observed in white blood cell counts, platelet counts, the proportion of acidophilic cell, and the proportion of primitive cell in the marrow between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). None of all 59 patients suffered from liver, spleen, central nervous system metastases in both groups. Moreover, enlarged lymph nodes was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.859). Immunophenotypic analysis: in positive group CD33 positive expression was significantly lower than that of negative group (P=0.033). cCD3 was not expressed in both groups. Expression levels of CD117, cMPO, HLA-DR, CD34, CD38, CD13, CD44, CD15, CD64, CD11b, CD56, CD19, cCD79a and CD7 were similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). All of 59 patients were in remission (P=0.577). Overall survival was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.631). The mutation rates of c- kit in positive group and negative group were 14.3% and 29.4%, without statistical significance (P= 0.697). CONCLUSIONS: ASXL2 mutation may be a new event that can cooperate with AML1-ETO to induce leukemia. Patients in AML1- ETO positive AML with ASXL2 mutation show specific clinical characteristics of hemoglobin levels and expression level of CD33. ASXL2 gene mutations and c-kit gene mutations may not have a specific correlation between them.","['Zhao, J X', 'Chen, X H', 'Li, J L', 'Pan, J', 'Tan, Y H', 'Xu, Z F', 'Ren, F G', 'Zhang, Y F', 'Xu, J', 'Li, M Q', 'Li, J', 'Zhang, N', 'Chang, J M', 'Wang, X J', 'Wang, H W']","['Zhao JX', 'Chen XH', 'Li JL', 'Pan J', 'Tan YH', 'Xu ZF', 'Ren FG', 'Zhang YF', 'Xu J', 'Li MQ', 'Li J', 'Zhang N', 'Chang JM', 'Wang XJ', 'Wang HW']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",PMC7348531,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Aug 14;37(8):676-81. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.08.009.,,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (ASXL2 protein, human)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Of them, 4 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 1 had follicular lymphoma, 5 had B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, 9 had T- lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, 1 patient anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative), 5 had peripheral T-cell lymphoma (NOS), and 1 had NK/T-cell lymphoma. At the time of initial diagnosis, 6 patients had Ann Arbor stage disease, 20 patients showed stage . At the time of Haplo- HSCT, 7 patients were in the first complete remission (CR1), 4 in the second complete remission (CR2), 7 in partial remission, 1 in stable disease, 7 in progressive disease, and 19 of 26 patients were refractory or relapsed. The neutrophil and platelet counts recovered at 12 (11-17) d and 14 (11-31) d after Haplo- HSCT, respectively. All patients achieved full donor chimerism at 30d after Haplo- HSCT. With a median follow- up of 14 (4- 136) months, 20 cases (76.92%) survived, 15 (57.69%) survived without lymphoma, and 7 (26.92%) relapsed. Conditioning regimen related adverse reactions were all disappeared after treatment. The estimated 2-year recurrence rate after Haplo-HSCT was 42.20%. The estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 71.60% and 48.90%, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential of venetoclax to prolong the corrected QT (QTc) interval and to evaluate the relationship between systemic venetoclax concentration and QTc interval. METHODS: The study population included 176 male and female patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 105) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 71) enrolled in a phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy study. Electrocardiograms were collected in triplicate at time-matched points (2, 4, 6, and 8 h) prior to the first venetoclax administration and after repeated venetoclax administration to achieve steady state conditions. Venetoclax doses ranged from 100 to 1200 mg daily. Plasma venetoclax samples were collected after steady state electrocardiogram measurements. RESULTS: The mean and upper bound of the 2-sided 90 % confidence interval (CI) QTc change from baseline were <5 and <10 ms, respectively, at all time points and doses (<400, 400, and >400 mg). Three subjects had single QTc values >500 ms and/or DeltaQTc > 60 ms. The effect of venetoclax concentration on both DeltaQTc and QTc was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). At the mean maximum concentrations achieved with therapeutic (400 mg) and supra-therapeutic (1200 mg) venetoclax doses, the estimated drug effects on QTc were 0.137 (90 % CI [-1.01 to 1.28]) and 0.263 (90 % CI [-1.92 to 2.45]) ms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Venetoclax does not prolong QTc interval even at supra-therapeutic doses, and there is no relationship between venetoclax concentrations and QTc interval.","['Freise, Kevin J', 'Dunbar, Martin', 'Jones, Aksana K', 'Hoffman, David', 'Enschede, Sari L Heitner', 'Wong, Shekman', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Freise KJ', 'Dunbar M', 'Jones AK', 'Hoffman D', 'Enschede SL', 'Wong S', 'Salem AH']","['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Medical Affairs, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, 60064, IL, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie, 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.', 'Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. ahmed.salem@abbvie.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160901,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrocardiography/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Long QT Syndrome/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00280-016-3144-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-016-3144-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2016 Oct;78(4):847-53. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3144-1.

Multiple studies suggest that the structure of the variable domains of the surface IGs on these cells, and signaling through them, play key roles in developing the disease. Hence, CLL appears to be driven by antigen-BCR interactions, and identifying the selecting antigens involved in this process is an important goal. We studied the antigen-binding characteristics of 23 CLL-derived, recombinantly-expressed IGs with 5 pathogenic bacteria, determining that CLL IGs differ in bacterial reactivity based on IGHV gene use, mutation status, and association with IGHD and IGHJ genes (""stereotypy""). Although most bacterial-reactive IGs followed the paradigm that IGHV-unmutated IGs were more auto-/poly-reactive, several did not. In addition, some CLL IGs were bacterial mono-reactive, and these displayed IGKV use biases. These findings are consistent with CLL B cells being driven into the leukemogenic process by bacterial as well as auto- antigens.","['Hatzi, Katerina', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Moreno Atanasio, Carolina', 'Fischetti, Vincent A', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Hatzi K', 'Catera R', 'Moreno Atanasio C', 'Fischetti VA', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chu CC', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.

Hence a better understanding of the CML LSCs is necessary to eradicate these cells and achieve complete cure. Using the miRNA-gene interaction networks from the CML lin(-) cells we identified a set of up/down-regulated miRNAs and corresponding target genes. Association studies (Pearson correlation) from the miRNA and gene expression data showed that miR-1469 and miR-1972 have significantly higher number of target genes, 75 and 50 respectively. We observed that miR-1972 induces G2-M cell cycle arrest and miR-1469 moderately arrested G1 cell cycle when overexpressed in KCL22 cells. We have earlier shown that a combination of imatinib and JAK inhibitor I can significantly bring down the proliferation of CML lineage negative cells. Here we observed that imatinib and JAK inhibitor I combination restored the expression pattern of the down-regulated miRNAs in primary CML lin(-) cells. Thus effective manipulation of the deregulated miRNAs can restore the miRNA-mRNA networks that can efficiently inhibit CML stem and progenitor cells and alleviate the disease.","['Agatheeswaran, S', 'Pattnayak, N C', 'Chakraborty, S']","['Agatheeswaran S', 'Pattnayak NC', 'Chakraborty S']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160902,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/*genetics', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",PMC5009428,,2016/09/03 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['srep32493 [pii]', '10.1038/srep32493 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 2;6:32493. doi: 10.1038/srep32493.,,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we studied plant allergenic profilins rHev b 8 (rubber tree) and rZea m 12 (maize) because they represent an important example of cross-reactivity in the latex-pollen-food syndrome. Both allergens in their monomeric and dimeric states were isolated and characterized by exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry and were used in immunological in vitro experiments. Their crystal structures were solved, and for Hev b 8 a disulfide-linked homodimer was found. Comparing the structures we established that the longest loop is relevant for recognition by IgE antibodies, whereas the conserved regions are important for cross-reactivity. We produced a novel monoclonal murine IgE (mAb 2F5), specific for rHev b 8, which was useful to provide evidence that profilin dimerization considerably increases the IgE-mediated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia cells.","['Mares-Mejia, Israel', 'Martinez-Caballero, Siseth', 'Garay-Canales, Claudia', 'Cano-Sanchez, Patricia', 'Torres-Larios, Alfredo', 'Lara-Gonzalez, Samuel', 'Ortega, Enrique', 'Rodriguez-Romero, Adela']","['Mares-Mejia I', 'Martinez-Caballero S', 'Garay-Canales C', 'Cano-Sanchez P', 'Torres-Larios A', 'Lara-Gonzalez S', 'Ortega E', 'Rodriguez-Romero A']","['Instituto de Quimica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Circuito Exterior, Cd.

Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays a pivotal role in meeting the anabolic demands for cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which PPP contributes to leukaemia remains elusive. Here, we report that leukaemia cell proliferation is dependent on the oxidative branch of PPP, in particular the first and rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Knockdown of G6PD reduces NADPH level in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines. Exogenous lipid supplements partially restore the proliferation of G6PD-depleted cells. Deacetylase SIRT2 promotes NADPH production through deacetylating G6PD at lysine 403 (K403). Activation of G6PD by SIRT2 supports the proliferation and clonogenic activity of leukaemia cells. Chemical inhibitors against SIRT2 suppress G6PD activity, leading to reduced cell proliferation of leukaemia cells, but not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Importantly, SIRT2 is overexpressed in clinical AML samples, while K403 acetylation is downregulated and G6PD catalytic activity is increased comparing to that of normal control. Together, our study reveals that acetylation regulation of G6PD is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of AML, and SIRT2 serves as a promising target for further therapeutic investigations.","['Xu, Shuang-Nian', 'Wang, Tian-Shi', 'Li, Xi', 'Wang, Yi-Ping']","['Xu SN', 'Wang TS', 'Li X', 'Wang YP']","['Department of Haematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory for Tumour Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 280 Chongqing South Rd., Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory for Tumour Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 280 Chongqing South Rd., Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160902,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'NADP/*analysis', 'Sirtuin 2/*metabolism']",PMC5009355,,2016/09/03 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep32734 [pii]', '10.1038/srep32734 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 2;6:32734. doi: 10.1038/srep32734.,,"['53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of novel genetic and epigenetic markers has helped to close this gap and increased the specificity of risk stratification, although most studies have been conducted in specific AML subpopulations. In order to overcome this limitation, we used a genome-wide approach in multiple AML populations to develop a robust prediction model for AML survival. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide expression analysis of two data sets from AML patients enrolled into the AMLCG-1999 trial and from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to develop a prognostic score to refine current risk classification and performed a validation on two data sets of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and an independent AMLCG cohort. RESULTS: In our training set, using a stringent multi-step approach, we identified a small three-gene prognostic scoring system, named Tri-AML score (TriAS) which highly correlated with overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed TriAS to be an independent prognostic factor in all tested training and additional validation sets, even including age, current cytogenetic-based risk stratification, and three other recently developed expression-based scoring models for AML. CONCLUSIONS: The Tri-AML score allows robust and clinically practical risk stratification for the outcome of AML patients. TriAS substantially refined current ELN risk stratification assigning 44.5 % of the patients into a different risk category.","['Wilop, Stefan', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Crysandt, Martina', 'Panse, Jens', 'Chuang, Ming-Kai', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Wagner, Wolfgang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Kharabi Masouleh, Behzad']","['Wilop S', 'Chou WC', 'Jost E', 'Crysandt M', 'Panse J', 'Chuang MK', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Wagner W', 'Tien HF', 'Kharabi Masouleh B']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular, Engineering, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering - Cell Biology, University Hospital of the RWTH, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. bkharabi@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160901,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Supervised Machine Learning', 'Survival Rate']",PMC5009640,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0308-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0308-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep 1;9(1):78. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0308-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The giant cells could be neoplastic and nonneoplastic. The nonneoplastic giant cells are of different histogenesis. They include, in the majority of cases, histiocytes. Usually, they are minor easily recognizable components of the nodal lymphomas. To our knowledge, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas with numerous multinucleated histiocytic giant cells without epithelioid granulomas or crystals formation have not been previously reported. This might present a diagnostic challenge for the unwary pathologists since the diagnostic workout will be focused on the giant cells that might mask the apparently mixed bland-looking neoplastic lymphocytic background. We report a case of a 24-year-old woman who presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and B-symptoms. The lymph nodes were enlarged and diffusely effaced with a striking feature of numerous multinucleated giant cells with a background of apparently mixed population of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. Initially, the diagnosis of a small low-grade lymphoma was histologically missed and the focus was on the differential diagnoses of the giant cells. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry raised the suspicion of masked small lymphocytic lymphoma that was subsequently confirmed by molecular studies. The rarity of small lymphocytic lymphoma and the unusual histologic features in this case confounded the clinical and pathologic diagnosis.","['AbdullGaffar, Badr', 'Seliem, Rania M', 'Al Thahyabat, Mahammad', 'Odeh, Bassam', 'Al Olama, Asma']","['AbdullGaffar B', 'Seliem RM', 'Al Thahyabat M', 'Odeh B', 'Al Olama A']","['1 Rashid Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', '1 Rashid Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', '1 Rashid Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', '1 Rashid Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', '2 Dubai Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160924,United States,Int J Surg Pathol,International journal of surgical pathology,9314927,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Giant Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['1066896916666675 [pii]', '10.1177/1066896916666675 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Surg Pathol. 2017 Apr;25(2):185-190. doi: 10.1177/1066896916666675.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is intensively studied over long periods of time. Till nowaday, most of the studies primarily focus on the leukemic cells rather than how normal hematopoietic cells are affected by the leukemic environment. Accordingly, the conventional animal models for AML are mostly myeloablated as leukemia can be induced with short latency and complete penetrance. Meanwhile, most previous computational models focus on modeling the leukemic cells but not the multi-tissue leukemic body resided by both leukemic and normal blood cells. Recently, a non-irradiated AML mouse model has been established; therefore, normal hematopoietic cells can be investigated during leukemia development. Experiments based on the non-irradiated animal model have monitored the kinetics of leukemic and (intact) hematopoietic cells in multiple tissues simultaneously; and thus a systematic computational model for the multi-tissue hematopoiesis under leukemia has become possible. RESULTS: In the present work, we adopted the modeling methods in previous works, but aimed to model the tri-tissue (peripheral blood, spleen and bone marrow) dynamics of hematopoiesis under leukemia. The cell kinetics generated from the non-irradiated experimental model were used as the reference data for modeling. All mathematical formulas were systematically enumerated, and model parameters were estimated via numerical optimization. Multiple validations by additional experimental data were then conducted for the established computational model. In the results, we illustrated that the important fact of functional depression of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/HPC) in leukemic bone marrow (BM), which must require additional experiments to be established, could also be inferred from our computation model that utilized only the cell kinetics data as the input. CONCLUSION: The digitalized AML model established in the present work is effective for reconstructing the hematopoiesis under leukemia as well as simulating the hematopoietic response to leukemic cell expansion. Given the validity and efficiency, the model can be of potential utilities in future biomedical studies; additionally, the modeling method itself can be also applied elsewhere.","['Li, Rudong', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Liu, Lei']","['Li R', 'Cheng H', 'Cheng T', 'Liu L']","['Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformatics Technology, Shanghai, 201203, China. liulei@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Institutes for Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200031, China. liulei@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160826,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spleen/pathology/physiopathology']",PMC5009825,,2016/09/03 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2016/09/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-016-0308-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-016-0308-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2016 Aug 26;10 Suppl 3:64. doi: 10.1186/s12918-016-0308-x.,['R21 AA020104/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Computational modeling leukemia', '*Hematopoietic suppression', '*Increased quiescence of HSC', '*Non-irradiated AML model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of these findings is also discussed, along with their clinical significance, association with hematologic markers and the ophthalmologist's role caring for these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have included a large case series examining the prevalence of ocular manifestations in newly diagnosed leukemic patients as well as case reports of ocular manifestations of leukemia. SUMMARY: Patients with leukemia often have ocular manifestations. These occur either from direct infiltration of neoplastic cells or from indirect or secondary causes, including hematologic abnormalities, central nervous system involvement, opportunistic infections, or from treatment. Although nearly all ocular structures can be affected, leukemic retinopathy is often the most clinically apparent manifestation. Awareness of the ophthalmic manifestations of leukemia is important as they may precede systemic diagnosis or may be a sign of leukemia recurrence.","['Talcott, Katherine E', 'Garg, Ravin J', 'Garg, Sunir J']","['Talcott KE', 'Garg RJ', 'Garg SJ']","['aMid Atlantic Retina, the Retina Service of Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania bJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland cAnne Arundel Medical Center, Annapolis, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Current opinion in ophthalmology,9011108,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Eye/pathology', 'Eye Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/therapy', '*Ophthalmology', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications', ""*Physician's Role"", 'Prevalence', 'Retinal Diseases/etiology']",,,2016/10/18 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/ICU.0000000000000309 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2016 Nov;27(6):545-551. doi: 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000309.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate how pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins impact on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we generated mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9 and MLL-ENL AMLs from BH3-only gene knockout mice. Disease development was not accelerated by loss of Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bmf, or combinations thereof; hence these BH3-only proteins are apparently ineffectual as tumor suppressors in this model. We tested the sensitivity of MLL-AF9 AMLs of each genotype in vitro to standard chemotherapeutic drugs and to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, with or without the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Loss of Puma and/or Noxa increased resistance to cytarabine, daunorubicin and etoposide, while loss of Bim protected against cytarabine and loss of Bmf had no impact. ABT-737 increased sensitivity to the genotoxic drugs but was not dependent on any BH3-only protein tested. The AML lines were very sensitive to bortezomib and loss of Noxa conveyed significant resistance. In vivo, several MLL-AF9 AMLs responded well to daunorubicin and this response was highly dependent on Puma and Noxa but not Bim. Combination therapy with ABT-737 provided little added benefit at the daunorubicin dose trialed. Bortezomib also extended survival of AML-bearing mice, albeit less than daunorubicin. In summary, our genetic studies reveal the importance of Puma and Noxa for the action of genotoxics currently used to treat MLL-driven AML and suggest that, while addition of ABT-737-like BH3 mimetics might enhance their efficacy, new Noxa-like BH3 mimetics targeting Mcl-1 might have greater potential.","['Bilardi, Rebecca A', 'Anstee, Natasha S', 'Glaser, Stefan P', 'Robati, Mikara', 'Vandenberg, Cassandra J', 'Cory, Suzanne']","['Bilardi RA', 'Anstee NS', 'Glaser SP', 'Robati M', 'Vandenberg CJ', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160901,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/genetics/*pathology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC5059861,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016258 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.258 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Sep 1;7(9):e2351. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.258.,,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Totally 50 CLL patients and 20 Health controls were included in this study. Regulatory T (Treg) cells and the cell subset secreting IL-17 (Th17) in peripheral blood were detected with flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17 were determined with ELISA, and expression of Foxp3 and RORgammat was assessed with quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Treg and Th17 cell proportions in peripheral blood in the CLL patients were significantly higher than control. Serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17, and expression of Foxp3 and RORgammat, were significantly increased in the CLL patients. Ratios of Treg/Th17 and IL-10/IL-17 were significantly elevated in the CLL patients. Compared with those before treatment, Treg/Th17 and IL-10/IL-17 ratios were declined in the CLL patients in remission. Compared with the non-remission group, Treg cells were significantly decreased, while Th17 cells were significantly increased, resulting in decreased Treg/Th17 ratio, in the remission group. Moreover, the serum IL-10 level was significantly decreased, while the serum IL-17 level was significantly increased, resulting in declined IL-10/IL-17 ratio, in the remission group. Correlation analysis showed that, Treg and Th17 cell counts were significantly associated with CD38 and ZAP-70 expression in the CLL patients. Moreover, the IL-10/IL-17 ratio was also significantly associated with CLL prognostic factors.

Prior work established doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) as a conserved transcriptional regulator of male sexual differentiation. Here we investigate the role of Dmrt1 in mouse spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homeostasis. We find that Dmrt1 maintains SSCs during steady state spermatogenesis, where it regulates expression of Plzf, another transcription factor required for SSC maintenance. We also find that Dmrt1 is required for recovery of spermatogenesis after germ cell depletion. Committed progenitor cells expressing Ngn3 normally do not contribute to SSCs marked by the Id4-Gfp transgene, but do so when spermatogonia are chemically depleted using busulfan. Removal of Dmrt1 from Ngn3-positive germ cells blocks the replenishment of Id4-GFP-positive SSCs and recovery of spermatogenesis after busulfan treatment. Our data therefore reveal that Dmrt1 supports SSC maintenance in two ways: allowing SSCs to remain in the stem cell pool under normal conditions; and enabling progenitor cells to help restore the stem cell pool after germ cell depletion.","['Zhang, Teng', 'Oatley, Jon', 'Bardwell, Vivian J', 'Zarkower, David']","['Zhang T', 'Oatley J', 'Bardwell VJ', 'Zarkower D']","['Developmental Biology Center and Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, Center for Reproductive Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, United States of America.', 'Developmental Biology Center and Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Developmental Biology Center and Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160901,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Spermatogenesis/*genetics', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5008761,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/09/02 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1006293 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-16-00917 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2016 Sep 1;12(9):e1006293. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006293. eCollection 2016 Sep.,"['F32 GM106484/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM059152/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD061665/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DMRT1 protein)', '0 (Idb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurog3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,['Biol Reprod. 2016 Nov;95(5):111.

Then, several stop studies of first-generation (imatinib) and second-generation ABL TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib), which induce earlier response than imatinib, have also been started. These studies revealed that almost half of CML patients who are treated with ABL TKIs and achieve a certain period of sustained deep molecular response can stop ABL TKIs safely and obtain treatment free remission (TFR). AEs of ABL TKIs withdrawal and predicting factors for successful discontinuation including immunity are becoming clear gradually through these studies.

Some of these studies have led to the identification of some progenitor cells that sustain angiogenesis through indirect, paracrine mechanisms (hematopoietic angiogenic cells) and through direct mechanisms, i.e., through their capacity to generate a progeny of phenotypically and functionally competent endothelial cells [endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs)]. The contribution of these progenitors to angiogenetic processes under physiological and pathological conditions is intensively investigated. Angiogenetic mechanisms are stimulated in various hematological malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, resulting in an increased angiogenesis that contributes to disease progression. In some of these conditions there is preliminary evidence that some endothelial cells could derive from the malignant clone, thus leading to the speculation that the leukemic cell derives from the malignant transformation of a hemangioblastic progenitor, i.e., of a cell capable of differentiation to the hematopoietic and to the endothelial cell lineages. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying increased angiogenesis in these malignancies not only contributed to a better knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for tumor progression, but also offered the way for the discovery of new therapeutic targets.","['Testa, Ugo', 'Saulle, Ernestina', 'Castelli, Germana', 'Pelosi, Elvira']","['Testa U', 'Saulle E', 'Castelli G', 'Pelosi E']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160701,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,PMC4981702,,2016/09/02 06:00,2016/09/02 06:01,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2016.06.07 [doi]', 'sci-03-2016.06.07 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2016 Jul 1;3:26. doi: 10.21037/sci.2016.06.07. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'endothelial colony-forming cell (ECFS)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we review mutation-associated mechanisms that inactivate PTEN together with other molecular mechanisms that activate AKT and contribute to T-cell leukemogenesis. In addition, we discuss how Pten mutations in mouse models affect the efficacy of gamma-secretase inhibitors to block NOTCH1 signaling through activation of AKT. Based on these models and on observations in primary diagnostic samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we speculate that PTEN-deficient cells employ an intrinsic homeostatic mechanism in which PI3K-AKT signaling is dampened over time. As a result of this reduced PI3K-AKT signaling, the level of AKT activation may be insufficient to compensate for NOTCH1 inhibition, resulting in responsiveness to gamma-secretase inhibitors. On the other hand, de novo acquired PTEN-inactivating events in NOTCH1-dependent leukemia could result in temporary, strong activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and consequently gamma-secretase inhibitor resistance. Due to the central role of PTEN-AKT signaling and in the resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition, AKT inhibitors may be a promising addition to current treatment protocols for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Mendes, Rui D', 'Cante-Barrett, Kirsten', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Meijerink, Jules P P']","['Mendes RD', 'Cante-Barrett K', 'Pieters R', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands j.meijerink@erasmusmc.nl.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5060017,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2016.146381 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.146381 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Sep;101(9):1010-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.146381.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst a few genes have been implied to have diagnostic, prognostic and even predictive impact, most gene mutations still require rigorous validation in larger, preferably prospective patient series, to scrutinize their potential role in lymphoma diagnostics and patient management. In selected entities, a predominantly mutated gene is identified in almost all cases (e.g. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and hairy-cell leukemia), while for the vast majority of lymphomas a quite diverse mutation pattern is observed, with a limited number of frequently mutated genes followed by a seemingly endless tail of genes with mutations at a low frequency. Herein, the European Expert Group on NGS-based Diagnostics in Lymphomas (EGNL) summarizes the current status of this ever-evolving field, and, based on the present evidence level, segregates mutations into the following categories: i) immediate impact on treatment decisions, ii) diagnostic impact, iii) prognostic impact, iv) potential clinical impact in the near future, or v) should only be considered for research purposes.

In this study, we examined whether eupafolin could sensitize TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. We found that eupafolin alone and TRAIL alone had no effect on apoptosis. However, combined treatment with eupafolin and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in human renal carcinoma (Caki) cells, glioma cells (U251MG), and prostate cancer cells (DU145), but not normal cells [mesangial cells (MC) and normal mouse kidney cells (TCMK-1)]. Eupafolin induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels in cathepsin S-dependent manner, and over-expression of Mcl-1 markedly blocked apoptosis induced by combined treatment with eupafolin and TRAIL. In addition, eupafolin increased Bim expression at the post-translational levels via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated inhibition of proteasome activity. Knock-down of Bim expression by siRNA inhibited eupafolin plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, combined treatment with eupafolin and TRAIL reduced tumor growth in xenograft models. Taken together, these results suggest that eupafolin enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via down-regulation of Mcl-1 and up-regulation of Bim in renal carcinoma Caki cells.","['Han, Min Ae', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Woo, Seon Min', 'Seo, Bo Ram', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Han MA', 'Min KJ', 'Woo SM', 'Seo BR', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cathepsins/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5323186,,2016/09/02 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['11604 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11604 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 4;7(40):65707-65720. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11604.,,"['0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.27 (cathepsin S)', 'I3O7LF3GED (eupafolin)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AMPK', 'Mcl-1', 'TRAIL', 'cathepsin S', 'eupafolin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) occur in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients, causing metabolic and epigenetic derangements. We have now discovered that altered metabolism in leukemic cells has a profound effect on cardiac metabolism. Combining mathematical modeling and in vivo as well as ex vivo studies, we found that increased amounts of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2-HG), produced by IDH2 mutant leukemic cells, cause contractile dysfunction in the heart. This contractile dysfunction is associated with impaired oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate, a redirection of Krebs cycle intermediates, and increased ATP citrate lyase (ACL) activity. Increased availability of D2-HG also leads to altered histone methylation and acetylation in the heart. We propose that D2-HG promotes cardiac dysfunction by impairing alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and induces histone modifications in an ACL-dependent manner. Collectively, our results highlight the impact of cancer cell metabolism on function and metabolism of the heart.","['Karlstaedt, Anja', 'Zhang, Xiaotian', 'Vitrac, Heidi', 'Harmancey, Romain', 'Vasquez, Hernan', 'Wang, Jing Han', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Taegtmeyer, Heinrich']","['Karlstaedt A', 'Zhang X', 'Vitrac H', 'Harmancey R', 'Vasquez H', 'Wang JH', 'Goodell MA', 'Taegtmeyer H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216; Mississippi Center for Obesity Research, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216; Cardiovascular-Renal Research Center, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030; Heinrich.Taegtmeyer@uth.tmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160831,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['ATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cardiomyopathies/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Glutarates/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myocardium/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC5027422,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2016/09/02 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1601650113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1601650113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 13;113(37):10436-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1601650113.

Although the addition of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to standard cytotoxic therapy has greatly improved upfront treatment, treatment-related morbidity and mortality remain high. TKI monotherapy provides only temporary responses and renders patients susceptible to the development of TKI resistance. Thus, identifying agents that could enhance the activity of TKIs is urgently needed. Recently, a selective inhibitor of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), ABT-199 (venetoclax), has shown impressive activity against hematologic malignancies. We demonstrate that the combination of TKIs with venetoclax is highly synergistic in vitro, decreasing cell viability and inducing apoptosis in Ph(+)ALL. Furthermore, the multikinase inhibitors dasatinib and ponatinib appear to have the added advantage of inducing Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase (LYN)-mediated proapoptotic BCL-2-like protein 11 (BIM) expression and inhibiting up-regulation of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), thereby potentially overcoming the development of venetoclax resistance. Evaluation of the dasatinib-venetoclax combination for the treatment of primary Ph(+)ALL patient samples in xenografted immunodeficient mice confirmed the tolerability of this drug combination and demonstrated its superior antileukemic efficacy compared to either agent alone. These data suggest that the combination of dasatinib and venetoclax has the potential to improve the treatment of Ph(+)ALL and should be further evaluated for patient care.","['Leonard, Jessica T', 'Rowley, Joelle S J', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Traer, Elie', 'Hayes-Lattin, Brandon', 'Loriaux, Marc', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Chang, Bill H']","['Leonard JT', 'Rowley JS', 'Eide CA', 'Traer E', 'Hayes-Lattin B', 'Loriaux M', 'Spurgeon SE', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW', 'Chang BH']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.

Some studies have suggested that early antifungal therapy is associated with decreased mortality; however, it is difficult to promptly diagnose candidemia because of the poor sensitivity of blood cultures. Thus, prophylaxis against Candida infection is recommended in patient groups in whom the risk of infection is high, such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients or those undergoing intensive remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Non-Candida albicans candidemia is dominant among hematology patients, and the use of an echinocandin is recommended as the initial therapy. However, echinocandin-resistant Candida have been reported with increasing frequency, mainly in Candida glabrata. Several studies have reported that echinocandin resistance is associated with prior exposure to an echinocandin. Therefore, susceptibility testing is vital in treating severe or refractory candidemia, and the introduction of an antifungal stewardship program is recommended.","['Okinaka, Keiji']",['Okinaka K'],"['Division of General Internal Medicine, National Cancer Center Hospital East / Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Med Mycol J,Medical mycology journal,101562838,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Candida/drug effects/isolation & purification', '*Candidemia/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', '*Cross Infection/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Echinocandins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gentian Violet', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3314/mmj.16.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Mycol J. 2016;57(3):J117-23. doi: 10.3314/mmj.16.003.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', 'J4Z741D6O5 (Gentian Violet)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are characterized by increased oxidative phosphorylation and robust ATP production. We demonstrate that ORP4L is expressed in T-ALL but not normal T-cells and its abundance is proportional to cellular ATP. ORP4L acts as an adaptor/scaffold assembling CD3varepsilon, Galphaq/11 and PLCbeta3 into a complex that activates PLCbeta3. PLCbeta3 catalyzes IP3 production in T-ALL as opposed to PLCgamma1 in normal T-cells. Up-regulation of ORP4L thus results in a switch in the enzyme responsible for IP3-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and oxidative phosphorylation. ORP4L knockdown results in suboptimal bioenergetics, cell death and abrogation of T-ALL engraftment in vivo. In summary, we uncovered a signalling pathway operating specifically in T-ALL cells in which ORP4L mediates G protein-coupled ligand-induced PLCbeta3 activation, resulting in an increase of mitochondrial respiration for cell survival. Targeting ORP4L might represent a promising approach for T-ALL treatment.","['Zhong, Wenbin', 'Yi, Qing', 'Xu, Bing', 'Li, Shiqian', 'Wang, Tong', 'Liu, Fupei', 'Zhu, Biying', 'Hoffmann, Peter R', 'Ji, Guangju', 'Lei, Pingsheng', 'Li, Guoping', 'Li, Jiwei', 'Li, Jian', 'Olkkonen, Vesa M', 'Yan, Daoguang']","['Zhong W', 'Yi Q', 'Xu B', 'Li S', 'Wang T', 'Liu F', 'Zhu B', 'Hoffmann PR', 'Ji G', 'Lei P', 'Li G', 'Li J', 'Li J', 'Olkkonen VM', 'Yan D']","['Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, John A.

A variety of approaches have been employed for implementation of this technique, including pooled, depletion/enrichment screening with lentiviral shRNAs, and segregated screening of panels of individual siRNAs. The latter approach of siRNA panel screening requires efficient methods for transfection of siRNAs into the target cells. In the case of suspension leukemia cell lines and primary cells, many of the conventional transfection techniques using liposomal or calcium phosphate-mediated transfection provide very low efficiency. In this case, electroporation is the only transfection technique offering high efficiency transfection of siRNAs into the target leukemia cells. Here, we describe methods for optimization and implementation of siRNA electroporation into leukemia cell lines and primary patient specimens, and we further offer suggested electroporation settings for some commonly used leukemia cell lines.","['Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W']","['Agarwal A', 'Tyner JW']","['Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Department of Molecular & Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. agarwala@ohsu.edu.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. agarwala@ohsu.edu.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Electroporation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', '*RNA Interference']",PMC5240908,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-6337-9_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1470:85-94. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6337-9_7.,['R00 CA151670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS822045'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Electroporation', '*Leukemia', '*siRNA screening']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which ethanol (EtOH) exerts its carcinogenic effect on the colorectal mucosa are not clear and may include oxidative stress with the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated through EtOH metabolism via cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) leading to carcinogenic etheno-DNA adducts. ROS may also induce apoptosis. However, the effect of chronic EtOH consumption on CYP2E1, etheno-DNA adducts as well as anti-apoptotic proteins in the colorectal mucosa of heavy drinkers without colorectal inflammation is still not known. METHODS: Rectal biopsies from 32 alcoholics (>60 g EtOH/d) and from 12 controls (<20 g EtOH/d) were histologically examined, and immunohistochemistry for CYP2E1 and etheno-DNA adducts was performed. Apoptosis (cleaved PARP) as well as anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-xL , Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 were immunohistochemically determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in mucosal CYP2E1 or etheno-DNA adducts was observed between alcoholics and control patients. However, CYP2E1 and etheno-DNA adducts correlated significantly when both groups were combined (p < 0.001). In addition, although apoptosis was found not to be significantly affected by EtOH, the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, but neither Bcl-xL nor Bcl-2, was found to be significantly increased in heavy drinkers as compared to controls (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Although colorectal CYP2E1 was not found to be significantly increased in alcoholics, CYP2E1 correlated overall with the level of etheno-DNA adducts in the colorectal mucosa, which identifies CYP2E1 as an important factor in colorectal carcinogenesis. Most importantly, however, is the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in heavy drinkers counteracting apoptosis and possibly stimulating cancer development.","['Koehler, Bruno Christian', 'Arslic-Schmitt, Tatjana', 'Peccerella, Theresa', 'Scherr, Anna-Lena', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Bruckner, Thomas', 'Gdynia, Georg', 'Jager, Dirk', 'Mueller, Sebastian', 'Bartsch, Helmut', 'Seitz, Helmut K']","['Koehler BC', 'Arslic-Schmitt T', 'Peccerella T', 'Scherr AL', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Bruckner T', 'Gdynia G', 'Jager D', 'Mueller S', 'Bartsch H', 'Seitz HK']","['National Tumor Centre, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre of Alcohol Research (CAR), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Salem Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre of Alcohol Research (CAR), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Tumor Centre, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Tumor Centre, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Tumor Centre, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre of Alcohol Research (CAR), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Salem Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Erstwhile: Division of Toxicology and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre of Alcohol Research (CAR), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. helmut_karl.seitz@urz.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Department of Medicine, Salem Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Germany. helmut_karl.seitz@urz.uni-heidelberg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160901,England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,IM,"['Aged', 'Alcoholism/complications/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*chemically induced', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Rectum/drug effects/*metabolism']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/acer.13180 [doi]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2016 Oct;40(10):2094-2101. doi: 10.1111/acer.13180.

The patient had unfavorable anatomy for endovascular aneurysm repair, and therefore, an open procedure was planned. To reduce risk for perioperative bleeding and optimize patient preoperative status, a staged approach was employed. Initially, several sessions of embolization of 2 splenic artery branches were performed with the intent to decrease spleen size and to increase platelet count thus decreasing the perioperative bleeding risk. Then, after successfully increasing platelet count (280 000 PLT/muL), open repair of the aneurysm was conducted. This case demonstrates that selective splenic embolization in patients with hypersplenism and subsequent thrombocytopenia who are in need for major surgery may achieve a significant rise in platelet count and optimize patient's preoperative status in order to avoid bleeding complications.","['Maras, Dimitrios', 'Kontopodis, Nikolaos', 'Dedes, Athansios', 'Tsanis, Antonios', 'Mazarakis, Ioannis', 'Gekas, Christos', 'Ioannou, Christos V']","['Maras D', 'Kontopodis N', 'Dedes A', 'Tsanis A', 'Mazarakis I', 'Gekas C', 'Ioannou CV']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Vascular Surgery Unit, University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Radiology, Interventional Radiology Unit, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece ioannou@med.uoc.gr.', 'Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Vascular Surgery Unit, University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece ioannou@med.uoc.gr.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160831,United States,Vasc Endovascular Surg,Vascular and endovascular surgery,101136421,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/complications/diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Aortography/methods', 'Blood Loss, Surgical/prevention & control', '*Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects', 'Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Splenic Artery/diagnostic imaging', 'Splenomegaly/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*complications/diagnosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1538574416666222 [pii]', '10.1177/1538574416666222 [doi]']",ppublish,Vasc Endovascular Surg. 2016 Aug;50(6):438-42. doi: 10.1177/1538574416666222.

The run time of this protocol may vary depending on the volume of miRNA sequencing data and available computing resources but takes ~5 h of computing time for typical experiments and less than 1 h of hands-on time.","['Yang, Yadong', 'Ding, Nan', 'Dong, Xunong', 'Fang, Xiangdong']","['Yang Y', 'Ding N', 'Dong X', 'Fang X']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.1-104 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.1-104 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.1-104 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.1-104 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China. fangxd@big.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods', 'Software']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1465:207-17. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_17.,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Differential expression', '*Sequencing', '*Target', '*miRNome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, mouse models of CML have greatly facilitated the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of this disease and have led to the identification of new drug targets that in some cases offer the possibility of functional cure. There are currently three established CML mouse models: the BCR-ABL transgenic model, the BCR-ABL retroviral transduction/transplantation model, and the xenotransplant immunodeficient model. Each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the question of interest, some models may be more appropriate than others. In this chapter, we describe a newly developed xenotransplant mouse model to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination. The model facilitates the evaluation of the frequency of leukemic stem cells with long-term leukemia-initiating activity, a critical subcellular population that causes disease relapse and progression, through the utilization of primary CD34(+) CML stem/progenitor cells obtained from CML patients at diagnosis and prior to drug treatment. We have also investigated the effectiveness of new combination treatment strategies designed to prevent the development of leukemia in vivo using BCR-ABL (+) blast crisis cells as a model system. These types of in vivo studies are important for the prediction of individual patient responses to drug therapy, and have the potential to facilitate the design of personalized combination therapy strategies.","['Lin, Hanyang', 'Woolfson, Adrian', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Lin H', 'Woolfson A', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1L3.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Pfizer Oncology, Pfizer, Inc, New York, NY, USA.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1L3. xjiang@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1465:187-205. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_16.,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL + blast crisis cells', '*CD34+ CML stem/progenitor cells', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*Drug efficacy', '*Engraftment', '*Immunodeficient mice', '*Intravenous injection', '*Oral gavage', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor', '*Xenotransplant mouse model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, autophagy plays a vital role in determining cell fate and is central for homeostasis and pathogenesis of many human diseases including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It has been well established that autophagy is important for the leukemogenesis as well as drug resistance in CML. Thus, autophagy is an intriguing therapeutic target. However, current approaches that detect autophagy lack reliability and often fail to provide quantitative measurements. To overcome this hurdle and facilitate the development of autophagy-related therapies, we have recently developed an autophagy assay termed as the Cyto-ID fluorescence spectrophotometric assay. This method uses a cationic fluorescence dye, Cyto-ID, which specifically labels autophagic compartments and is detected by a spectrophotometer to permit a large-scale and quantitative analysis. As such, it allows rapid, reliable, and quantitative detection of autophagy and estimation of autophagy flux. In this chapter, we further provide technical details of this method and step-by-step protocols for measuring autophagy or autophagy flux in CML cell lines as well as primary hematopoietic cells.","['Guo, Sujuan', 'Pridham, Kevin J', 'Sheng, Zhi']","['Guo S', 'Pridham KJ', 'Sheng Z']","['Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, Roanoke, VA, 24016, USA.', 'Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, Roanoke, VA, 24016, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, USA.', 'Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, Roanoke, VA, 24016, USA. zhisheng@vtc.vt.edu.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, USA. zhisheng@vtc.vt.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, Roanoke, VA, 24016, USA. zhisheng@vtc.vt.edu.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, USA. zhisheng@vtc.vt.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",,,2016/09/02 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/09/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1465:95-109. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-4011-0_9.,,['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Cyto-ID autophagy assay', '*Cyto-ID fluorescence spectrophotometric assay']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic-phase CML patients are treated with impressive efficacy with TK inhibitors (TKi) such as imatinib mesylate (IM). However, rather than definitively curing CML, TKi induces a state of minimal residual disease, due to the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSC) which are insensitive to this class of drugs. LSC persistence may be due to different reasons, including the suppression of BCR/Abl oncoprotein. It has been shown that this suppression follows incubation in low oxygen under appropriate culture conditions and incubation times.Here we describe the culture repopulation ability (CRA) assay, a non-clonogenic assay capable - together with incubation in low oxygen - to reveal in vitro stem cells endowed with marrow repopulation ability (MRA) in vivo. The CRA assay can be used, before moving to animal tests, as a simple and reliable method for the prescreening of drugs potentially active on CML and other leukemias with respect to their activity on the more immature leukemia cell subsets.","['Cheloni, Giulia', 'Tanturli, Michele']","['Cheloni G', 'Tanturli M']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Section of Experimental and Clinical Oncology, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, viale GB Morgagni, 50-50134, Florence, Italy. giulia.cheloni@unifi.it.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Section of Clinical Physiopathology, viale G.

Studies on CML have led to the identification of the first cancer-associated chromosomal abnormality and the subsequent development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity in CML. It has become clear that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML are insensitive to inhibition by TKIs, and eradication of LSCs appears to be difficult. Therefore, some of the major issues in current CML therapy are to understand the biology of LSCs and to investigate why LSCs are insensitive to TKIs for developing curative therapeutic strategies.

The virus is highly prevalent: 60-80 % of adults are seropositive; however, cells permissive for MCPyV infection are unknown. Consequently, very little information about the MCPyV life cycle is available. Until recently, MCPyV replication could only be studied using a semi-permissive in vitro replication system (Neumann et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2011, Schowalter et al., 2011). MCPyV replication most likely depends on subnuclear structures such as promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which are known to play regulatory roles in the infection of many DNA viruses. Here, we investigated PML-NB components as candidate host factors to control MCPyV DNA replication. We showed that PML-NBs change in number and size in cells actively replicating MCPyV proviral DNA. We observed a significant increase in PML-NBs in cells positive for MCPyV viral DNA replication. Interestingly, a significant amount of cells actively replicating MCPyV did not show any Sp100 expression.

PTG may be associated with family/home and health care dynamics, as well as parental resilience, distress, and coping. This cross-sectional study investigated the associations of psychosocial factors of the patient, family, and health care team with PTG and illness-related burden (IRB) in childhood cancer survivors. The sample comprised 61 children and adolescents (7-18 years of age), their parents, and their nurses. Respondents completed their assessment an average of 1.73 years after the end of treatment for the child's disease, which was either leukemia, a solid tumor, or lymphoma. Regression analyses showed that PTG was positively associated with the patients' posttraumatic stress symptoms. It was also positively associated with the parents' religious coping, and with measures of stronger family and oncologist relationships (R(2) = .32). IRB was positively associated with patient-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms, negatively associated with the nurse's trust in the family, and positively associated with parent-reported mental distress, lower family socioeconomic status, and female gender (R(2) = .53). There was no significant association with parenting style or parent-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms in the child. The findings suggested that the young cancer patient's psychosocial and resource milieu (e.g., financial) may be instrumental in PTG and IRB. Psychosocial interventions with high-risk families and their health care teams could increase growth and reduce burden.","['Wilson, J Zachary', 'Marin, Donna', 'Maxwell, Katherine', 'Cumming, Joseph', 'Berger, Ryan', 'Saini, Shermini', 'Ferguson, William', 'Chibnall, John T']","['Wilson JZ', 'Marin D', 'Maxwell K', 'Cumming J', 'Berger R', 'Saini S', 'Ferguson W', 'Chibnall JT']","['Department of Psychiatry, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. chibnajt@slu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160831,United States,J Trauma Stress,Journal of traumatic stress,8809259,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology', 'Nurses/psychology', 'Parents/psychology', '*Resilience, Psychological', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jts.22123 [doi]'],ppublish,J Trauma Stress. 2016 Oct;29(5):448-456. doi: 10.1002/jts.22123.

Furthermore, survival outcomes from developing countries are reported to be inferior to developed nations. We hypothesized that risk- and response-based outcome in high-income resource-rich developing countries would be comparable to developed nations as access to care and supportive measures would be similar. A total of 193 children diagnosed with de novo AML between January 2005 and December 2012 were identified, of those 175 were evaluable for outcome. Patients were stratified into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR), or high-risk (HR) groups. The complete remission (CR), early death, and induction failure rates were: 85.7%, 2.3%, and 12%; respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 43.1% and 9.8% respectively; overall survival (OS) was 58.8+/-4% and event-free survival (EFS) 40.9+/-4.1%. The 5-year OS for LR, IR, and HR groups were 72.0+/-6.9%, 59.8+/-6.2%, and 45.1+/-7.4%; respectively (p=0.003); and EFS 50.5+/-8.0%, 46.3+/-6.4%, and 23.3+/-6.4%; respectively (p=0.001). This study demonstrated comparable outcomes to those reported from developed countries. This suggests that utilization of risk- and response-based protocols in developing countries can overcome ethnic and geographic variation, if access to care and supportive measures were similar.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Al Ghemlas, Ibrahim', 'Al Daama, Saad', 'Ballourah, Walid', 'Bayoumy, Mohammad', 'Al-Anzi, Faisal', 'Al Shareef, Omar', 'Alsultan, Abdulrahman', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan', 'Al Sudairy, Reem']","['Jastaniah W', 'Al Ghemlas I', 'Al Daama S', 'Ballourah W', 'Bayoumy M', 'Al-Anzi F', 'Al Shareef O', 'Alsultan A', 'Abrar MB', 'Al Sudairy R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia; Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Exploiting CD45 KO mice and lentiviral shRNA, we prove the crucial role that CD45 plays in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and maintenance. We discovered that CD45 does not colocalize with lipid rafts on murine and human non-transformed hematopoietic cells. Using a mouse model, we proved that CD45 positioning within lipid rafts is modified during their oncogenic transformation to AML. CD45 colocalized with lipid rafts on AML cells, which contributes to elevated GM-CSF signal intensity involved in proliferation of leukemic cells. We furthermore proved that the GM-CSF/Lyn/Stat3 pathway that contributes to growth of leukemic cells could be profoundly affected, by using a new plasma membrane disrupting agent, which rapidly delocalized CD45 away from lipid rafts. We provide evidence that this mechanism is also effective on human primary AML samples and xenograft transplantation. In conclusion, this study highlights the emerging evidence of the involvement of lipid rafts in oncogenic development of AML and the targeting of CD45 positioning among lipid rafts as a new strategy in the treatment of AML.","['Saint-Paul, Laetitia', 'Nguyen, Chi-Hung', 'Buffiere, Anne', 'Pais de Barros, Jean-Paul', 'Hammann, Arlette', 'Landras-Guetta, Corinne', 'Filomenko, Rodolphe', 'Chretien, Marie-Lorraine', 'Johnson, Pauline', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel', 'Delva, Laurent', 'Quere, Ronan']","['Saint-Paul L', 'Nguyen CH', 'Buffiere A', 'Pais de Barros JP', 'Hammann A', 'Landras-Guetta C', 'Filomenko R', 'Chretien ML', 'Johnson P', 'Bastie JN', 'Delva L', 'Quere R']","['Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, UMR9187-U1196, CNRS-Institut Curie, Inserm, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'Plateforme de lipidomique, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'Plateforme de cytometrie, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, UMR9187-U1196, CNRS-Institut Curie, Inserm, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'INRA, UMR1324, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', ""Hopital Universitaire Francois-Mitterrand, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Dijon, France."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', ""Hopital Universitaire Francois-Mitterrand, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Dijon, France."", 'Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR866, Universite Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC Labex, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5323116,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['11622 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11622 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 4;7(40):64785-64797. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11622.,,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45 phosphatase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic cells', 'lipid rafts', 'oncogenic transformation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation centers (PC) in lymph nodes and bone marrow offer protection against many cytotoxic drugs and circulating CLL cells were found to acquire resistance to DEX-mediated killing in conditions encountered in PCs including stimulation by toll-like receptor agonists and interactions with stromal cells. The resistant state was associated with impaired glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene expression, autocrine activation of STAT3 through Janus Kinases (JAKs), and increased glycolysis. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib blocked STAT3-phosphorylation and partially improved DEX-mediated killing of stimulated CLL cells in vitro but not in CLL patients in vivo. An automated microscopy-based screen of a kinase inhibitor library implicated an additional protective role for the PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathway. Blocking this pathway with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or the PI3K-inhibitors idelalisib and buparlisib increased DEX-mediated killing but did not block STAT3-phosphorylation. Combining idelalisib or buparlisib with ruxolitinib greatly increased killing by DEX. These observations suggest that glucocorticoid resistance in CLL cells may be overcome by combining JAK and PI3K inhibitors.","['Oppermann, Sina', 'Lam, Avery J', 'Tung, Stephanie', 'Shi, Yonghong', 'McCaw, Lindsay', 'Wang, Guizhei', 'Ylanko, Jarkko', 'Leber, Brian', 'Andrews, David', 'Spaner, David E']","['Oppermann S', 'Lam AJ', 'Tung S', 'Shi Y', 'McCaw L', 'Wang G', 'Ylanko J', 'Leber B', 'Andrews D', 'Spaner DE']","['Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5341931,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/03/17 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['11618 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11618 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 8;7(45):72608-72621. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11618.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FOXO', 'STAT3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cytokines', 'glucocorticoids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are effectively treated with imatinib, even though underrepresented in clinical studies. Furthermore, as it happens in the general population, they often receive multiple drugs for associated chronic illnesses. Aim of this study was to assess whether or not in imatinib-treated patients aged >75 years the exposure to polypharmacy (5 drugs or more) had an impact on cytogenetic and molecular response rates, event-free and overall survival, as well as on hematological or extra-hematological toxicity. METHODS: 296 patients at 35 Italian hematological institutions were evaluated. RESULTS: Polypharmacy was reported in 107 patients (36.1%), and drugs more frequently used were antiplatelets, diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin II receptors blockers, statins, oral hypoglycemic drugs and alpha blockers. Complete cytogenetic response was obtained in 174 patients (58.8%), 78 (26.4%) within 6 month, 63 (21.3%) between 7 and 12 months. Major molecular response was obtained in 153 patients (51.7%), 64 (21.6%) within the 12 month. One hundred and twenty-eight cases (43.2%) of hematological toxicity were recorded, together with 167 cases (56.4%) of extra-hematological toxicity. Comparing patients exposed to polypharmacy to those without, no difference was observed pertaining to the dosage of imatinib, cytogenetic and molecular responses and hematological and extra-hematological toxicity. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding the several interactions reported in the literature between imatinib and some of the medications considered herewith, this fact does not seem to have a clinical impact on response rate and outcome.","['Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Nobili, Alessandro', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Mansueto, Giovanna', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Storti, Sergio', ""D'Addosio, Ada M"", 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Cortesi, Laura', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Rossi, Antonella Russo', 'Avanzini, Paolo', 'Mauro, Endri', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Celesti, Francesca', 'Giglio, Gianfranco', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Calistri, Elisabetta', 'Sora, Federica', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Sica, Simona', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Orlandi, Ester M', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Tettamanti, Mauro', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Mannucci, Pier Mannuccio', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Iurlo A', 'Nobili A', 'Latagliata R', 'Bucelli C', 'Castagnetti F', 'Breccia M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Cattaneo D', 'Fava C', 'Ferrero D', 'Gozzini A', 'Bonifacio M', 'Tiribelli M', 'Pregno P', 'Stagno F', 'Vigneri P', 'Annunziata M', 'Cavazzini F', 'Binotto G', 'Mansueto G', 'Russo S', 'Falzetti F', 'Montefusco E', 'Gugliotta G', 'Storti S', ""D'Addosio AM"", 'Scaffidi L', 'Cortesi L', 'Cedrone M', 'Rossi AR', 'Avanzini P', 'Mauro E', 'Spadea A', 'Celesti F', 'Giglio G', 'Isidori A', 'Crugnola M', 'Calistri E', 'Sora F', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Sica S', 'Luciano L', 'Galimberti S', 'Orlandi EM', 'Bocchia M', 'Tettamanti M', 'Alimena G', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Mannucci PM', 'Cortelezzi A']","[""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda - Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Neuroscience, IRCCS - Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University ""La Sapienza"" of Rome, Rome, Italy.', ""Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda - Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", 'Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

In this work, we investigated effects of phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), a phytochemical with chemopreventive and anti-cancer activity, on mRNA translation. PEITC rapidly inhibited global mRNA translation in human breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In addition to the known inhibitory effects of PEITC on mTORC1 activity, we demonstrate that PEITC increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation. PEITC also increased formation of stress granules which are typically associated with eIF2alpha phosphorylation and accumulation of translationally stalled mRNAs. Analysis of genetically modified MEFs demonstrated that optimal inhibition of global mRNA translation by PEITC was dependent on eIF2alpha phosphorylation, but not mTORC1 inhibition. We extended this study into primary leukemic B cells derived from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). CLL cells were stimulated in vitro with anti-IgM to mimic binding of antigen, a major driver of this leukemia. In CLL cells, PEITC increased eIF2alpha phosphorylation, inhibited anti-IgM-induced mTORC1 activation and decreased both basal and anti-IgM-induced global mRNA translation. PEITC also inhibited transcription and translation of MYC mRNA and accumulation of the MYC oncoprotein, in anti-IgM-stimulated cells. Moreover, treatment of CLL cells with PEITC and the BTK kinase inhibitor ibrutinib decreased anti-IgM-induced translation and induced cell death to a greater extent than either agent alone. Therefore, PEITC can inhibit both global and mRNA specific translation (including MYC) via effects on multiple regulatory pathways. Inhibition of mRNA translation may contribute to the chemopreventive and anti-cancer effects of PEITC.","['Yeomans, Alison', 'Lemm, Elizabeth', 'Wilmore, Sarah', 'Cavell, Breeze E', 'Valle-Argos, Beatriz', 'Krysov, Sergey', 'Hidalgo, Marina Sanchez', 'Leonard, Elodie', 'Willis, Anne E', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Coldwell, Mark J', 'Packham, Graham']","['Yeomans A', 'Lemm E', 'Wilmore S', 'Cavell BE', 'Valle-Argos B', 'Krysov S', 'Hidalgo MS', 'Leonard E', 'Willis AE', 'Forconi F', 'Stevenson FK', 'Steele AJ', 'Coldwell MJ', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Current Address: Public Health England, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', ""Current Address: Bart's Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."", 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Current Address: Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Seville, Seville, Spain.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Current Address: XPE Pharma and Science, Wavre, Belgium.', 'MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester, UK.', 'Haematology Oncology Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Faculty of Medicine, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Centre for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC5342703,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['11655 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11655 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 15;7(46):74807-74819. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11655.,"['13-0267/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A600_1023/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (anti-IgM)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MYC', 'eIF2alpha', 'mRNA translation', 'mTORC1', 'phenethylisothiocyanate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified all patients with ET diagnosed during 2001 to 2011 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 18 database. Actuarial and relative survival methods were used to calculate the survival statistics. We utilized the SEER 13 database to calculate SPM. We used multiple primary standardized incidence ratio (SIR) session of the SEER*Stat software (version 8.1.5) to calculate SIR and excess risk of SPM for ET patients. RESULTS: Age standardized five-year cause-specific survival was greater for patients < 50 years vs those >/= 50 years (99.4% vs 93.5%, P < 0.01). Five-year cause-specific survival was lower for men vs women (70.2% vs 79.7%). A total of 201 patients (2.46%) developed SPM at a median age of 75 years. SPMs occurred at an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 1.26 (95%CI: 1.09-1.45, P = 0.002) with an absolute excess risk (AER) of 37.44 per 10000 population. A significantly higher risk was noted for leukemia (O/E 3.78; 95%CI: 2.20-6.05, P < 0.001; AER 11.28/10000).

Myokines are skeletal muscle-derived humoral cytokines and growth factors, which exert physiological and pathological functions in various distant organs, including the regulation of glucose, energy and bone metabolism. Myostatin is a crucial myokine, the expression of which is mainly limited to muscle tissues. The inhibition of myostatin signaling increases bone remodeling, bone mass and muscle mass, and it may provide a target for the treatment of both sarcopenia and osteoporosis. As myostatin is involved in osteoclast formation and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis, myostatin may be a target myokine for the treatment of accelerated bone resorption and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. Numerous other myokines, including transforming growth factor-beta, follistatin, insulin-like growth factor-I, fibroblast growth factor-2, osteoglycin, FAM5C, irisin, interleukin (IL)-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-7, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ciliary neurotrophic factor, osteonectin and matrix metalloproteinase 2, also affect bone cells in various manners. However, the effects of myokines on bone metabolism are largely unknown.

Embryonic ectoderm development (EED), an essential component of PRC2, interacts with trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) through the aromatic cage structure composed of its three aromatic amino acids, Phe97, Trp364, and Tyr365. This interaction allosterically activates the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 and thereby propagates repressive histone marks. In this study, we report the analysis of knock-in mice harboring the myeloid disorder-associated EED Ile363Met (I363M) mutation, analogous to the EED aromatic cage mutants. The I363M homozygotes displayed a remarkable and preferential reduction of H3K27me3 and died at midgestation. The heterozygotes increased the clonogenic capacity and bone marrow repopulating activity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and were susceptible to leukemia. Lgals3, a PRC2 target gene encoding a multifunctional galactose-binding lectin, was derepressed in I363M heterozygotes, which enhanced the stemness of HSPCs. Thus, our work provides in vivo evidence that the structural integrity of EED to H3K27me3 propagation is critical, especially for embryonic development and hematopoietic homeostasis, and that its perturbation increases the predisposition to hematologic malignancies.","['Ueda, Takeshi', 'Nakata, Yuichiro', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Sera, Yasuyuki', 'Sasaki, Masato', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Honda, Zen-Ichiro', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Honda, Hiroaki']","['Ueda T', 'Nakata Y', 'Nagamachi A', 'Yamasaki N', 'Kanai A', 'Sera Y', 'Sasaki M', 'Matsui H', 'Honda Z', 'Oda H', 'Wolff L', 'Inaba T', 'Honda H']","['Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan; takeshiueda@med.kindai.ac.jp hhonda@hiroshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Division of Infection and Host Defense, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai 981-8558, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Health Care Center and Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Institute of Environmental Science for Human Life, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo 112-8611, Japan;', ""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan;"", 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan; takeshiueda@med.kindai.ac.jp hhonda@hiroshima-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160830,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Galectin 3/chemistry/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*chemistry/genetics']",PMC5027452,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2016/09/01 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1600070113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1600070113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 13;113(37):10370-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1600070113.

Anti-telomerase drugs might be effective in suppressing tumour growth in approximately 85-90% of telomerase-positive cancer cells. However, there are still chances for these cells to bypass drug treatment after switching to the ALT mechanism to maintain their telomere integrity. But the mechanism underlying this switch is unknown. In this study, we used telomerase-positive cancer cells (HTC75) to discover the mechanism of the telomerase-ALT switch by inducing telomere-specific DNA damage, alpha-thalassemia X-linked syndrome protein (ATRX) knockdown and deletion of death associated protein (DAXX). Surprisingly, two important ALT hallmarks in the ALT-like HTC75 cells were observed after treatments: ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (APBs) and extrachromosomal circular DNA of telomeric repeats. Moreover, knocking out hTERT by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 technique led to telomere elongation in a telomerase-independent manner in ALT-like HTC75 cells. In summary, this is the first report to show that inducing telomeric DNA damage, disrupting the ATRX/DAXX complex and inhibiting telomerase activity in telomerase-positive cancer cells lead to the ALT switch.","['Hu, Yang', 'Shi, Guang', 'Zhang, Laichen', 'Li, Feng', 'Jiang, Yuanling', 'Jiang, Shuai', 'Ma, Wenbin', 'Zhao, Yong', 'Songyang, Zhou', 'Huang, Junjiu']","['Hu Y', 'Shi G', 'Zhang L', 'Li F', 'Jiang Y', 'Jiang S', 'Ma W', 'Zhao Y', 'Songyang Z', 'Huang J']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine of Guangdong Province, School of Life Sciences and the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine of Guangdong Province, School of Life Sciences and the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine of Guangdong Province, School of Life Sciences and the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education and Institute of Healthy Aging Research, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine of Guangdong Province, School of Life Sciences and the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160831,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*physiology', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism', '*Telomere Homeostasis', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein/*metabolism']",PMC5006076,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['srep32280 [pii]', '10.1038/srep32280 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 31;6:32280. doi: 10.1038/srep32280.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to reduce pain and anxiety, PEG-ASP has increasingly been delivered via intravenous (IV) administration. The study objective was to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to compare and generate pooled hypersensitivity rates for IM and IV PEG-ASP. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for all epidemiological studies that investigated IV and IM hypersensitivity rates for pediatric ALL. Included studies were critically appraised using the GRACE checklist. Pooled estimates and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for IM and IV hypersensitivity rates were derived based on either a random or fixed effects model. RESULTS: Four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and were of adequate quality. The random effects pooled hypersensitivity rates were 23.5% (95% CI 14.7-33.7) and 8.7% (95% CI 5.4-12.8) for IV and IM, respectively. The fixed effects pooled odds ratio after adjusting for publication bias was 2.49 (95% CI 1.62-3.83), indicating a significantly higher risk of hypersensitivity for IV over IM PEG-ASP. This risk is far more pronounced for high-risk (HR) patients compared with standard-risk (SR) patients (IV vs. IM: HR upward arrow35.2% and SR downward arrow2.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Although administering PEG-ASP through IV is preferable for patients, it poses a significantly higher risk of hypersensitivity when compared with IM administration, especially for HR patients.

Correspondingly, it might be beneficial to also integrate complementary information from different molecular levels when building multivariable risk prediction models for a clinical endpoint, such as treatment response or survival. Unfortunately, such a high-dimensional modeling task will often be complicated by a limited overlap of molecular measurements at different levels between patients, i.e. measurements from all molecular levels are available only for a smaller proportion of patients. RESULTS: We propose a sequential strategy for building clinical risk prediction models that integrate genome-wide measurements from two molecular levels in a complementary way. To deal with partial overlap, we develop an imputation approach that allows us to use all available data. This approach is investigated in two acute myeloid leukemia applications combining gene expression with either SNP or DNA methylation data. After obtaining a sparse risk prediction signature e.g. from SNP data, an automatically selected set of prognostic SNPs, by componentwise likelihood-based boosting, imputation is performed for the corresponding linear predictor by a linking model that incorporates e.g. gene expression measurements. The imputed linear predictor is then used for adjustment when building a prognostic signature from the gene expression data. For evaluation, we consider stability, as quantified by inclusion frequencies across resampling data sets. Despite an extremely small overlap in the application example with gene expression and SNPs, several genes are seen to be more stably identified when taking the (imputed) linear predictor from the SNP data into account. In the application with gene expression and DNA methylation, prediction performance with respect to survival also indicates that the proposed approach might work well. CONCLUSIONS: We consider imputation of linear predictor values to be a feasible and sensible approach for dealing with partial overlap in complementary integrative analysis of molecular measurements at different levels. More generally, these results indicate that a complementary strategy for integrating different molecular levels can result in more stable risk prediction signatures, potentially providing a more reliable insight into the underlying biology.","['Hieke, Stefanie', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schlenl, Richard F', 'Schumacher, Martin', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Binder, Harald']","['Hieke S', 'Benner A', 'Schlenl RF', 'Schumacher M', 'Bullinger L', 'Binder H']","['Institute for Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Stefan-Meier-Str. 26, Freiburg, 79104, Germany. hieke@imbi.uni-freiburg.de.', 'Freiburg Center for Data Analysis and Modeling, University Freiburg, Eckerstr. 1, Freiburg, 79104, Germany. hieke@imbi.uni-freiburg.de.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm, 89081, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Stefan-Meier-Str. 26, Freiburg, 79104, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm, 89081, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Str. 69, Mainz, 55131, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160830,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Risk']",PMC5004308,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2015/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-016-1183-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-016-1183-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Aug 30;17(1):327. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1183-6.,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1810-9149'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Boosting', 'Multiple genome-wide data sets', 'Multivariable model', 'Risk prediction', 'Time-to-event endpoint']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about miR-34c expression and the impact on prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze the status of miR-34c expression in 122 patients with de novo AML and 62 normal controls. RESULTS: MiR-34c expression in AML was significantly downregulated compared to controls (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) indicated the distinguishing value of miR-34c for discriminating whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients from healthy controls. No significant differences were found between low miR-34c-expressing and high miR-34c-expressing patients in age, sex, hemoglobin, platelet count, percentage of blasts in bone marrow (BM), WHO classifications, karyotypes, and eight gene mutations, but low miR-34c cases had higher white blood cells (WBC) than high miR-34c cases (P = 0.035). MiR-34c low-expressed patients had similar rates of complete remission (CR) as miR-34c high-expressed patients in whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and CN-AML patients (P = 0.347, 0.314 and 0.167, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with low miR-34c level had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) time in whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and CN-AML patients (P = 0.033, 0.024 and 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed that low miR-34c expression was an independent risk factor not only in whole-cohort AML (P = 0.040) but also in non-M3 AML (P = 0.015) and CN-AML patients (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that low miR-34c level is a novel promising biomarker in predicting prognosis in patients with de novo AML.","['Yang, D-Q', 'Zhou, J-D', 'Wang, Y-X', 'Deng, Z-Q', 'Yang, J', 'Yao, D-M', 'Qian, Z', 'Yang, L', 'Lin, J', 'Qian, J']","['Yang DQ', 'Zhou JD', 'Wang YX', 'Deng ZQ', 'Yang J', 'Yao DM', 'Qian Z', 'Yang L', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160831,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12566 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Feb;39(1):42-50. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12566.

Recently, few studies reported on an inherited nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 15 (NUDT15) c.415C>T low-function variant that is associated with decreased thiopurine metabolism and leukopenia in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other diseases. PROCEDURES: The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms and assess whether they are predictors of MP intolerance in children treated for ALL. One hundred thirty-seven patients with ALL of whom 121 were Lebanese were evaluated. MP dose intensity was calculated as the ratio of the tolerated MP dose to planned dose during continuation phase to maintain an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) dose above 300 per mul. RESULTS: One patient was NUDT15 heterozygous TC and tolerated only 33.33% of the planned MP dose, which was statistically significantly different from the median-tolerated MP dose intensity of the rest of the cohort (76.00%). Three patients had the TPMT*3A haplotype and tolerated 40.00-66.66% of the planned MP dose, which was also statistically significantly different from the rest of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the association of TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms with MP dose intolerance in Arab patients with ALL. Genotyping for additional polymorphisms may be warranted for potential gene/allele-dose effect.","['Zgheib, Nathalie K', 'Akika, Reem', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Aridi, Carol Al', 'Ghanem, Khaled M', 'Saab, Raya', 'Abboud, Miguel R', 'Tarek, Nidale', 'El Solh, Hassan', 'Muwakkit, Samar A']","['Zgheib NK', 'Akika R', 'Mahfouz R', 'Aridi CA', 'Ghanem KM', 'Saab R', 'Abboud MR', 'Tarek N', 'El Solh H', 'Muwakkit SA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, American University of Beirut, Faculty of Medicine, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, American University of Beirut, Faculty of Medicine, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Institute, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160831,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Lebanon', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26189 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Jan;64(1):146-150. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26189.

As a result, patients often find that they must coordinate care on their own. Coordinated delivery teams may address these challenges and improve quality of cancer care. Task interdependence is a core principle of rigorous teamwork and is essential to addressing the complexity of cancer care, which is highly interdependent across specialties and modalities. We examined challenges faced by a patient with early-stage breast cancer that resulted from difficulties in understanding and managing task interdependence across clinical domains involved in this patient's care. We used team science supported by the project management discipline to discuss how various task interdependence aspects can be recognized, deliberately designed, and systematically managed to prevent care breakdowns. This case highlights how effective task interdependence management facilitated by project management methods could markedly improve the course of a patient's care. This work informs efforts of cancer centers and practices to redesign cancer care delivery through innovative, practical, and patient-centered approaches to management of task interdependence in cancer care. Future patient-reported outcomes research will help to determine optimal ways to engage patients, including those who are medically underserved, in managing task interdependence in their own care.","['Trosman, Julia R', 'Carlos, Ruth C', 'Simon, Melissa A', 'Madden, Debra L', 'Gradishar, William J', 'Benson, Al B 3rd', 'Rapkin, Bruce D', 'Weiss, Elisa S', 'Gareen, Ilana F', 'Wagner, Lynne I', 'Khan, Seema A', 'Bunce, Mikele M', 'Small, Art', 'Weldon, Christine B']","['Trosman JR', 'Carlos RC', 'Simon MA', 'Madden DL', 'Gradishar WJ', 'Benson AB 3rd', 'Rapkin BD', 'Weiss ES', 'Gareen IF', 'Wagner LI', 'Khan SA', 'Bunce MM', 'Small A', 'Weldon CB']","['Center for Business Models in Healthcare;

However, the effect of R-2HG released by IDH-mutated AML cells on the bone marrow microenvironment is unclear. Here, we report that R-2HG induces IkappaB kinase-independent activation of NF-kappaB in bone marrow stromal cells. R-2HG acts via a reactive oxygen species/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway to phosphorylate NF-kappaB on the Thr254 residue. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction of NF-kappaB and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase PIN1 and increases the protein stability and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. As a consequence, R-2HG enhances NF-kappaB-dependent expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and complement 5a to stimulate proliferation of AML cells. In addition, R-2HG also upregulates vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 and CXCR4 in stromal cells to enhance the contact between AML and stromal cells and attenuates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. More importantly, we validated the R-2HG-activated gene signature in the primary bone marrow stromal cells isolated from IDH-mutated AML patients. Collectively, our results suggest that AML cell-derived R-2HG may be helpful for the establishment of a supportive bone marrow stromal niche to promote AML progression via paracrine stimulation.","['Chen, Jing-Yi', 'Lai, You-Syuan', 'Tsai, Hui-Jen', 'Kuo, Cheng-Chin', 'Yen, B Linju', 'Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Sun, H Sunny', 'Hung, Wen-Chun']","['Chen JY', 'Lai YS', 'Tsai HJ', 'Kuo CC', 'Yen BL', 'Yeh SP', 'Sun HS', 'Hung WC']","['National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli 350, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli 350, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 704, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160831,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Complement C5a/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glutarates/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Junctional Adhesion Molecule B/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Paracrine Communication/*drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Stability', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5006242,,2016/09/01 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['srep32428 [pii]', '10.1038/srep32428 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 31;6:32428. doi: 10.1038/srep32428.,,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Glutarates)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Junctional Adhesion Molecule B)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

However, the mechanisms that underlie the susceptibility or resistance to nelarabine have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of nelarabine transport and metabolism in the context of nelarabine cytotoxicity. PROCEDURE: The expression profiles of six genes in the nelarabine pathway were analyzed in blast cells from six patients with T-ALL as well as in three T-ALL cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity (LC50 of 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosylguanine [ara-G]) was evaluated. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of ENT1, DCK, CDA, NT5C2, RRM1, and RRM2 in patients showed inter-individual variability and was not correlated with the LC50 of ara-G. However, the ratio of (ENT1 x DCK)/(CDA x RRM1) expression was significantly correlated with LC50 (r = -0.831, P = 0.0405). CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitivity to nelarabine is influenced by the balance of the expression of these four genes, and the ratio of their expression predicts the response of T-cell malignancies to nelarabine.","['Sripornsawan, Pornpun', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Nishikawa, Takuro', 'Kodama, Yuichi', 'Yamaki, Yuni', 'Kurauchi, Koichiro', 'Tanabe, Takayuki', 'Nakagawa, Shunsuke', 'Shinkoda, Yuichi', 'Imuta, Naoko', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi']","['Sripornsawan P', 'Okamoto Y', 'Nishikawa T', 'Kodama Y', 'Yamaki Y', 'Kurauchi K', 'Tanabe T', 'Nakagawa S', 'Shinkoda Y', 'Imuta N', 'Kawano Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160831,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Arabinonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26214 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Feb;64(2):250-253. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26214.

In this study, we investigated the Helios expression between Helicobacter pylori infection and prognosis in gastric cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 67 gastric cancer patients who received partial or full gastrectomies were enrolled. Helios expression by immunohistochemistry and mRNA was investigated with the clinical stage, Helicobacter pylori infection, CD4 expression, FoxP3 expression and prognosis. RESULTS: From the immunohistochemistry stain, we found that the Helios was expressed in both cancer cell and tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes. The high expression of Helios in gastric tumor cells had a better median overall survival rate in gastric cancer patients (50.7 +/- 3.2 vs. 34.1 +/- 4.9 months; P = 0.015), Helicobacter pylori-infected patients (51.1 +/- 3.5 vs. 30.4 +/- 5.1 months; P = 0.007) and advanced gastric cancer patients (42.1 +/- 5.5 vs. 23.2 +/- 4.8 months; P = 0.043). From multivariate analysis, the Helios expression in gastric tumor cells was an independent factor to predict better survival in all gastric cancers (HR = 2.78; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.09-7.09; P = 0.032) and advanced gastric cancer patients (HR = 2.85; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.00-8.13; P = 0.03).

We also used the replicative stress inducer Hydroxyurea (HU), a standard drug for leukemic patients, and the apoptosis inducer Staurosporine (STS). To assess cytotoxic effects of HDACi, we measured cell cycle profiles and DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry. Western blot was employed to analyze protein expression and phosphorylation. RESULTS: LBH589 and MS-275 induce proteolysis of ACK1 in CML and AML cells. Panobinostat more strongly induces apoptosis than Entinostat, and this correlates with a significantly pronounced loss of ACK1. STS and HU also propel the degradation of ACK1 in leukemic cells. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK reduces ACK1 degradation in the presence of HDACi. Concomitant with the attenuation of ACK1, we noticed decreased phosphorylation of STAT3. Direct inhibition of ACK1 with Dasatinib also suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Dasatinib and HDACi combinations are effective against CML cells. CONCLUSION: HDACs sustain the ACK1-STAT3 signaling node and leukemic cell growth. Consistent with their different effects on ACK1 stability or auto-phosphorylation, Dasatinib and HDACi combinations produce beneficial antileukemic effects.","['Mahendrarajah, Nisintha', 'Paulus, Ramin', 'Kramer, Oliver H']","['Mahendrarajah N', 'Paulus R', 'Kramer OH']","['Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131, Mainz, Germany. okraemer@uni-mainz.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160830,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Panobinostat', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2229-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2229-x [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Nov;142(11):2263-73. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2229-x.

However, little is known about the function of these HERV proteins or environmental factors which regulate their expression. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used very extensively as antimicrobials and antivirals in numerous consumer products although their effect on the expression of HERV gene products is unknown. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity assays were carried out on human acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia (MOLT-4) and Fanconi anaemia associated acute myeloid leukaemia (FA-AML1) cells treated with two different sizes of AgNPs (7nm and 50nm diameter). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were then used to the assess expression of HERV-W syncytin-1 mRNA and protein in these cells. FA-AML1 cells were more sensitive overall than MOLT-4 to treatment with the smaller 7nm sized AgNp's being the most toxic in these cells. MOLT-4 cell were more resistant and showed no evidence of differential toxicity to the different sized particles. Syncytin-1 mRNA and protein were induced by both 7 and 50nm AgNPs in both cell types yet with different kinetics. In summary, the observation that AgNPs induce expression of syncytin-1 in FA-AML1 and MOLT-4 cells at doses as little as 5 microg/ml is grounds for concern since this protein is up-regulated in both malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the widespread use of AgNPs in the environment it is clear that their ability to induce syncytin-1 should be investigated further in other cell types.","['Alqahtani, Sultan', 'Promtong, Pawika', 'Oliver, Anthony W', 'He, Xiaotong T', 'Walker, Thomas D', 'Povey, Andrew', 'Hampson, Lynne', 'Hampson, Ian N']","['Alqahtani S', 'Promtong P', 'Oliver AW', 'He XT', 'Walker TD', 'Povey A', 'Hampson L', 'Hampson IN']","['Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and.', 'Molecular Epidemiology, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.', 'Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and.', 'Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and.', 'Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and.', 'Molecular Epidemiology, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.', 'Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and.', 'Viral Oncology, Institute of Cancer Sciences and ian.hampson@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160830,England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, env/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Silver/pharmacology/*toxicity', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['gew043 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gew043 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2016 Nov;31(6):695-702. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gew043.

However, the effects of ATO on metastasis in chondrosarcoma cells, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: The effects of ATO on the migratory and invasive capacities of chondrosarcoma cells were investigated by Wound healing, Transwell and EMT assays. The expression of miR-125b in human chondrosarcoma tissues and cell lines was detected by real-time PCR analysis. Bisulfite sequencing analysis (BSP) was used to detect the effects of ATO on the expression of miR-125b. The gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed on chondrosarcoma cell lines to investigate the effects of miR-125b on chondrosarcoma invasion, and to determine whether signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(Stat3) mediates these effects. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify whether Stat3 is a direct target of miR-125b. RESULTS: MiR-125b was significantly downregulated in human metastatic chondrosarcoma tissues and cell lines but not in non-metastatic chondrosarcoma tissues. ATO up-regulates the expression of miR-125b by the demethylation of DNA. ATO induces MET and attenuates the invasive capacities of chondrosarcoma cells through miR-125b. Stat3 was verified as a direct target of miR-125b, which is involved in ATO regulating EMT-associated traits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings, for the first time, provides evidence that the miR-125b-mediated inhibition of Stat3 is involved in the ATO-induced attenuation of metastasis in chondrosarcoma cells.","['Bao, Xing', 'Ren, Tingting', 'Huang, Yi', 'Wang, Shidong', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Liu, Kuisheng', 'Zheng, Bingxin', 'Guo, Wei']","['Bao X', 'Ren T', 'Huang Y', 'Wang S', 'Zhang F', 'Liu K', 'Zheng B', 'Guo W']","[""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China. bonetumor@163.com."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Tumor, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China. bonetumor@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160830,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chondrosarcoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'DNA Demethylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5006509,,2016/09/01 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2016/09/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-016-0407-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-016-0407-y [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Aug 30;35(1):129. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0407-y.,,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arsenic trioxide (ATO)', '*Chondrosarcoma', '*Metastatsis', '*MicroRNA-125b', '*Signal transducer and activator of transcription3(Stat3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case series highlighting 10 years of experience with C. tertium as a cause of bacteremia in this population is presented; the cases were seen at a National Cancer Institute designated cancer center. METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to the start of the study. All cases of C. tertium bacteremia seen at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed. The study population was identified by positive blood cultures obtained from the microbiology laboratory over the same time period. RESULTS: Seven patients were found to have had C. tertium bacteremia. These patients had a temperature of >38.3 degrees C at the time of diagnosis and severe neutropenia. All patients had a history of hematological malignancy, five having acute myeloid leukemia and two having myelodysplastic syndrome. All of the patients' blood cultures cleared within </=3 days of antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The unusual susceptibility pattern of C. tertium, with resistance to beta-lactams and clindamycin, likely explains its presence in immunosuppressed patients. Vancomycin remains the drug of choice. The pathogen continues to have a low virulence and a low mortality when treated appropriately.","['Shah, Sweta', 'Hankenson, Jennifer', 'Pabbathi, Smitha', 'Greene, John', 'Nanjappa, Sowmya']","['Shah S', 'Hankenson J', 'Pabbathi S', 'Greene J', 'Nanjappa S']","['University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Internal Hospital Medicine, H.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of data for 187 adults with AML treated in the ICU in one institution revealed the following as independent prognostic factors for death in the ICU: arterial oxygen partial pressure below 72 mmHg, active AML and systemic inflammatory response syndrome upon ICU admission, and need for hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Based on these variables, we developed an ICU mortality score and validated the score in an independent cohort of 264 patients treated in the ICU in three additional tertiary hospitals. Compared with the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, the Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, our score yielded a better prediction of ICU mortality in the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis (AUC = 0.913 vs. AUC = 0.710 [SAPS II], AUC = 0.708 [LOD], and 0.770 [SOFA] in the training cohort; AUC = 0.841 for the developed score vs. AUC = 0.730 [SAPSII], AUC = 0.773 [LOD], and 0.783 [SOFA] in the validation cohort). Factors predicting decreased survival after ICU discharge were as follows: relapse or refractory disease, previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation, time between hospital admission and ICU admission, time spent in ICU, impaired diuresis, Glasgow Coma Scale <8 and hematocrit of >/=25% at ICU admission. Based on these factors, an ICU survival score was created and used for risk stratification into three risk groups. This stratification discriminated distinct survival rates after ICU discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Our data emphasize that although individual risks differ widely depending on the patient and disease status, a substantial portion of critically ill patients with AML benefit from intensive care.","['Pohlen, Michele', 'Thoennissen, Nils H', 'Braess, Jan', 'Thudium, Johannes', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Kochanek, Matthias', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Lebiedz, Pia', 'Gorlich, Dennis', 'Gerth, Hans U', 'Rohde, Christian', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Hullermann, Carsten', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Schlimok, Gunter', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Waltenberger, Johannes', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Krug, Utz']","['Pohlen M', 'Thoennissen NH', 'Braess J', 'Thudium J', 'Schmid C', 'Kochanek M', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Lebiedz P', 'Gorlich D', 'Gerth HU', 'Rohde C', 'Kessler T', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Stelljes M', 'Hullermann C', 'Buchner T', 'Schlimok G', 'Hallek M', 'Waltenberger J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Berdel WE', 'Heilmeier B', 'Krug U']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine D, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160830,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Organ Dysfunction Scores', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*epidemiology', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",PMC5004890,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/08/31 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0160871 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-01462 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 30;11(8):e0160871. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0160871. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2018 Jan 2;13(1):e0190802.

Seven organ recipients from two different donors developed lymphoproliferative disease. The origin of the malignancy was determined by use of microsatellite analysis, and the plasma of the two donors was analyzed with the use of electrophoresis. The clinical courses of the seven recipients were followed for 36-60 months. One donor transmitted lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma to two kidney recipients and MGUS to a liver recipient, all IgMkappa. A second donor caused IgGlambda myeloma in two kidney and one liver recipient, and IgGlambda gammopathy in a heart recipient. Transplant nephrectomy was performed in three kidney recipients and remission was achieved. The fourth kidney recipient has kept the graft and the disease has progressed. The liver recipient died from myeloma.

PG-free melphalan (Evomela; Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Irvine CA) overcomes these limitations by using the solubilizing agent Captisol (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., LaJolla CA) to improve the stability of the reconstituted melphalan and avoid the potential toxicities of PG. This phase II study investigated the safety and efficacy of high-dose PG-free melphalan when included in the carmustine, etoposide, and cytarabine (BEAM) regimen for adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Carmustine, etoposide, and cytarabine were given at standard doses on day -6 through day -3. PG-free melphalan, 140 mg/m(2), was infused over 30 minutes on day -2. The primary endpoint was toxicity. Fifty patients (33 NHL/17 HL) completed BEAM with PG-free melphalan and stem cell infusion. The most common grades 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicities were neutropenic fever (68%), infections (36%), and electrolyte abnormalities. Forty-one patients (82%) had oral mucositis, which was mostly grades 1 to 2 (6% grade 3). Moderate or severe gastrointestinal toxicities were uncommon. There were no treatment-related deaths. Forty-nine patients (98%) had neutrophil and platelet engraftment at a median of 10 and 19 days, respectively. At response assessment at 60 to 100 days after autologous stem cell transplantation, 42 patients (82%) were in complete remission, 2 in partial remission, and 6 had progressive disease. Progression-free survival at 1 year was 70%. These results demonstrate that PG-free melphalan can be used in place of the standard, lyophilized formulation of melphalan in the BEAM regimen for lymphoma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. It has a safety profile that compares favorably with standard lyophilized melphalan, and the engraftment rate and response rates were consistent with expectations.","['Cashen, Amanda F', 'Fletcher, Theresa', 'Ceriotti, Connie', 'Gao, Feng', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith', 'DiPersio, John', 'Abboud, Camille']","['Cashen AF', 'Fletcher T', 'Ceriotti C', 'Gao F', 'Ghobadi A', 'Vij R', 'Stockerl-Goldstein K', 'DiPersio J', 'Abboud C']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the MRD in AML for the first time with IDH1 and IDH2 gene mutations in 15 AML patients. METHODS: We have screened R132 IDH1, R140 IDH2 and R172 IDH2 mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing and we have quantified them for the first time by RQ-PCR using reverse primers modified by an LNA. A good sensitivity has been obtained. MRD rates obtained by LNA-RQ-PCR were used to draw kinetics of the disease evolution during the follow-up. RESULTS: IDH1/2 Results were compared to NPM1 mutation and WT1 over expression and have showed coherent kinetic between MRD rates in 7/11 cases. For the rest, the direct sequencing and the high resolution melting (HRM) assay have confirmed the quantification Results in diagnosis but not in residual samples. CONCLUSION: Some optimization will be necessary to improve the mutated allele amplification. The LNA-RQ-PCR might be an easy and less cost method used in a small laboratory for myeloid leukemia MRD assessment using IDH1/2 mutations.","['Abdelhamid, Emna', 'Besbes, Sawsen', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Helevaut, Nathalie', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Soua, Zohra']","['Abdelhamid E', 'Besbes S', 'Renneville A', 'Nibourel O', 'Helevaut N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Soua Z']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Tunisia,Tunis Med,La Tunisie medicale,0413766,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['/article-medicale-tunisie.php?article=3010 [pii]'],ppublish,Tunis Med. 2016 Mar;94(3):190-7.,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

However, the precise mechanism of clathrin assembly is not yet known. Clathrin assembly protein AP180 has more clathrin binding motifs than any other endocytic protein and has a major role in the assembly of the clathrin coat during synaptic vesicle biogenesis. We now demonstrate that some of the previously identified binding motifs in AP180 may be non-functional and that a non-conventional clathrin binding sequence has a major influence on AP180 function. The related protein, clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), has fewer clathrin binding motifs and functions ubiquitously in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The C-terminal ~16 kDa sub-domain in AP180, which has relatively high similarity with CALM, was shown in earlier work to have an unexplained role in clathrin binding. We identified the specific sequences in this sub-domain that bind to clathrin. Evidence for a role for these sequences in promoting clathrin binding was examined using in vitro and ex vivo experiments that compared the clathrin binding ability of site mutants with the wild type sequence. A sequence conserved in both AP180 and CALM (LDSSLA[S/N]LVGNLGI) was found to be the major interaction site and mutation caused a deficit in clathrin assembly, which is the first example of a mutation having this effect. In contrast, single or double mutation of DL(L/F) motifs in full length AP180 had no significant effect on clathrin binding, despite higher clathrin affinity for isolated peptides containing these motifs. We conclude that the novel clathrin interaction sites identified here in CALM and AP180 have a major role in how these proteins interface with clathrin. This work advances the case that AP180 and CALM are required to use a combination of standard clathrin N-terminal domain binding motifs and the sequence identified here for optimal binding and assembling clathrin.","['Moshkanbaryans, Lia', 'Xue, Jing', 'Wark, Jesse Ray', 'Robinson, Phillip James', 'Graham, Mark Evan']","['Moshkanbaryans L', 'Xue J', 'Wark JR', 'Robinson PJ', 'Graham ME']","[""Synapse Proteomics Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Synapse Proteomics Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia."", ""Synapse Proteomics Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160830,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation']",PMC5004861,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2016/08/31 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0162050 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-02456 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 30;11(8):e0162050. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0162050. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (PICALM protein, mouse)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7290-1217'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among type 1 inhibitors, pacritinib shows a lack of myelosuppression at doses that both inhibit JAK2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway and demonstrate clinical efficacy. To elucidate these mechanisms and identify other disease targets, a kinome analysis screened 439 recombinant kinases at 100 nM pacritinib concentration. For kinases with >50% inhibition, pacritinib was titrated from 1 to 100 nM. JAK2, JAK2V617F, FLT3, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 achieved half-maximal inhibitory concentrations <50 nM. Pacritinib did not inhibit JAK1 (82% control at 100 nM). Lack of myelosuppression may stem from inhibiting JAK2 without affecting JAK1 and reducing hematopoietic inhibitory cytokines by suppressing interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 or colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. The pacritinib kinome suggests therapeutic utility in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, solid tumors, and inflammatory conditions.","['Singer, Jack W', 'Al-Fayoumi, Suliman', 'Ma, Haiching', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Singer JW', 'Al-Fayoumi S', 'Ma H', 'Komrokji RS', 'Mesa R', 'Verstovsek S']","['Translational Medicine, CTI BioPharma Corp., Seattle, WA.', 'Translational Medicine, CTI BioPharma Corp., Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Research and Development, Reaction Biology, Malvern, PA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the novel polyethylene glycol (PEG)-poly L-lysine (PLL)-poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) based nanoparticles (NPs) modified by transferrin (Tf) loaded with daunorubicin (DNR) (DNR-Tf-PEG-PLL-PLGA-NPs, abbreviated as DNR-Tf-NPs) on leukemia cells (K562) under hypoxia. In vitro and in vivo tests to determine the effect of the enhanced chemosensitivity were evaluated using the immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, 3,-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-tetrazoliumbromide assay, Western blot analysis, histopathological examination, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Under hypoxia, K562 cells were hypoxia-responsive with the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of DNR increased, resulting in chemotherapy insensitivity. By targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR) on the surface of K562 cells, DNR-Tf-NPs led to an increased intracellular DNR level, enhancing drug sensitivity of K562 cells to DNR with a decreased IC50, even under hypoxia. We further detected the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 in K562 cells. The results indicated that DNR-Tf-NPs downregulated HIF-1alpha and induced apoptosis to overcome hypoxia. In the xenograft model, injection of DNR-Tf-NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth, and the immunosignals of Ki67 in DNR-Tf-NPs group was significantly lower than the other groups. It was therefore concluded that DNR-Tf-NPs could be a promising candidate for enhancing drug sensitivity under hypoxia in tumor treatment.","['Liu, Ping', 'Zhang, Haijun', 'Wu, Xue', 'Guo, Liting', 'Wang, Fei', 'Xia, Guohua', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Yin, HaiXiang', 'Wang, Yonglu', 'Li, Xueming']","['Liu P', 'Zhang H', 'Wu X', 'Guo L', 'Wang F', 'Xia G', 'Chen B', 'Yin H', 'Wang Y', 'Li X']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical School of Southeast University.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital.', ""School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,PMC4990384,,2016/08/31 06:00,2016/08/31 06:01,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S108169 [doi]', 'ott-9-5049 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 12;9:5049-59. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S108169. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PEG-PLL-PLGA nanoparticles', 'chemosensitivity', 'hypoxia', 'transferrin receptor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular strategies that selectively ""target"" delivery of corticosteroids minimize or prevents large amounts of the pharmaceutical moiety from passively diffusing into normal healthy cell populations residing within tissues and organ systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The covalent immunopharmaceutical, dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR] was synthesized by reacting dexamethasone-21-monophosphate with a carbodiimide reagent to form a dexamethasone phosphate carbodiimide ester that was subsequently reacted with imidazole to create an amine-reactive dexamethasone-(C21-phosphorylimidazolide) intermediate. Monoclonal anti-EGFR immunoglobulin was combined with the amine-reactive dexamethasone-(C21-phosphorylimidazolide) intermediate, resulting in the synthesis of the covalent immunopharmaceutical, dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR]. Following spectrophotometric analysis and validation of retained epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGFR)-binding avidity by cell-ELISA, the selective anti-neoplasic cytotoxic potency of dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR] was established by MTT-based vitality stain methodology using adherent monolayer populations of human pulmonary adenocarcinoma (A549) known to overexpress the tropic membrane receptors EGFR and insulin-like growth factor receptor type 1. RESULTS: The dexamethasone:IgG molar-incorporation-index for dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR] was 6.95:1 following exhaustive serial microfiltration. Cytotoxicity analysis: covalent bonding of dexamethasone to monoclonal anti-EGFR immunoglobulin did not significantly modify the ex vivo antineoplastic cytotoxicity of dexamethasone against pulmonary adenocarcinoma at and between the standardized dexamethasone equivalent concentrations of 10(-9) M and 10(-5) M. Rapid increases in antineoplastic cytotoxicity were observed at and between the dexamethasone equivalent concentrations of 10(-9) M and 10(-7) M where cancer cell death increased from 7.7% to a maximum of 64.9% (92.3%-35.1% residual survival), respectively, which closely paralleled values for ""free"" noncovalently bound dexamethasone. DISCUSSION: Organic chemistry reaction regimens were optimized to develop a multiphase synthesis regimen for dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR]. Attributes of dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-[anti-EGFR] include a high dexamethasone molar incorporation-index, lack of extraneous chemical group introduction, retained EGFR-binding avidity (""targeted"" delivery properties), and potential to enhance long-term pharmaceutical moiety effectiveness.","['Coyne, Cody P', 'Narayanan, Lakshmi']","['Coyne CP', 'Narayanan L']","['Department of Basic Sciences.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphoramides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4990379,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/04/04 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S102075 [doi]', 'dddt-10-2575 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2016 Aug 12;10:2575-97. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S102075. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoramides)', '0 (dexamethasone-(C21-phosphoramide)-(anti-EGFR))', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EGFR', 'anti-EGFR', 'covalent immunopharmaceuticals', 'dexamethasone', 'organic chemistry reactions', 'selective ""targeted"" delivery', 'synthesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prevailing assumption states that AML spatially displaces nonleukemic hematopoiesis from the bone marrow. However, examining an initial cohort of 223 AML patients, we found no correlation between bone marrow blast content and cytopenia, questioning the displacement theory. Measuring serum concentration of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes, revealed loss of physiologic negative correlation with platelet count in AML cases with blasts expressing MPL, the thrombopoietin (scavenging) receptor. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that MPL(hi) blasts could indeed clear TPO, likely therefore leading to insufficient cytokine levels for nonleukemic hematopoiesis. Microarray analysis in an independent multicenter study cohort of 437 AML cases validated MPL expression as a central predictor of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in AML. Moreover, t(8;21) AML cases demonstrated the highest average MPL expression and lowest average platelet and absolute neutrophil counts among subgroups. Our work thus explains the pathophysiology of peripheral blood cytopenia in a relevant number of AML cases.","['Rauch, Philipp J', 'Ellegast, Jana M', 'Widmer, Corinne C', 'Fritsch, Kristin', 'Goede, Jeroen S', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Takizawa, Hitoshi', 'Manz, Markus G']","['Rauch PJ', 'Ellegast JM', 'Widmer CC', 'Fritsch K', 'Goede JS', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Takizawa H', 'Manz MG']","['Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160829,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neutropenia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*biosynthesis', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Thrombopoietin/blood', 'Transcriptome']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34011-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-04-711986 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Nov 3;128(18):2253-2257. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-04-711986.

This study evaluated the expression of Foxp3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and investigated its role in epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were used for examining the expression of Foxp3 in NSCLC tissues and the non-tumor tissues. A tissue microarray was constructed and scored for evaluating the clinical significance of Foxp3 expression in NSCLC tissues. RNAi was employed for downregulating Foxp3 expression and cell proliferation was done with MTT assay. Transwell with or without basement membrane matrix was used for cell migration and invasion assay respectively. Foxp3 was found downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with non-tumoral tissues; downregulation of Foxp3 predicted adverse tumor stage and overall survival; silencing of FOXP3 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of NSCLC cells and influenced the expression level of EMT-associated proteins. However, forced expression of Foxp3 could reverse this effect. Moreover, Foxp3 could interact with LMO2 and affect the expression level of TAL1, which was in accordance with the findings in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By screening the signalling pathways, we observed an obvious upregulation of phosphorylated NF-kappaB in A549 and H520 cells after silencing of FOXP3. Our results suggest that Foxp3 suppressed NSCLC cell metastasis, at least partially, via NF-kappaB signaling.","['Wang, Xi', 'Liu, Ying', 'Dai, Lingling', 'Liu, Qi', 'Jia, Liuqun', 'Wang, Huan', 'An, Lin', 'Jing, Xiaogang', 'Liu, Meng', 'Li, Pengfei', 'Cheng, Zhe']","['Wang X', 'Liu Y', 'Dai L', 'Liu Q', 'Jia L', 'Wang H', 'An L', 'Jing X', 'Liu M', 'Li P', 'Cheng Z']","['Department of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, P.R.

The present study aims to identify disease-specific/disease-associated protein biomarkers detectable in bone marrow and peripheral blood for objective prediction of individual's best treatment options and prognostic monitoring of CML patients. Bone marrow plasma (BMP) and peripheral blood plasma (PBP) samples from newly-diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients were subjected to expression-proteomics using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analysis of 2-DE protein fingerprints preceding therapy commencement accurately predicts 13 individuals that achieved major molecular response (MMR) at 6 months from 12 subjects without MMR (No-MMR). Results were independently validated using LC-MS/MS analysis of BMP and PBP from patients that have more than 24 months followed-up. One hundred and sixty-four and 138 proteins with significant differential expression profiles were identified from PBP and BMP, respectively and only 54 proteins overlap between the two datasets. The protein panels also discriminates accurately patients that stay on imatinib treatment from patients ultimately needing alternative treatment. Among the identified proteins are TYRO3, a member of TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the S100A8, and MYC and all of which have been implicated in CML. Our findings indicate analyses of a panel of protein signatures is capable of objective prediction of molecular response and therapy choice for CML patients at diagnosis as 'personalized-medicine-model'.","['Alaiya, Ayodele A', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Shinwari, Zakia', 'Almohareb, Fahad', 'Malhan, Hafiz', 'Alzahrani, Hazzaa', 'Owaidah, Tarek', 'Fox, Jonathan', 'Alsharif, Fahad', 'Mohamed, Said Y', 'Rasheed, Walid', 'Aldawsari, Ghuzayel', 'Hanbali, Amr', 'Ahmed, Syed Osman', 'Chaudhri, Naeem']","['Alaiya AA', 'Aljurf M', 'Shinwari Z', 'Almohareb F', 'Malhan H', 'Alzahrani H', 'Owaidah T', 'Fox J', 'Alsharif F', 'Mohamed SY', 'Rasheed W', 'Aldawsari G', 'Hanbali A', 'Ahmed SO', 'Chaudhri N']","['Proteomics Unit, Stem Cell and Tissue Re-Engineering Program, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Proteomics Unit, Stem Cell and Tissue Re-Engineering Program, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Waters U.K. Limited, Atlas Park, Simonsway, Manchester, M22 5PP, UK.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT Section, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160707,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Calgranulin A/blood/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/blood/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/blood/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4948960,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/04/04 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2016.3618 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Sep;49(3):913-33. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3618.

Patients and Methods Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of 554 patients from two randomized trials of the German CLL Study Group (CLL8: fludarabine and cyclophosphamide [FC] v FC plus rituximab; CLL10: FC plus rituximab v bendamustine plus rituximab) were analyzed according to MRD assessed in peripheral blood at a threshold of 10(-4) and clinical response. The prognostic value of different parameters defining a partial response (PR) was further investigated. Results Patients with MRD-negative complete remission (CR), MRD-negative PR, MRD-positive CR, and MRD-positive PR experienced a median PFS from a landmark at end of treatment of 61 months, 54 months, 35 months, and 21 months, respectively. PFS did not differ significantly between MRD-negative CR and MRD-negative PR; however, PFS was longer for MRD-negative PR than for MRD-positive CR ( P = .048) and for MRD-positive CR compared with MRD-positive PR ( P = .002). Compared with MRD-negative CR, only patients with MRD-positive PR had a significantly shorter overall survival (not reached v 72 months; P = .001), whereas there was no detectable difference for patients with MRD-negative PR or MRD-positive CR ( P = 0.612 and P = 0.853, respectively). Patients with MRD-negative PR who presented with residual splenomegaly had only a similar PFS (63 months) compared with patients with MRD-negative CR (61 months; P = .354), whereas patients with MRD-negative PR with lymphadenopathy showed a shorter PFS (31 months; P < .001). Conclusion MRD quantification allows for improved PFS prediction in both patients who achive PR and CR, which thus supports its application in all responders. In contrast to residual lymphadenopathy, persisting splenomegaly does not impact outcome in patients with MRD-negative PR.","['Kovacs, Gabor', 'Robrecht, Sandra', 'Fink, Anna Maria', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Cramer, Paula', 'von Tresckow, Julia', 'Maurer, Christian', 'Langerbeins, Petra', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Bottcher, Sebastian']","['Kovacs G', 'Robrecht S', 'Fink AM', 'Bahlo J', 'Cramer P', 'von Tresckow J', 'Maurer C', 'Langerbeins P', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Ritgen M', 'Kneba M', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Klapper W', 'Wendtner CM', 'Fischer K', 'Hallek M', 'Eichhorst B', 'Bottcher S']","['Gabor Kovacs, Sandra Robrecht, Anna Maria Fink, Jasmin Bahlo, Paula Cramer, Julia von Tresckow, Christian Maurer, Petra Langerbeins, Kirsten Fischer, Michael Hallek, and Barbara Eichhorst, University of Cologne and Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne/Bonn, Cologne; Matthias Ritgen, Michael Kneba, and Sebastian Bottcher, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck; Hartmut Dohner and Stephan Stilgenbauer, University of Ulm, Ulm; Wolfram Klapper, University of Kiel, Kiel; Clemens-Martin Wendtner, Klinikum Schwabing, Munich, Germany; and Gunter Fingerle-Rowson, F.

Reported herein are results from a large study of patients with AML who were treated in consecutive ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group frontline clinical trials in an attempt to define the incidence and clinical implications of EMD. Methods Patients with newly diagnosed AML, age 15 years and older, who were treated in 11 clinical trials, were studied to identify EMD, as defined by physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging results. Results Of the 3,522 patients enrolled, 282 were excluded, including patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, incorrect diagnosis, or no adequate assessment of EMD at baseline. The overall incidence of EMD was 23.7%. The sites involved were: lymph nodes (11.5%), spleen (7.3%), liver (5.3%), skin (4.5%), gingiva (4.4%), and CNS (1.1%). Most patients (65.3%) had only one site of EMD, 20.9% had two sites, 9.5% had three sites, and 3.4% had four sites. The median overall survival was 1.035 years. In univariable analysis, the presence of any EMD ( P = .005), skin involvement ( P = .002), spleen ( P < .001), and liver ( P < .001), but not CNS ( P = .34), nodal involvement ( P = .94), and gingival hypertrophy ( P = .24), was associated with a shorter overall survival. In contrast, in multivariable analysis, adjusted for known prognostic factors such as cytogenetic risk and WBC count, neither the presence of EMD nor the number of specific sites of EMD were independently prognostic. Conclusion This large study demonstrates that EMD at any site is common but is not an independent prognostic factor. Treatment decisions for patients with EMD should be made on the basis of recognized AML prognostic factors, irrespective of the presence of EMD.","['Ganzel, Chezi', 'Manola, Judith', 'Douer, Dan', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Lee, Ju-Whei', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Cripe, Larry D', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Ganzel C', 'Manola J', 'Douer D', 'Rowe JM', 'Fernandez HF', 'Paietta EM', 'Litzow MR', 'Lee JW', 'Luger SM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Cripe LD', 'Wiernik PH', 'Tallman MS']","[""Chezi Genzel and Jacob M.

The pNSCs are upstream of the dNSCs in the neural stem cell lineage. Herein we show that pNSC and dNSC populations can also be isolated from the developing and adult spinal cord. Spinal cord derived pNSCs are similarly rare, Oct4 expressing cells that are responsive to leukemia inhibitory factor and dNSCs are 4-5X more abundant and express GFAP. We demonstrate that myelin basic protein (MBP) is inhibitory to both pNSC and dNSC derived colony formation. Similar to what is seen in the adult forebrain following injury, spinal cord injury results in a significant increase in the size of the dNSC and pNSC pools. Hence, both primitive and definitive neural stem cells can be isolated from along the embryonic and adult neuraxis in vivo and their behavior is regulated by MBP and injury.

The Food and Drug Administration-approved immunosuppressant FTY720 limits leukemia progression by activating protein phosphatase 2A and restricting nutrient access. Unfortunately, FTY720 cannot be re-purposed for use in cancer patients due to on-target toxicity associated with S1P receptor activation at the elevated, anti-neoplastic dose. Here we show that the constrained azacyclic FTY720 analog SH-RF-177 lacks S1P receptor activity but maintains anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo. SH-RF-177 was not only more potent than FTY720, but killed via a distinct mechanism. Phosphorylation is dispensable for FTY720's anti-leukemic actions. However, chemical biology and genetic approaches demonstrated that the sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2)-mediated phosphorylation of SH-RF-177 led to engagement of a pro-apoptotic target and increased potency. The cytotoxicity of membrane-permeant FTY720 phosphonate esters suggests that the enhanced potency of SH-RF-177 stems from its more efficient phosphorylation. The tight inverse correlation between SH-RF-177 IC50 and SPHK2 mRNA expression suggests a useful biomarker for SH-RF-177 sensitivity. In summary, these studies indicate that FTY720 analogs that are efficiently phosphorylated but fail to activate S1P receptors may be superior anti-leukemic agents compared to compounds that avoid cardiotoxicity by eliminating phosphorylation.","['McCracken, A N', 'McMonigle, R J', 'Tessier, J', 'Fransson, R', 'Perryman, M S', 'Chen, B', 'Keebaugh, A', 'Selwan, E', 'Barr, S A', 'Kim, S M', 'Roy, S G', 'Liu, G', 'Fallegger, D', 'Sernissi, L', 'Brandt, C', 'Moitessier, N', 'Snider, A J', 'Clare, S', 'Muschen, M', 'Huwiler, A', 'Kleinman, M T', 'Hanessian, S', 'Edinger, A L']","['McCracken AN', 'McMonigle RJ', 'Tessier J', 'Fransson R', 'Perryman MS', 'Chen B', 'Keebaugh A', 'Selwan E', 'Barr SA', 'Kim SM', 'Roy SG', 'Liu G', 'Fallegger D', 'Sernissi L', 'Brandt C', 'Moitessier N', 'Snider AJ', 'Clare S', 'Muschen M', 'Huwiler A', 'Kleinman MT', 'Hanessian S', 'Edinger AL']","['Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Wellcome Trust Sanger Genome Campus, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, NY, USA.', 'The Wellcome Trust Sanger Genome Campus, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160830,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/agonists/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5332311,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016244 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.244 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):669-677. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.244.

Pharmacological targeting of BRD4 bromodomains by small molecule inhibitors has proven to be an effective means to disrupt aberrant transcriptional programs critical for tumor growth and/or survival. Herein, we report AZD5153, a potent, selective, and orally available BET/BRD4 bromodomain inhibitor possessing a bivalent binding mode. Unlike previously described monovalent inhibitors, AZD5153 ligates two bromodomains in BRD4 simultaneously. The enhanced avidity afforded through bivalent binding translates into increased cellular and antitumor activity in preclinical hematologic tumor models. In vivo administration of AZD5153 led to tumor stasis or regression in multiple xenograft models of acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The relationship between AZD5153 exposure and efficacy suggests that prolonged BRD4 target coverage is a primary efficacy driver. AZD5153 treatment markedly affects transcriptional programs of MYC, E2F, and mTOR. Of note, mTOR pathway modulation is associated with cell line sensitivity to AZD5153. Transcriptional modulation of MYC and HEXIM1 was confirmed in AZD5153-treated human whole blood, thus supporting their use as clinical pharmacodynamic biomarkers. This study establishes AZD5153 as a highly potent, orally available BET/BRD4 inhibitor and provides a rationale for clinical development in hematologic malignancies. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(11); 2563-74.

Rather, drug combinations are largely dictated by empirical or clinical parameters. In the present study we developed a strategy for rational design of a regimen that selectively targets human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) stem cells. As a starting point, we used parthenolide, an agent shown to target critical mechanisms of redox balance in primary AML cells. Next, using proteomic, genomic, and metabolomic methods, we determined that treatment with parthenolide leads to induction of compensatory mechanisms that include up-regulated NADPH production via the pentose phosphate pathway as well as activation of the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway. Using this knowledge we identified 2-deoxyglucose and temsirolimus as agents that can be added to a parthenolide regimen as a means to inhibit such compensatory events and thereby further enhance eradication of AML cells. We demonstrate that the parthenolide, 2-deoxyglucose, temsirolimus (termed PDT) regimen is a potent means of targeting AML stem cells but has little to no effect on normal stem cells. Taken together our findings illustrate a comprehensive approach to designing combination anticancer drug regimens.","['Pei, Shanshan', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Nemkov, Travis', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Adane, Biniam', 'Khan, Nabilah', 'Hagen, Fred K', 'Yadav, Vinod K', 'De, Subhajyoti', 'Ashton, John M', 'Hansen, Kirk C', 'Gutman, Jonathan A', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Crooks, Peter A', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Pei S', 'Minhajuddin M', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Nemkov T', 'Stevens BM', 'Adane B', 'Khan N', 'Hagen FK', 'Yadav VK', 'De S', 'Ashton JM', 'Hansen KC', 'Gutman JA', 'Pollyea DA', 'Crooks PA', 'Smith C', 'Jordan CT']","['From the Division of Hematology and.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205.', 'From the Division of Hematology and.', 'From the Division of Hematology and craig.jordan@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'NADP/biosynthesis', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC5063982,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35782-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.750653 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Oct 14;291(42):21984-22000. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.750653.

HS commonly presents after puberty, with most patients diagnosed in the second decade of their life. Several studies have investigated smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia as possible underlying risk factors for HS. However, we encountered 2 patients with a long-standing history of untreated leukemia who developed late-onset HS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of malignancy as an underlying risk factor for development of HS. METHOD: The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for keywords such as hidradenitis suppurativa, malignancy, cancer, and epidemiology. OBSERVATION: Only 1 retrospective Swedish study with 2119 patients investigated the prevalence of cancer, including 6 hematopoietic malignancies, in HS patients. However, the study did not assess the timeline of developing HS in relation to the cancer diagnosis. We report 2 patients with a long-standing history of hematopoietic cancers who received no continuous treatments for their malignancies and developed late-onset HS: a 60-year-old male patient with hairy cell leukemia and a 68-year-old male patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed HS later in life. CONCLUSION: Multiple epidemiologic studies found the average age of HS diagnosis to be well prior to the fourth decade of life. The latency of the HS diagnosis as well as the presence of long-standing leukemia in both of our patients raises the necessity for assessing the possibility of malignancy, especially hematopoietic cancer, as a risk factor for HS. LIMITATION: This is a small retrospective analysis including only 2 patients. Larger studies would better assess the role of malignancy, leukemia in particular, as a possible risk factor for development of HS.","['Sotoodian, Bahman', 'Abbas, Mariam', 'Brassard, Alain']","['Sotoodian B', 'Abbas M', 'Brassard A']","['1 Division of Dermatology and Cutaneous Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', '1 Division of Dermatology and Cutaneous Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', '1 Division of Dermatology and Cutaneous Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160922,United States,J Cutan Med Surg,Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,9614685,IM,"['Adalimumab/therapeutic use', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/10/19 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1203475416668161 [pii]', '10.1177/1203475416668161 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Med Surg. 2017 Mar/Apr;21(2):158-161. doi: 10.1177/1203475416668161.

This experience demonstrates that the most important goal in such cases is to alleviate a patient's discomfort by applying minimally invasive actions to eliminate infection and improve the quality of life without causing deterioration in the CMMoL status.","['Kojima, Yuki', 'Ishigami, Takashi', 'Akiba, Masakazu']","['Kojima Y', 'Ishigami T', 'Akiba M']","['Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Asahi General Hospital, I 1326, Asahi City, Chiba 289-2511, Japan Department of Physiology, Tokyo Dental College, 2-9-18 Misaki-cho, Tokyo 101-0061, Japan yukikojima@tdc.ac.jp.', 'Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Asahi General Hospital, I 1326, Asahi City, Chiba 289-2511, Japan.', 'Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Asahi General Hospital, I 1326, Asahi City, Chiba 289-2511, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160829,England,J Surg Case Rep,Journal of surgical case reports,101560169,,,PMC5002941,,2016/08/31 06:00,2016/08/31 06:01,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:01 [medline]']","['rjw149 [pii]', '10.1093/jscr/rjw149 [doi]']",epublish,J Surg Case Rep. 2016 Aug 29;2016(8). pii: rjw149. doi: 10.1093/jscr/rjw149.,,,,,"['Published by Oxford University Press and JSCR Publishing Ltd.

These cases are assumed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have stable multipotent differentiation potential. However, here we report that plasticity in leukemia can result from instable lineage identity states inherited from differentiating progenitor cells. Using mice with enhanced c-Myc expression, we show, at the single-cell level, that T-lymphoid progenitors retain broad malignant lineage potential with a high capacity to differentiate into myeloid leukemia. These T-cell-derived myeloid blasts retain expression of a defined set of T-cell transcription factors, creating a lymphoid epigenetic memory that confers growth and propagates myeloid/T-lymphoid plasticity. Based on these characteristics, we identified a correlating human leukemia cohort and revealed targeting of Jak2/Stat3 signaling as a therapeutic possibility. Collectively, our study suggests the thymus as a source for myeloid leukemia and proposes leukemic plasticity as a driving mechanism. Moreover, our results reveal a pathway-directed therapy option against thymus-derived myeloid leukemogenesis and propose a model in which dynamic progenitor differentiation states shape unique neoplastic identities and therapy responses.","['Riemke, Pia', 'Czeh, Melinda', 'Fischer, Josephine', 'Walter, Carolin', 'Ghani, Saeed', 'Zepper, Matthias', 'Agelopoulos, Konstantin', 'Lettermann, Stephanie', 'Gebhardt, Marie L', 'Mah, Nancy', 'Weilemann, Andre', 'Grau, Michael', 'Groning, Verena', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Lenze, Dido', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Prinz, Marco', 'Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Rosenbauer, Frank']","['Riemke P', 'Czeh M', 'Fischer J', 'Walter C', 'Ghani S', 'Zepper M', 'Agelopoulos K', 'Lettermann S', 'Gebhardt ML', 'Mah N', 'Weilemann A', 'Grau M', 'Groning V', 'Haferlach T', 'Lenze D', 'Delwel R', 'Prinz M', 'Andrade-Navarro MA', 'Lenz G', 'Dugas M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Rosenbauer F']","['Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Clinic, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Competence Center Chronic Pruritus University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Medical Clinics A, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Data Mining, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin-Brandenburger Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, Medical Clinics A, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Munster, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, Medical Clinics A, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Informatics and Biomathematics, Institute of Molecular Biology Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, Medical Clinics A, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany frank.rosenbauer@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160829,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",PMC5109237,,2016/08/31 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/08/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['embj.201693927 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201693927 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2016 Nov 15;35(22):2399-2416. doi: 10.15252/embj.201693927.

However, the role of S1PR1 in the progression of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the correlation between the expression level of S1PR1 and the growth and apoptosis of human AML cells was investigated. Using overexpression and RNA interference knockdown assays, it was shown that the expression of S1PR1 in several human myeloid leukemia cell lines contributed to the suppression of cell apoptosis and promotion of cell proliferation. S1PR1 inhibited the expression level of B cell lymphoma2associated X protein, a mitochondrionassociated apoptosis promoter, and prevented caspase3 cleavage, indicating that S1PR1 interfered with the mitochondrionassociated apoptotic processes in AML cells. In addition, the present study demonstrated that S1PR1 suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AML cells, and that the apoptosis mediated by the downregulation of S1PR1 was partially reversed by treatment with NacetylLcysteine, a ROS scavenging agent, suggesting that the S1PR1induced resistance of cell apoptosis resulted, at least partially, from the suppression of ROS generation. Additionally, S1PR1 was able to interfere with the signaling of cJun Nterminal kinase, which may have also contribute dto the suppression of cell apoptosis. By contrast, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) signaling appeared to be positively modulated by the S1PR1induced enhancement of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1 (MKK1) activation, suggesting that S1PR1 may promote cell survival and proliferation through enhancing the activation of MKK1ERK signaling. In conclusion, S1PR1 likely serves as an antiapoptotic/proproliferative protein in AML cells through the inhibition of mitochondrionassociated apoptosis and ROS generation, and via the regulation of multiple MAPK signaling cascades.","['Xu, Xiao-Qian', 'Huang, Chong-Mei', 'Zhang, Yi-Fan', 'Chen, Li', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Wang, Jian-Min']","['Xu XQ', 'Huang CM', 'Zhang YF', 'Chen L', 'Cheng H', 'Wang JM']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, P.R.

METHODS: A 75-year-old black man presented with acute decreased vision in both eyes for 1 week. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (Investigational Device; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc) were performed. RESULTS: Clinical examination of the patient revealed anterior and posterior inflammation and bilateral serous retinal detachments. Ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence secondary to subretinal fluid; and fluorescein angiography revealed multiple areas of punctate hyperfluorescence, leakage, and staining of the optic discs. Spectral domain and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography demonstrated subretinal fluid, a thickened, undulating retinal pigment epithelium layer, and a thickened choroid in both eyes. En-face swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography did not show any retinal vascular abnormalities but did demonstrate patchy areas of decreased choriocapillaris flow. An extensive systemic infectious and malignancy workup was negative and the patient was treated with high-dose oral prednisone immunosuppression. Subsequent 6-month follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of the inflammation and bilateral serous detachments after completion of the prednisone taper over a 3-month period. CONCLUSION: Graft-versus-host disease panuveitis and bilateral serous retinal detachments are rare complications of allogenic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukemia and can be diagnosed with clinical and multimodal imaging analysis. This form of autoimmune inflammation may occur after the recovery of T-cell activity within the donor graft targeting the host. Infectious and recurrent malignancy must be ruled out before initiation of immunosuppression, which can affectively treat this form of graft-versus-host disease.","['Jung, Jesse J', 'Chen, Michael H', 'Rofagha, Soraya', 'Lee, Scott S']","['Jung JJ', 'Chen MH', 'Rofagha S', 'Lee SS']","['*East Bay Retina Consultants Inc, Oakland, California; daggerSilicon Valley Eyecare, Santa Clara, California; and double daggerDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Central Serous Chorioretinopathy/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Panuveitis/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Retinal Detachment/diagnosis/*etiology']",,,2016/08/30 06:00,2017/04/26 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/ICB.0000000000000404 [doi]'],ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2017 Winter;11 Suppl 1:S54-S61. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CD19-negative relapses have emerged as a major problem that is observed in approximately 30% of treated patients. Developing approaches to preventing and treating antigen-loss escapes would therefore represent a vertical advance in the field. Here, we found that in primary patient samples, the IL-3 receptor alpha chain CD123 was highly expressed on leukemia-initiating cells and CD19-negative blasts in bulk B-ALL at baseline and at relapse after CART19 administration. Using intravital imaging in an antigen-loss CD19-negative relapse xenograft model, we determined that CART123, but not CART19, recognized leukemic blasts, established protracted synapses, and eradicated CD19-negative leukemia, leading to prolonged survival. Furthermore, combining CART19 and CART123 prevented antigen-loss relapses in xenograft models. Finally, we devised a dual CAR-expressing construct that combined CD19- and CD123-mediated T cell activation and demonstrated that it provides superior in vivo activity against B-ALL compared with single-expressing CART or pooled combination CART. In conclusion, these findings indicate that targeting CD19 and CD123 on leukemic blasts represents an effective strategy for treating and preventing antigen-loss relapses occurring after CD19-directed therapies.","['Ruella, Marco', 'Barrett, David M', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Hofmann, Ted J', 'Perazzelli, Jessica', 'Klichinsky, Michael', 'Aikawa, Vania', 'Nazimuddin, Farzana', 'Kozlowski, Miroslaw', 'Scholler, John', 'Lacey, Simon F', 'Melenhorst, Jan J', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Christian, David A', 'Hunter, Christopher A', 'Kalos, Michael', 'Porter, David L', 'June, Carl H', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Gill, Saar']","['Ruella M', 'Barrett DM', 'Kenderian SS', 'Shestova O', 'Hofmann TJ', 'Perazzelli J', 'Klichinsky M', 'Aikawa V', 'Nazimuddin F', 'Kozlowski M', 'Scholler J', 'Lacey SF', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Morrissette JJ', 'Christian DA', 'Hunter CA', 'Kalos M', 'Porter DL', 'June CH', 'Grupp SA', 'Gill S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160829,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5096828,,2016/08/30 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['87366 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI87366 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Oct 3;126(10):3814-3826. doi: 10.1172/JCI87366.

Evaluating a published rhesus macaque periovulatory transcriptome database revealed that mRNA encoding leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its downstream signaling effectors are up-regulated in the follicle after animals receive an ovulatory stimulus (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]). Follicular LIF mRNA and protein levels are below the limit of detection before the administration of hCG but increase significantly 12 hours thereafter. Downstream LIF receptor (LIFR) signaling components including IL-6 signal transducer, the receptor associated Janus kinase 1, and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 also exhibit increased expression in the rhesus macaque follicle 12 hours after administration of an ovulatory hCG bolus. A laparoscopic ovarian evaluation 72 hours after the injection of a LIF antagonist (soluble LIFR) into the rhesus macaque preovulatory follicle and hCG administration revealed blocking LIF action prevented ovulation (typically occurs 36-44 h after hCG). Moreover, ovaries removed 52 hours after both hCG and intrafollicular soluble LIFR administration confirmed ovulation was blocked as evidenced by the presence of an intact follicle and a trapped cumulus-oocyte complex. These findings give new insight into the role of LIF in the primate ovary and could lead to the development of new approaches for the control of fertility.","['Murphy, Melinda J', 'Halow, Nathan G', 'Royer, Pamela A', 'Hennebold, Jon D']","['Murphy MJ', 'Halow NG', 'Royer PA', 'Hennebold JD']","['Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences (M.J.M., N.G.H., P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon 97006; and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239.', 'Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences (M.J.M., N.G.H., P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon 97006; and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239.', 'Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences (M.J.M., N.G.H., P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon 97006; and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239.', 'Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences (M.J.M., N.G.H., P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon 97006; and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (P.A.R., J.D.H.), Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology', 'Cumulus Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Oocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Ovarian Follicle/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Ovulation/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",PMC5086537,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2016-1283 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2016 Nov;157(11):4378-4387. doi: 10.1210/en.2016-1283.

All had been treated using protocols of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Childhood ALL Consortium. The median age was 21.15 years and time from diagnosis 15.07 years, and 27 subjects had experienced fractures. More than 30% of the total sample were OW/OB. There was no correlation of body mass index with present PA. There were no significant differences between those with/without fractures in terms of age, sex, time from diagnosis, and the prevalence of OW/OB. Subjects with fractures during treatment reported more total activity on typical weekend days than those without fractures (mean 8.8 vs. 6.9 h, P<0.01).

However, acquired resistance has emerged, and second generation therapies are now being sought. Ibrutinib is a covalent, irreversible inhibitor that modifies Cys481 in the ATP binding site of Btk and renders the enzyme inactive, thereby blocking B-cell receptor signal transduction. Not surprisingly, Cys481 is the most commonly mutated Btk residue in cases of acquired resistance to ibrutinib. Mutations at other sites, including Thr474, a gatekeeper residue, have also been detected. Herein, we describe noncovalent Btk inhibitors that differ from covalent inhibitors like ibrutinib in that they do not interact with Cys481, they potently inhibit the ibrutinib-resistant Btk C481S mutant in vitro and in cells, and they are exquisitely selective for Btk. Noncovalent inhibitors such as GNE-431 also show excellent potency against the C481R, T474I, and T474M mutants. X-ray crystallographic analysis of Btk provides insight into the unique mode of binding of these inhibitors that explains their high selectivity for Btk and their retained activity against mutant forms of Btk. This class of noncovalent Btk inhibitors may provide a treatment option to patients, especially those who have acquired resistance to ibrutinib by mutation of Cys481 or Thr474.","['Johnson, Adam R', 'Kohli, Pawan Bir', 'Katewa, Arna', 'Gogol, Emily', 'Belmont, Lisa D', 'Choy, Regina', 'Penuel, Elicia', 'Burton, Luciana', 'Eigenbrot, Charles', 'Yu, Christine', 'Ortwine, Daniel F', 'Bowman, Krista', 'Franke, Yvonne', 'Tam, Christine', 'Estevez, Alberto', 'Mortara, Kyle', 'Wu, Jiansheng', 'Li, Hong', 'Lin, May', 'Bergeron, Philippe', 'Crawford, James J', 'Young, Wendy B']","['Johnson AR', 'Kohli PB', 'Katewa A', 'Gogol E', 'Belmont LD', 'Choy R', 'Penuel E', 'Burton L', 'Eigenbrot C', 'Yu C', 'Ortwine DF', 'Bowman K', 'Franke Y', 'Tam C', 'Estevez A', 'Mortara K', 'Wu J', 'Li H', 'Lin M', 'Bergeron P', 'Crawford JJ', 'Young WB']","['Biochemical and Cellular Pharmacology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Biochemical and Cellular Pharmacology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Immunology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Immunology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Oncology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Oncology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Biomarker Development, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Biomarker Development, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Computational Chemistry, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Chemistry, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Chemistry, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.', 'Discovery Chemistry, Genentech , 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160907,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cysteine/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', '*Mutation', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Threonine/*genetics']",,,2016/10/22 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.6b00480 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2016 Oct 21;11(10):2897-2907. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.6b00480.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 61 episodes of GNB bacteremia occurring in 56 patients with malignancy admitted to the Oncology Units in King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period from January 2013 to October 2015. Data were retrieved from the computerized database of the microbiology laboratory and the patient's medical records. RESULTS: Hematological malignancies accounted for 30 (54%) and solid tumors accounted for 26 (46%). The most common hematological malignancies were leukemia 23 (77%), followed by lymphoma 6 (20%). Among solid tumors, colorectal cancer 9 (34.6) and breast cancer 6 (23%) were the most common. The most predominant pathogen was Escherichia coli (E. coli) (29.5%) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) (18%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers rate of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia was (34.6%). Imipenem resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa/ A. baumannii was high (52.4%). The multi-resistant organisms rate was (43.5%). Risk factors associated with the bacteremia were ICU admission (32.1%), post-surgery (23.2%), and placement of central line (21.4%). The overall 30-day mortality rate of the studied population was high (32.1%). CONCLUSION: In light of the high resistant rate among the GNB isolated from malignancy patients from our institution, careful selection of antimicrobial treatment based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended.","['Al-Otaibi, Fawzia E', 'Bukhari, Elham E', 'Badr, Mona', 'Alrabiaa, Abdulkarim A']","['Al-Otaibi FE', 'Bukhari EE', 'Badr M', 'Alrabiaa AA']","['Department of Microbiology, King Saud University, King Khalid Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Loss of MMR leads to replication dependent mutational events and microsatellite instability observed in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. Epigenetic CpG methylation upstream of the MLH1 promoter is a contributing factor to acquired loss of MLH1 expression in tumors of the epithelia and proximal mucosa. Using single molecule high-throughput bisulfite sequencing we have characterized the CpG methylation landscape from -938 to -337 bp upstream of the MLH1 transcriptional start site (position +0), from 30 hematopoietic colony forming cell clones (CFC) either expressing or not expressing MLH1. We identify a correlation between MLH1 promoter methylation and loss of MLH1 expression. Additionally, using the CpG site methylation frequencies obtained in this study we were able to generate a classification algorithm capable of sorting the expressing and non-expressing CFC. Thus, as has been previously described for many tumor cell types, we report for the first time a correlation between the loss of MLH1 expression and increased MLH1 promoter methylation in CFC derived from CD34(+) selected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","['Kenyon, Jonathan', 'Nickel-Meester, Gabrielle', 'Qing, Yulan', 'Santos-Guasch, Gabriela', 'Drake, Ellen', 'PingfuFu', 'Sun, Shuying', 'Bai, Xiaodong', 'Wald, David', 'Arts, Eric', 'Gerson, Stanton L']","['Kenyon J', 'Nickel-Meester G', 'Qing Y', 'Santos-Guasch G', 'Drake E', 'PingfuFu', 'Sun S', 'Bai X', 'Wald D', 'Arts E', 'Gerson SL']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Case School of Medicine and the Center for AIDS Research, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Department of Mathematics, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, 78666, USA.', 'RNA Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Case School of Medicine and the Center for AIDS Research, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA; Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160524,United States,Int J Stem Cell Res Ther,International journal of stem cell research and therapy,101682963,,,PMC4996274,,2016/08/30 06:00,2016/08/30 06:01,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.23937/2469-570x/1410031 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Stem Cell Res Ther. 2016;3(2). doi: 10.23937/2469-570x/1410031.

However, detailed knowledge of the initial molecular events in the response of cancer cells to these chemotherapeutic and stress responses, and how these lead to the development of chemoresistance, remains incompletely understood. Using microRNA array and washout and rechallenge experiments, we found that short term treatment of leukemia cells with etoposide led a few days later to transient resistance that was associated with a corresponding transient increase in expression of ABCB1 mRNA, as well as microRNA (miR)-135b and miR-196b. This phenomenon was associated with short-term exposure to genotoxic agents, such as etoposide, topotecan, doxorubicin and ionizing radiation, but not agents that do not directly damage DNA. Further, this appeared to be histiotype-specific, and was seen in leukemic cells, but not in cell lines derived from solid tumors. Treatment of leukemic cells with either 5-aza-deoxycytidine or tricostatin A produced similar increased expression of ABCB1, miR-135b, and miR-196b, suggesting a role for epigenetic regulation of this phenomenon. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that CACNA1E, ARHGEF2, PTK2, SIAH1, ARHGAP6, and NME4 may be involved in the initial events in the development of drug resistance following the upregulation of ABCB1, miR-135b and miR-196b. In summary, we report herein that short-term exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents leads to transient drug resistance, which is associated with elevations in ABCB1, miR-135b and miR-196b, and suggests novel components that may be involved in the development of anticancer drug resistance.","['Ho, Tsui-Ting', 'He, Xiaolong', 'Mo, Yin-Yuan', 'Beck, William T']","['Ho TT', 'He X', 'Mo YY', 'Beck WT']","['Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at ChicagoChicago 60612, IL, USA; Cancer Institute, University of Mississippi Medical CenterJackson, 39216, MS, USA; Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Mississippi Medical CenterJackson, 39216, MS, USA.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at ChicagoChicago 60612, IL, USA; Cancer Center, University of Illinois at ChicagoChicago 60612, IL, USA.', 'Cancer Institute, University of Mississippi Medical CenterJackson, 39216, MS, USA; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical CenterJackson, 39216, MS, USA.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at ChicagoChicago 60612, IL, USA; Cancer Center, University of Illinois at ChicagoChicago 60612, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160805,United States,Int J Biochem Mol Biol,International journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,101532076,,,PMC4981649,,2016/08/30 06:00,2016/08/30 06:01,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Biochem Mol Biol. 2016 Aug 5;7(2):27-47. eCollection 2016.,"['C06 RR015482/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA040570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Genotoxic agents', 'miR-135b', 'miR-196b', 'microRNAs', 'transient anticancer drug resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocations resulting in the ETV6-ABL1 fusion gene are rare in AML and other hematologic malignancies with only thirty-two previously reported cases in the literature, five of which were AML. FINDINGS: Herein, we report the case of a 73-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia arising from MDS, negative for PDGFRA and PDGFRB, positive for bone marrow eosinophilia, rash, and marked fluid retention, which improved dramatically with imatinib therapy. Conventional cytogenetics revealed a t(3;9)(p25;q34), t(5;18)(q13;p11.2), and additional material of unknown origin at 12p11.2 in 2 out of 10 metaphases analyzed. Interphase FISH studies showed evidence of ETV6 (12p13) and ABL1 (9q34) rearrangements in 41.3 % and 5.7 % of the cells respectively. FISH studies on previously G-banded metaphases showed colocalization of ABL1 and ETV6 signals to the short arm of chromosome 3 at 3p25 suggesting a possible ETV6-ABL1 fusion. Subtelomeric metaphase FISH studies also showed the presence of a subtelomere 3p signal on the long arm of the derivative 9, and no subtelomere 3p signal on the derivative chromosome 12. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a complex rearrangement involving an insertion of ETV6 into 3p25 followed by a reciprocal translocation involving 3p25 and 9q34, resulting in a possible ETV6-ABL1 fusion. This case highlights the importance of FISH to characterize complex rearrangements in myeloid malignancies, particularly those resulting in clinically significant chimeric genes.","['Tirado, Carlos A', 'Siangchin, Ken', 'Shabsovich, David S', 'Sharifian, Maryam', 'Schiller, Gary']","['Tirado CA', 'Siangchin K', 'Shabsovich DS', 'Sharifian M', 'Schiller G']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, West Medical Building, 1010 Veteran Ave, Second Floor room 2212F, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.', 'Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160825,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,PMC5000511,,2016/08/30 06:00,2016/08/30 06:01,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-016-0070-7 [doi]', '70 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2016 Aug 25;4(1):16. doi: 10.1186/s40364-016-0070-7. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Cytogenetics', 'ETV6-ABL1', 'FISH', 'Imatinib', 'MDS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying proteins to regulate survival and stemness of LSCs is urgently needed. Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can eliminate quiescent LSCs in CML, little is known about the underlying mechanism that HDACis kill LSCs. By fishing with a biotin-labeled probe, we identified that HDACi JSL-1 bound to the protein gamma-catenin. gamma-Catenin expression was higher in LSCs from CML patients than normal hematopoietic stem cells. Silencing gamma-catenin in human CML CD34(+) bone-marrow (BM) cells sufficiently eliminated LSCs, which suggests that gamma-catenin is required for survival of CML LSCs. Pharmacological inhibition of gamma-catenin thwarted survival and self-renewal of human CML CD34(+) cells in vitro, and of murine LSCs in BCR-ABL-driven CML mice. gamma-Catenin inhibition reduced long-term engraftment of human CML CD34(+) cells in NOD.Cg-Prkdc (scid) II2rg (tm1Sug)/JicCrl (NOG) mice. Silencing gamma-catenin by shRNA in human primary CD34(+) cells did not alter beta-catenin, implying a beta-catenin-independent role of gamma-catenin in survival and self-renewal of CML LSCs. Taken together, our findings validate that gamma-catenin may be a novel therapeutic target of LSCs, and suppression of gamma-catenin by HDACi may explain elimination of CML LSCs.","['Jin, Yanli', 'Yao, Yiwu', 'Chen, Li', 'Zhu, Xiaohui', 'Jin, Bei', 'Shen, Yingying', 'Li, Juan', 'Du, Xin', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Jiang, Sheng', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Jin Y', 'Yao Y', 'Chen L', 'Zhu X', 'Jin B', 'Shen Y', 'Li J', 'Du X', 'Lu Y', 'Jiang S', 'Pan J']","['Jinan University Institute of Tumor Pharmacology, Jinan University College of Pharmacy; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Jinan University Institute of Tumor Pharmacology, Jinan University College of Pharmacy; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital/Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China;', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China;', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China;', 'Jinan University Institute of Tumor Pharmacology, Jinan University College of Pharmacy; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China;; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160812,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Desmoplakins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Heterografts', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma Catenin']",PMC4997248,['Authors have no conflicts of interest.'],2016/08/30 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.16139 [doi]', 'thnov06p1947 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2016 Aug 12;6(11):1947-62. doi: 10.7150/thno.16139. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Desmoplakins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (JUP protein, human)', '0 (gamma Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL.', '*HDAC inhibitor', '*imatinib-resistance', '*leukemia stem cells', '*gamma-catenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL fusion, caused by the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) through translocation, constitutes the disease-initiating event in chronic myeloid leukemia. The development of successive BCR-ABL-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors has led to greatly improved outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, including high rates of complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses. Such levels of treatment success have long been elusive for patients with Ph-negative MPNs, because of the difficulties in identifying specific driver proteins suitable as drug targets. However, in recent years an improved understanding of the complex pathobiology of classic Ph-negative MPNs, characterized by variable, overlapping multimutation profiles, has prompted the development of better and more broadly targeted (to pathway rather than protein) treatment options, particularly JAK inhibitors. In classic Ph-negative MPNs, overactivation of JAK-dependent signaling pathways is a central pathogenic mechanism, and mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR linked to aberrant JAK activation are now recognized as key drivers of disease progression in myelofibrosis (MF). In clinical trials, the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib - the first therapy approved for MF worldwide - improved disease-related splenomegaly and symptoms independent of JAK2 (V617F) mutational status, and prolonged survival compared with placebo or standard therapy in patients with advanced MF. In separate trials, ruxolitinib also provided comprehensive hematologic control in patients with another Ph-negative MPN - polycythemia vera. However, complete cytogenetic or molecular responses with JAK inhibitors alone are normally not observed, underscoring the need for novel combination therapies of JAK inhibitors and complementary agents that better address the complexity of the pathobiology of classic Ph-negative MPNs. Here, we discuss the role of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in the current MPN-treatment landscape.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Sweet, Kendra L', 'Corrales-Yepez, Gabriela M', 'Komrokji, Rami S']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Sweet KL', 'Corrales-Yepez GM', 'Komrokji RS']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160810,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,PMC4986686,,2016/08/30 06:00,2016/08/30 06:01,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S102504 [doi]', 'ott-9-4937 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 10;9:4937-57. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S102504. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK inhibitor', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'myelofibrosis', 'ruxolitinib', 'tyrosine-kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ofatumumab is a human type I anti-CD20 antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are in complete or partial response after at least two lines of treatment; higher efficacy might be observed if used as consolidation strategy than without consolidation in previously untreated patients. METHODS: We recruited patients with previously untreated progressive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and adequate renal and hepatic function from centres in the USA. Patients with recent myocardial infarction; class III or IV heart failure; uncontrolled, HIV, or active hepatitis B or C infection; or active haemolytic anaemia were excluded. In the first arm of this study, which has been previously reported, patients were treated with six cycles of induction with pentostatin (2 mg/m(2) on day 1), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2) on day 1), and ofatumumab (cycle 1: 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg/m(2) on day 2; cycles 2-6: 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1) given intravenously every 21 days. Here were report the second arm, where patients received the same regimen as the first arm, with the addition of six cycles of consolidation with ofatumumab (1000 mg once every 4 weeks), also given intravenously. The primary endpoint was TFS at 18 months, assessed in those who began consolidation. We estimated the distribution of TFS using the Kaplan-Meier method, assessing between-group differences with log-rank statistics. The phase 2 trial, which is completed, is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01024010. FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2011, and Nov 7, 2012, 34 patients were recruited to this second arm of the trial. Among the 31 (91%) patients who completed induction treatment and started consolidation, 26 (84%) completed the planned six cycles of ofatumumab consolidation. TFS at 18 months was 94.1% (95% CI 78.5-98.5). Grade 3 or worse adverse events deemed at least possibly related to treatment were neutropenia (14 [41%] patients), infection (2 [6%]), and one (3%) each with anaemia, haemolysis, fatigue, and a neurological, metabolic, respiratory, and vascular complication. INTERPRETATION: Ofatumumab-based consolidation appears to be a well tolerated and effective consolidation strategy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which could improve survival.

While acquisition of clonal DNA mutations has been linked to increased rates of secondary AML for individuals older than 60 years, the contribution of RNA processing alterations to human hematopoietic stem and progenitor aging and LSC generation remains unclear. Comprehensive RNA sequencing and splice-isoform-specific PCR uncovered characteristic RNA splice isoform expression patterns that distinguished normal young and aged human stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from malignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML progenitors. In splicing reporter assays and pre-clinical patient-derived AML models, treatment with a pharmacologic splicing modulator, 17S-FD-895, reversed pro-survival splice isoform switching and significantly impaired LSC maintenance. Therapeutic splicing modulation, together with monitoring splice isoform biomarkers of healthy HSPC aging versus LSC generation, may be employed safely and effectively to prevent relapse, the leading cause of leukemia-related mortality.","['Crews, Leslie A', 'Balaian, Larisa', 'Delos Santos, Nathaniel P', 'Leu, Heather S', 'Court, Angela C', 'Lazzari, Elisa', 'Sadarangani, Anil', 'Zipeto, Maria A', 'La Clair, James J', 'Villa, Reymundo', 'Kulidjian, Anna', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Morris, Sheldon R', 'Ball, Edward D', 'Burkart, Michael D', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M']","['Crews LA', 'Balaian L', 'Delos Santos NP', 'Leu HS', 'Court AC', 'Lazzari E', 'Sadarangani A', 'Zipeto MA', 'La Clair JJ', 'Villa R', 'Kulidjian A', 'Storb R', 'Morris SR', 'Ball ED', 'Burkart MD', 'Jamieson CHM']","['Division of Regenerative Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, and Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

MDSCs originate from unusual differentiation of neutrophils or monocytes induced by inflammatory cytokines, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF. However, MDSCs are difficult to detect in neutrophil or monocyte populations because they are not uniform cells, resembling both neutrophils and monocytes; thus, they exist in a heterogeneous population. In this study, we investigated GPI-80, a known regulator of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and associated closely with neutrophil maturation, to clarify this unusual differentiation. First, we demonstrated that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of GPI-80 and coefficient of variation (CV) of GPI-80 were increased by treatment with G-CSF and GM-CSF, respectively, using a human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL60) cell differentiation model. To confirm the value of GPI-80 as a marker of unusual differentiation, we measured GPI-80 expression and MDSC functions using peripheral blood cells from metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients. The GPI-80 CV was augmented significantly in the CD16(hi) neutrophil cell population, and GPI-80 MFI was increased significantly in the CD33(hi) monocyte cell population. Furthermore, the GPI-80 CV in the CD16(hi) population was correlated inversely with the proliferative ability of T cells and the GPI-80 MFI of the CD33(hi) population was correlated with reactive oxygen species production.

METHODS: CREB has been shown to regulate a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, differentiation, metabolism, hematopoiesis, immune response, and neuronal activity. CREB was also identified as a proto-oncogene involving in transformation by promoting abnormal proliferation and survival of myeloid cells. To understand the mechanism of CREB functions in leukemogenesis, the transcriptional profiles from a K562 cell line in which CREB was knocked down were analyzed with the use of bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: DAVID Bioinformatics Resources and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify the targets that are regulated by CREB. A total of 692 genes were up-regulated and 364 genes down-regulated. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in pathways of cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. GSEA analysis showed expression of Notch1 pathway to be decreased and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway to be activated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified candidate gene sets that could be used to guide research on discovering the mechanism of CREB during leukemogenesis.","['Xia, H', 'Gong, Z', 'Lian, Y', 'Zhou, J', 'Wang, X']","['Xia H', 'Gong Z', 'Lian Y', 'Zhou J', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Blood Transfusion, Dongtai People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province, Dongtai, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.

In this paper the authors give an insight into the research of extracellular vesicles in general, and then focus on published findings in hematological malignancies. Quantitative and qualitative changes of microvesicles and exosomes may have value in diagnostics, prognostics and minimal residual disease monitoring of hematological malignancies.

In this study, we further evaluated the antitumor activity of LS-007 alone and in combination with a Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 in acute leukemia (AL) cells. METHODS: Cell viability was detected using resazurin assay, and cell apoptosis was examined using Annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometry. The inhibition of LS-007 on kinases was evaluated with the mobility shift assay or ELISA. The expression of relevant signaling molecules was assessed using Western blotting and RT-PCR. Primary lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were separated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS. RESULTS: LS-007 inhibited the proliferation of 6 AL cell lines with IC50 values of 100-200 nmol/L, and decreased the survival of ALL and AML patient-derived lymphocytes with mean LD50 value of 67 and 102 nmol/L, respectively. In kinase assays in vitro, LS-007 was more selective for the CDK family, inhibiting CDK2, CDK9, CDK1 and CDK4 at low nanomolar concentrations. In HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells, LS-007 (0.1-0.4 mumol/L) dose-dependently induced cell apoptosis predominantly through CDK9 inhibition-related dephosphorylation at the ser2 residue of RNA pol II and the corresponding depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins, especially Mcl-1 and XIAP. LS-007 (0.2 and 0.4 mumol/L) also induced cell apoptosis in the patient-derived lymphocytes. In HL-60, CCRF-CEM and Molt-4 cells, combined application of LS-007 with ABT-199 (1 or 2 mumol/L) markedly increased cell apoptosis with a maximal decrease in the XIAP levels as compared with either drug used alone. CONCLUSION: CDK inhibitor LS-007 potently inhibits the established human AL cell lines and primary AL blasts, and it also shows remarkable synergy with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199.","['Xie, Shao', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Zhai, Xiao-Wen', 'Wei, Fan', 'Wang, Shu-Dong', 'Ding, Jian', 'Chen, Yi']","['Xie S', 'Jiang H', 'Zhai XW', 'Wei F', 'Wang SD', 'Ding J', 'Chen Y']","['Division of Anti-tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", 'Division of Anti-tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.', 'Division of Anti-tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Division of Anti-tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC5099409,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['aps201649 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2016.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2016 Nov;37(11):1481-1489. doi: 10.1038/aps.2016.49.

Herein we describe a 22-year-old male patient with unusual clinical presentation of EMS. Namely, he initially presented with prolonged epistaxis. Complete blood count showed elevated hemoglobin (17.7g/dl), thrombocytopenia (98x109/l) and leukocytosis (57x109/l). Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy findings corresponded with the presence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm while cytogenetic analysis revealed t(8;13)(p11q12). After that ZMYM2-FGFR1 in-frame fusion was confirmed at the molecular level. Immediately after establishing the diagnosis of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) generalized lymphadenopathy was developed. Histopathologic examination of lymph node sample confirmed the diagnosis of a T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma without bone marrow involvement. Four cycles of Hyper CVAD chemotherapy were administered with complete morphological and cytogenetic remission. Four weeks after evaluation, patient developed peripheral blood monocytosis and eosinophilia without bone marrow criteria for acute leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis showed t(8;13) accompanied by complex numerical and structural aberrations. The patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from HLA matched sister and he subsequently achieved complete remission. In conclusion, patients with MPN and translocations involving chromosome 8 need to be carefully evaluated for EMS.

B-ALL is the most common type in pediatric ALL. Risk stratification is critical for setting on chemo-therapeutic regimen that has great impact on the survival rate. But the risk allocation schemas at present were not satisfied. We performed a proteomic study expecting to figure out the critical altered proteins which can indicate the risk rank. We depicted 86 differently expressed proteins in the high-risk childhood B-ALL, and 35 proteins were predicted to have directive interactions. We validated five identified proteins by immunoblot using specimens same as proteomics, and others different from that. We found the differently expressed proteins participated in pre-mRNA spicing, DNA damage response, and stress response which indicated different events happened in the high risk B-ALL. Our result provided new information for children B-ALL. It might aid more accurate risk stratification and might also be valuable to find new therapeutic targets. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic analysis comparing the differentially expressed proteins between high risk and low risk of childhood B-ALL by a label-free quantitative proteomics. We found in high risk B-ALL, the aberrant evens happened in pre-mRNA splicing, DNA damage response, and stress response. This study reveals new insights in the high risk B-ALL, and might also be valuable to identify the high-risk more accurately, as well as to find new therapeutic targets.","['Xu, Gang', 'Li, Zhijie', 'Wang, Lili', 'Chen, Fang', 'Chi, Zuofei', 'Gu, Min', 'Li, Shuang', 'Wu, Di', 'Miao, Jianing', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Hao, Liangchun', 'Fan, Yang']","['Xu G', 'Li Z', 'Wang L', 'Chen F', 'Chi Z', 'Gu M', 'Li S', 'Wu D', 'Miao J', 'Zhang Y', 'Hao L', 'Fan Y']","['Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.

In the last decade, several findings have substantially revolutionized the old concept that CLL is a disease originating from mature, not-dividing cell with indolent clinical course. Notably, next generation sequencing (NGS) has contributed to deepen the knowledge of the cellular networks that imply the onset and the progression of CLL. Among genetic aberrations that are recurrently observed in B-cells from patients with CLL, microRNA deregulation represented the first epigenetic mechanism that has been identified. Through epigenetic mechanism they can modulate gene expression and interfere with cellular pathways that are involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. Although few studies have shown the prognostic and predictive value of microRNA expression levels, their validation within prospective clinical trials is warranted.","['Ciccone, Maria', 'Calin, George A']","['Ciccone M', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 1950, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX77030, USA. gcalin@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United Arab Emirates,Microrna,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology']",,,2016/08/30 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['MIRNA-EPUB-78004 [pii]', '10.2174/2211536605666160825150219 [doi]']",ppublish,Microrna. 2016;5(2):106-112. doi: 10.2174/2211536605666160825150219.,"['UH2 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate the relationship between DNA damage response (DDR) and leukemogenesis using the Fanca knockout mouse model. We found that chronic exposure of the Fanca(-/-) hematopoietic stem cells to DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C in vivo leads to diminished DDR, and the emergence/expansion of pre-leukemia stem cells (pre-LSCs). Surprisingly, although genetic correction of Fanca deficiency in the pre-LSCs restores DDR and reduces genomic instability, but fails to prevent pre-LSC expansion or delay leukemia development in irradiated recipients. Furthermore, we identified transcription program underlying dysregulated DDR and cell migration, myeloid proliferation, and immune response in the Fanca(-/-) pre-LSCs. Forced expression of the downregulated DNA repair genes, Rad51c or Trp53i13, in the Fanca(-/-) pre-LSCs partially rescues DDR but has no effect on leukemia, whereas shRNA knockdown of the upregulated immune receptor genes Trem1 or Pilrb improves leukemia-related survival, but not DDR or genomic instability. Furthermore, Trem1 cooperates with diminished DDR in vivo to promote Fanca(-/-) pre-LSC expansion and leukemia development. Our study implicates diminishing DDR as a root cause of FA leukemogenesis, which subsequently collaborates with other signaling pathways for leukemogenic transformation.","['Du, W', 'Amarachintha, S', 'Wilson, A', 'Pang, Q']","['Du W', 'Amarachintha S', 'Wilson A', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Divisions of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, UAMS, Little Rock, AR, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160829,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', '*DNA Damage', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genotype', 'Immunomodulation/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Preleukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1']",PMC7163296,,2016/08/30 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/30 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016242 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.242 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):423-433. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.242.

BLIMP-1 expression was frequently associated with the ABC phenotype and plasmablastic morphologic subtype of DLBCL, yet 63% of the ABC-DLBCL patients were negative for BLIMP-1 protein expression. In these patients, loss of BLIMP-1 was associated with Myc overexpression and decreased expression of p53 pathway molecules. In addition, homozygous PRDM1 deletions and PRDM1 mutations within exons 1 and 2, which encode for domains crucial for transcriptional repression, were found to show a poor prognostic impact in patients with ABC-DLBCL but not in those with germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL). Gene expression profiling revealed that loss of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 expression correlated with a decreased plasma-cell differentiation signature and upregulation of genes involved in B-cell receptor signaling and tumor-cell proliferation. In conclusion, these results provide novel clinical and biological insight into the tumor-suppressive role of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 in ABC-DLBCL patients and suggest that loss of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 function contributes to the overall poor prognosis of ABC-DLBCL patients.","['Xia, Y', 'Xu-Monette, Z Y', 'Tzankov, A', 'Li, X', 'Manyam, G C', 'Murty, V', 'Bhagat, G', 'Zhang, S', 'Pasqualucci, L', 'Visco, C', 'Dybkaer, K', 'Chiu, A', 'Orazi, A', 'Zu, Y', 'Richards, K L', 'Hsi, E D', 'Choi, W W L', 'van Krieken, J H', 'Huh, J', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Ferreri, A J M', 'Moller, M B', 'Parsons, B M', 'Winter, J N', 'Piris, M A', 'Westin, J', 'Fowler, N', 'Miranda, R N', 'Ok, C Y', 'Li, Y', 'Li, J', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Young, K H']","['Xia Y', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Tzankov A', 'Li X', 'Manyam GC', 'Murty V', 'Bhagat G', 'Zhang S', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Visco C', 'Dybkaer K', 'Chiu A', 'Orazi A', 'Zu Y', 'Richards KL', 'Hsi ED', 'Choi WW', 'van Krieken JH', 'Huh J', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Moller MB', 'Parsons BM', 'Winter JN', 'Piris MA', 'Westin J', 'Fowler N', 'Miranda RN', 'Ok CY', 'Li Y', 'Li J', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong, China.', 'Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'San Raffaele H.

Within motor networks, spinal motor neurons (MNs) segregate into longitudinally arrayed subtypes, establishing a central somatotopic map of peripheral target innervation. MN organization and connectivity relies on Hox transcription factors expressed along the rostrocaudal axis; however, the developmental mechanisms governing the orderly arrangement of MNs are largely unknown. We show that Pbx genes, which encode Hox cofactors, are essential for the segregation and clustering of neurons within motor columns. In the absence of Pbx1 and Pbx3 function, Hox-dependent programs are lost and the remaining MN subtypes are unclustered and disordered. Identification of Pbx gene targets revealed an unexpected and apparently Hox-independent role in defining molecular features of dorsally projecting medial motor column (MMC) neurons. These results indicate Pbx genes act in parallel genetic pathways to orchestrate neuronal subtype differentiation, connectivity, and organization.","['Hanley, Olivia', 'Zewdu, Rediet', 'Cohen, Lisa J', 'Jung, Heekyung', 'Lacombe, Julie', 'Philippidou, Polyxeni', 'Lee, David H', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Dasen, Jeremy S']","['Hanley O', 'Zewdu R', 'Cohen LJ', 'Jung H', 'Lacombe J', 'Philippidou P', 'Lee DH', 'Selleri L', 'Dasen JS']","['Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Genome Technology Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute and Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.

The drug is used in metastatic non-clear-cell RCC, but data on outcomes in this setting are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of records of consecutive metastatic non-clear-cell RCC patients who received pazopanib in front-line and salvage settings between November 2009 and November 2012. Tumor response rate was assessed by a blinded radiologist using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. PFS and overall survival (OS) times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were identified with non-clear-cell metastatic RCC, 9 received pazopanib in the front-line setting, 20 in the salvage setting after progression of disease with other targeted therapies. Seven patients (24%) had papillary RCC, 4 (14%) had chromophobe, 5 (17%) had unclassified histopathology, and 13 (45%) had other subtypes including collecting duct, translocation Xp11.2, and various subtypes with sarcomatoid differentiation. All patients discontinued pazopanib before analysis. Median PFS was 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.7-NA [not available]) in the front-line group, and 4 months (95% CI, 2.1-9.9) in the salvage group. Median OS was 31 months (95% CI, 9.2-NA) in the front-line group, and 13.6 months (95% CI, 6.4-NA) in the salvage group. CONCLUSION: Pazopanib showed efficacy in patients with metastatic non-clear-cell RCC in the front-line and salvage settings. Toxicity was mild to moderate and manageable. Further studies are needed to evaluate pazopanib's role in non-clear-cell RCC in terms of efficacy and safety.","['Matrana, Marc R', 'Baiomy, Ali', 'Campbell, Matthew', 'Alamri, Suhail', 'Shetty, Aditya', 'Teegavarapu, Purnima', 'Kalra, Sarathi', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Atkinson, Bradley', 'Corn, Paul', 'Jonasch, Eric', 'Elsayes, Khaled M', 'Tannir, Nizar M']","['Matrana MR', 'Baiomy A', 'Campbell M', 'Alamri S', 'Shetty A', 'Teegavarapu P', 'Kalra S', 'Xiao L', 'Atkinson B', 'Corn P', 'Jonasch E', 'Elsayes KM', 'Tannir NM']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Results from clinical trials and experience in clinical practice have shown that ruxolitinib reduces myelofibrosis-related splenomegaly and symptom burden, and improves quality-of-life measures. In addition, ruxolitinib was associated with a survival advantage compared with placebo or conventional therapy in controlled trials. However, owing to the myelosuppressive effects of JAK2 inhibition, ruxolitinib is associated with decreases in hemoglobin and platelet counts, particularly during the first 8-12 weeks of therapy. Close monitoring of blood counts and careful dose management, particularly early in the course of therapy, are essential to avoid unnecessary cytopenias that may prompt premature treatment discontinuation by patients who otherwise would benefit from continued therapy. In general, starting doses and dose reductions should be used as recommended by the prescribing information based on platelet counts. A dose-escalation approach at the start of therapy is only recommended for patients with platelet counts of 50-100 x 10(9)/L. If possible, maximum tolerated doses should be maintained and extended treatment interruptions should be avoided to prevent lack or loss of treatment responses. An individualized dosing approach is key to long-term treatment success.","['Mesa, Ruben A', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Mesa RA', 'Komrokji RS', 'Verstovsek S']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, 13400 E.

However, most brain injury cases are followed with neuroinflammatory stress, which affects the lineage selection of grafted NSCs by promoting astrocytogenesis, thus hampering the potential for neural replacement. The present study investigated the role of miR-17-92 in protecting against detrimental effects of neuroinflammation on NSC differentiation in cell therapy. METHODS: NSCs were treated with conditioned medium from lesioned astrocytes with/without neutralizing antibodies of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or/and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), respectively. Afterward, the levels of p-STAT3 and p-JAK2 were determined by western blotting while expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and beta-tubulin III was assessed by immunostaining. The activation of JAK-STAT pathway and cell differentiation were also evaluated after we overexpressed miR-17-92 in NSCs under different neuroinflammatory conditions. After the transplantation of miR-17-92-overexpressing NSCs into injured mouse cortex, PH3, nestin, GFAP, and NeuN were analyzed by immunostaining. In addition, motor coordination of mice was evaluated by rotarod test. RESULTS: Conditioned medium from lesioned astrocytes activated JAK-STAT pathway and facilitated astrocytic differentiation in NSCs while neutralizing antibodies of LIF and CNTF remarkably attenuated such effects. miR-17-92 cluster repressed the expression of multiple proteins including GP130, CNTFR, JAK2, and STAT3 in JAK-STAT pathway. Overexpression of miR-17-92 in NSCs systematically blocked the activation of JAK-STAT pathway mediated by LIF and CNTF, which facilitated neuronal differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, miR-17-92 increased neuronal generation of grafted NSCs and reduced astrogliosis, which resulted in the improvement of motor coordination of brain-injured mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that miR-17-92 promotes neuronal differentiation of grafted NSCs under neuroinflammatory condition via inhibition of multiple proteins in JAK-STAT pathway.","['Mao, Susu', 'Li, Xiuhua', 'Wang, Jin', 'Ding, Xin', 'Zhang, Chenyu', 'Li, Liang']","['Mao S', 'Li X', 'Wang J', 'Ding X', 'Zhang C', 'Li L']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration, Co-Innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, 226001, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences (NAILS), School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 163 Xianlin Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, China. lijing@sibs.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160827,England,J Neuroinflammation,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Encephalitis/drug therapy/etiology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology/*transplantation', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Rotarod Performance Test', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",PMC5002215,,2016/08/29 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2016/08/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12974-016-0685-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12974-016-0685-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Neuroinflammation. 2016 Aug 27;13(1):208. doi: 10.1186/s12974-016-0685-5.,,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tubulin)']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8230-4598'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Differentiation', '*JAK-STAT pathway', '*Neural stem/precursor cells', '*Neuroinflammation', '*Transplantation', '*miR-17-92']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A survey was completed by 1759 ambulatory cancer survivors at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre which contained demographic questions and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) instrument. Clinical information was abstracted from electronic records and HU scores were calculated using Canadian health state valuations. Construct validity was assessed through correlation of HU and visual analog scale (VAS) scores (Spearman) and by comparing HU scores between performance status groups (effect size). The influence of socio-demographic clinical variables on HU was analyzed by non-parametric between-group comparisons and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Mean EQ-5D HU scores were derived for 26 cancers. Among all survivors, the mean +/- standard error of the mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.81 +/- 0.004. Scores varied significantly by performance status (p < 0.0001) and correlated with VAS (Spearman r = 0.61). The cancer sites with the lowest mean HU scores were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (0.70 +/- 0.03) and pancreatic cancer (0.76 +/- 0.03); testicular cancer (0.89 +/- 0.02) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.90 +/- 0.05) had the highest mean scores. A multiple regression model showed that scores were influenced by disease site (p < 0.001), education level (p < 0.001), partner status (p < 0.001), disease extent (p = 0.0029), and type of most recent treatment (p = 0.0061). CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the first set of HU scores for numerous cancer sites derived using Canadian preference weights. The dataset demonstrated construct validity and HU scores varied by general socio-demographic and clinical parameters.","['Naik, Hiten', 'Howell, Doris', 'Su, Susie', 'Qiu, Xin', 'Brown, M Catherine', 'Vennettilli, Ashlee', 'Irwin, Margaret', 'Pat, Vivien', 'Solomon, Hannah', 'Wang, Tian', 'Hon, Henrique', 'Eng, Lawson', 'Mahler, Mary', 'Thai, Henry', 'Ho, Valerie', 'Xu, Wei', 'Seung, Soo Jin', 'Mittmann, Nicole', 'Liu, Geoffrey']","['Naik H', 'Howell D', 'Su S', 'Qiu X', 'Brown MC', 'Vennettilli A', 'Irwin M', 'Pat V', 'Solomon H', 'Wang T', 'Hon H', 'Eng L', 'Mahler M', 'Thai H', 'Ho V', 'Xu W', 'Seung SJ', 'Mittmann N', 'Liu G']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Biostatistics, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Biostatistics, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Biostatistics, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic (HOPE) Research Centre, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic (HOPE) Research Centre, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Care Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave., Room 7-124, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada. geoffrey.liu@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,New Zealand,Patient,The patient,101309314,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Canada', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2016/08/29 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/08/29 06:00'],"['2016/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40271-016-0190-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40271-016-0190-z [pii]']",ppublish,Patient. 2017 Feb;10(1):105-115. doi: 10.1007/s40271-016-0190-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An abnormality in the expression of these genes may lead to arrest of embryonic cleavage or to altered transcription of factors responsible for further embryonic development. In vitro-produced porcine embryos have a lower developmental potential than embryos produced in vivo. We hypothesized that in vitro embryo culture conditions have an effect on the expression of MEGs at various developmental stages, which may affect their developmental potential. Here, using real-time polymerase chain reaction, we examined mRNA profiles of the MEGs, zygote arrest 1 (ZAR-1), nucleoplasmin 2 (NPM2), and developmentally associated pluripotency protein 3 (DPPA3), in porcine oocytes and embryos produced in vitro and in vivo. Further, we evaluated the effect of the combined addition of EGF, interleukin 1beta, and leukemia inhibitory factor to the porcine in vitro embryo production system on mRNA profiles of selected MEGs. Finally, we studied localization of the MEG protein products in in vitro-obtained oocytes and embryos using confocal microscopy. We found that the ZAR-1 mRNA profile differed throughout in vitro and in vivo embryo development. In the embryos produced in vitro, the decrease in ZAR-1 mRNA levels was observed at the 2-cell stage, whereas in in vivo embryos, ZAR-1 mRNA levels declined significantly starting at the 4-cell stage (P < 0.05). In vitro culture conditions affected transiently also DPPA3 mRNA levels at the 4-cell stage (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the NPM2 mRNA profile during in vitro and in vivo embryo development. The ZAR-1 and DPPA3 proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the oocytes and embryos, whereas the NPM2 protein was found both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. All proteins were expressed until blastocyst stage. The addition of EGF and cytokines to the culture medium decreased DPPA3 mRNA levels in 8-cell embryos (P < 0.05). This study indicated that IVC conditions affect ZAR-1 mRNA levels before the 4-cell stage, which may disturb the activation of the embryonic genome in pigs. The expression of the proteins after the 4-cell to 8-cell transition indicates that these factors play a role beyond activation of the embryonic genome. Supplementation of the culture media with EGF and cytokines affects DPPA3 mRNA levels after maternal to embryonic transition.","['Wasielak, M', 'Wiesak, T', 'Bogacka, I', 'Jalali, B Moza', 'Bogacki, M']","['Wasielak M', 'Wiesak T', 'Bogacka I', 'Jalali BM', 'Bogacki M']","['Department of Gamete and Embryo Biology, Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Olsztyn, Poland.

Cytogenetics and mutation testing remain important prognostic tools for treatment after induction therapy. The post-induction treatment is dependent on risk stratification. Despite rapid advances in determination of gene mutations involved in the pathophysiology and biology of AML, and the rapid development of new drugs, treatment improvements changed slowly over the past 30 years, with the majority of patients eventually experiencing relapse and dying of their disease. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the best chance of cure for patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease. This review gives an overview about advances in prognostic markers and novel treatment options for AML, focusing on new prognostic and probably therapeutic mutations, and novel drug therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Medinger, Michael', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Passweg, Jakob']","['Medinger M', 'Lengerke C', 'Passweg J']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland medingerm@uhbs.ch.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis']",PMC5070622,,2016/08/28 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2016/08/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['13/5/317 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2016 09-10;13(5):317-29.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,"['Copyright(c) 2016, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'mutations', 'review', 'targeted therapies', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine how often B-lymphoma cell lines are comprised of subclones, we performed immunoglobulin (IG) heavy chain hypermutation analysis. Revealing that subclones are not rare in B-cell lymphoma cell lines, 6/49 IG hypermutated cell lines (12%) consisted of subclones with individual IG mutations. Subclones were also identified in 2/284 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines exhibiting bimodal CD marker expression. We successfully isolated 10 subclones from four cell lines (HG3, SU-DHL-5, TMD-8, U-2932). Whole exome sequencing was performed to molecularly characterize these subclones. We describe in detail the clonal structure of cell line HG3, derived from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. HG3 consists of three subclones each bearing clone-specific aberrations, gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. While donor patient leukemic cells were CD5+, two of three HG3 subclones had independently lost this marker. CD5 on HG3 cells was regulated by epigenetic/transcriptional mechanisms rather than by alternative splicing as reported hitherto. In conclusion, we show that the presence of subclones in cell lines carrying individual mutations and characterized by sets of differentially expressed genes is not uncommon. We show also that these subclones can be useful isogenic models for regulatory and functional studies.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Ammerpohl, Ole', 'Geffers, Robert', 'Hauer, Vivien', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Nagel, Stefan', 'Romani, Julia', 'Rosati, Emanuela', 'Rosen, Anders', 'Uphoff, Cord C', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Pommerenke C', 'Ammerpohl O', 'Geffers R', 'Hauer V', 'MacLeod RA', 'Nagel S', 'Romani J', 'Rosati E', 'Rosen A', 'Uphoff CC', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Genome Analytics Research Group, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Bioscience and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Cell Biology, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Exome/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation']",PMC5325377,,2016/08/28 06:00,2018/03/16 06:00,['2016/08/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['11524 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11524 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 27;7(39):63456-63465. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11524.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD5', 'CLL', 'cell lines', 'clonal evolution', 'subclones']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there is no standard treatment to date, new therapeutic options are needed, especially for NK aggressive tumors. Fyn tyrosine kinase has a key role in different biological processes, such as cell growth and differentiation, being also involved in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. Our previous studies led us to identify 4c pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine compound capable of inhibiting Fyn activation and inducing apoptosis in different cancer cell lines. Here we investigated the presence of Fyn and the effect of its inhibitor in NK malignant cells. Firstly, we showed Fyn over-expression in NK leukemic cells compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Subsequently, we demonstrated that 4c treatment reduced cell viability, induced caspase 3-mediate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NK cells. Moreover, by inhibiting Fyn phosphorylation, 4c compound reduced Akt and P70 S6 kinase activation and changed the expression of genes involved in cell death and survival in NK cells. Our study demonstrated that Fyn is involved in the pathogenesis of NK leukemia and that it could represent a potential target for this neoplasm.

Evidences for a crosstalk between STAT5 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism have recently emerged but mechanisms involved in STAT5-mediated regulation of ROS still remain elusive. We demonstrate that sustained activation of STAT5 induced by Bcr-Abl in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells promotes ROS production by repressing expression of two antioxidant enzymes, catalase and glutaredoxin-1(Glrx1). Downregulation of catalase and Glrx1 expression was also observed in primary cells from CML patients. Catalase was shown not only to reduce ROS levels but also, to induce quiescence in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells. Furthermore, reduction of STAT5 phosphorylation and upregulation of catalase and Glrx1 were also evidenced in leukemia cells co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells to mimic a leukemic niche. This caused downregulation of ROS levels and enhancement of leukemic cell quiescence. These data support a role of persistent STAT5 signaling in the regulation of ROS production in myeloid leukemias and highlight the repression of antioxidant defenses as an important regulatory mechanism.","['Bourgeais, Jerome', 'Ishac, Nicole', 'Medrzycki, Magdalena', 'Brachet-Botineau, Marie', 'Desbourdes, Laura', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, Valerie', 'Pecnard, Emmanuel', 'Rouleux-Bonnin, Florence', 'Gyan, Emmanuel', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Mazurier, Frederic', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice']","['Bourgeais J', 'Ishac N', 'Medrzycki M', 'Brachet-Botineau M', 'Desbourdes L', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Pecnard E', 'Rouleux-Bonnin F', 'Gyan E', 'Domenech J', 'Mazurier F', 'Moriggl R', 'Bunting KD', 'Herault O', 'Gouilleux F']","['CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""CHRU de Tours, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Tours, France."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""CHRU de Tours, Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Tours, France."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""CHRU de Tours, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Tours, France."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'University of Veterinary Medicine, Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""CHRU de Tours, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Tours, France."", 'CNRS UMR 7292, GICC, Universite F Rabelais, Tours, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Glutaredoxins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC5522035,,2016/08/28 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2016/08/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['11480 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11480 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):41876-41889. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11480.,['R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (GLRX protein, human)', '0 (Glutaredoxins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'STAT5', 'antioxidants', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'oxidative stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The production of undesired cDNAs was dramatically suppressed by the specific capture of the target RNA within the particle. Afterward, RT and amplification processes are performed without loss of cDNAs as exchanging the reaction solution. The biomarker gene of chronic myeloid leukemia, Bcr-Abl fusion transcript, is detected in the sensitivity of single mutant leukemic cell mixed in 10(4) normal cell using this protocol with the excellent restraint of non-specific signal.

Hematologic malignancies, however, are less frequently associated with hypercalcemia with the exception of myelomas and T-cell lymphomas. CASE REPORT: This case report describes a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) who developed symptomatic hypercalcemia. None of the pathogenetic mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia already described in the literature could explain the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in our patient. Calcium levels were normalized after initial treatment and remained within normal limits following treatment of the underlying B-CLL. The follow-up period was 26 months. The normalization of calcium levels was closely associated with the drop in the absolute lymphocyte count. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic hypercalcemia in B-CLL is exceedingly rare and only documented a few times in the literature. Hypercalcemia, in the present case, was not caused by any of the mechanisms already described in the literature and responded well to treatment of the underlying B-CLL.","['Koutroumpakis, Efstratios', 'Lobe, Montgomery', 'McCarthy, Lezah', 'Mehdi, Syed']","['Koutroumpakis E', 'Lobe M', 'McCarthy L', 'Mehdi S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY, U.S.A. koutroe@mail.amc.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Pathology, Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Albany, NY, U.S.A.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Albany, NY, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/complications/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2016/08/28 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/08/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['30/5/691 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2016 09-10;30(5):691-4.,,['Humoral Hypercalcemia Of Malignancy'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphocytic leukemia', 'Hypercalcemia', 'malignancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have screened a kinase inhibitor library and performed combination testing to find promising drug-combinations for synergistic killing of AML cells. Cytotoxicity of 160 compounds in the library InhibitorSelect 384-Well Protein Kinase Inhibitor I was measured using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) in three AML cell lines. The 15 most potent substances were evaluated for dose-response. The 6 most cytotoxic compounds underwent combination synergy analysis based on the FMCA readouts after either simultaneous or sequential drug addition in AML cell lines. The 4 combinations showing the highest level of synergy were evaluated in 5 primary AML samples. Synergistic calculations were performed using the combination interaction analysis package COMBIA, written in R, using the Bliss independence model. Based on obtained results, an iterative combination search was performed using the therapeutic algorithmic combinatorial screen (TACS) algorithm. Of 160 substances, cell survival was 50% at <0.5muM for Cdk/Crk inhibitor, KP372-1, synthetic fascaplysin, herbimycin A, PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor IV and reference-drug cytarabine. KP372-1, synthetic fascaplysin or herbimycin A obtained synergy when combined with cytarabine in AML cell lines MV4-11 and HL-60. KP372-1 added 24h before cytarabine gave similar results in patient cells. The iterative search gave further improved synergy between cytarabine and KP372-1.

T-cell exhaustion has been identified as a state of hyporesponsiveness that arises under continuous antigenic stimulus. Nevertheless, contribution of co-stimulatory molecules to T-cell exhaustion in cancer remains to be better defined. This study explores the role of myeloid leukaemia-derived co-stimulatory signals on CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell exhaustion, which may limit anti-tumour immunity. Here, CD86 and inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand (ICOS-LG) co-stimulatory molecules that are found on myeloid leukaemia cells supported Th cell activation and proliferation. However, under continuous stimulation, T cells co-cultured with leukaemia cells, but not with peripheral blood monocytes, became functionally exhausted. These in vitro-generated exhausted Th cells were defined by up-regulation of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3) inhibitory receptors. They were reluctant to proliferate upon re-stimulation and produced reduced amounts of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Nonetheless, IL-2 supplementation restored the proliferation capacity of the exhausted Th cells. When the co-stimulation supplied by the myeloid leukaemia cells were blocked, the amount of exhausted Th cells was significantly decreased. Moreover, in the bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a subpopulation of Th cells expressing PD-1, TIM-3 and/or LAG3 was identified together with CD86(+) and/or ICOS-LG(+) myeloid blasts. Collectively, co-stimulatory signals derived from myeloid leukaemia cells possess the capacity to facilitate functional exhaustion in Th cells.","['Ozkazanc, Didem', 'Yoyen-Ermis, Digdem', 'Tavukcuoglu, Ece', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Esendagli, Gunes']","['Ozkazanc D', 'Yoyen-Ermis D', 'Tavukcuoglu E', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Esendagli G']","['Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Haematology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey. gunes.esendagli@lycos.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160929,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosenescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Escape', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",PMC5095494,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/08/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imm.12665 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2016 Dec;149(4):460-471. doi: 10.1111/imm.12665.

Cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL are used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. However, detecting these is difficult because mature B cells do not readily divide in culture. Here, we present data on two mitogen cocktails: CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30/Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and DSP30/IL-2 in combination with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). METHODS: We analysed 165 cases of CLL with FISH and cytogenetics from January 2011 to June 2013. In 2011, three cultures were set-up: unstimulated, DSP30/IL-2-stimulated and TPA-stimulated. In 2012-2013, two cultures were set-up: unstimulated and stimulated with TPA/DSP30/IL-2. RESULTS: In 2011, FISH had a detection rate of 91% and cytogenetics using DSP30/IL2 had a detection rate of 91% (n = 22). In 2012-2013, FISH had a detection rate of 79% and cytogenetics using TPA/DSP30/IL-2 had a detection rate of 98% (n = 40). The percentage of cases with normal FISH but abnormal cytogenetics increased from 9% in 2011 to 21% in 2012-2013. The TPA/DSP30/IL-2 cultures in 2012-2013 detected more novel abnormalities (n = 5) as compared to DSP30/IL-2 alone (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: TPA/DSP30/IL2 was as good as or better than DSP30/IL2 alone. TPA/DSP30/IL-2 offers a high detection rate for CLL abnormalities with a single stimulated culture and may increase detection of clinically significant abnormalities.","['Holmes, P J', 'Peiper, S C', 'Uppal, G K', 'Gong, J Z', 'Wang, Z-X', 'Bajaj, R']","['Holmes PJ', 'Peiper SC', 'Uppal GK', 'Gong JZ', 'Wang ZX', 'Bajaj R']","['The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Adjusting for age and ancestry, TPMT was the only gene that reached genomewide significance (top hit rs1142345 or 719A>G; P = 8.6 x 10(-61) ). Additional genetic variants (in addition to the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345, defining TPMT clinical genotype) did not significantly improve classification accuracy for TPMT phenotype. Clinical mercaptopurine tolerability in 839 patients was related to TPMT clinical genotype (P = 2.4 x 10(-11) ). Using 177 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), there were 251 SNPs ranked higher than the top TPMT SNP (rs1142345; P = 6.8 x 10(-5) ), revealing a limitation of LCLs for pharmacogenomic discovery.

In the present study, we investigated the expression of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a lymphoma microenvironment using paraffin-embedded tissue samples, and subsequently studied the detailed mechanism of upregulation of PD-L1 on macrophages using cultured human macrophages and lymphoma cell lines. We found that macrophages in lymphoma tissues of almost all cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma expressed PD-L1. Cell culture studies showed that the conditioned medium of ATL-T and SLVL cell lines induced increased expression of PD-L1/2 on macrophages, and that this PD-L1/2 overexpression was dependent on activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). In vitro studies including cytokine array analysis showed that IL-27 (heterodimer of p28 and EBI3) induced overexpression of PD-L1/2 on macrophages via Stat3 activation. Because lymphoma cell lines produced IL-27B (EBI3) but not IL-27p28, it was proposed that the IL-27p28 derived from macrophages and the IL-27B (EBI3) derived from lymphoma cells formed an IL-27 (heterodimer) that induced PD-L1/2 overexpression.

MLL gene rearrangements often generate fusion products of MLL and a component of the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb (AEP) complex. MLL-AEP fusion proteins have the potential of constitutively recruiting the P-TEFb elongation complex. Thus, it is hypothesized that relieving the promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II is the rate-limiting step of MLL fusion-dependent transcription. AEP also has the potential to recruit the mediator complex via MED26. We recently showed that AEP activates transcription initiation by facilitating TBP loading to the TATA element through the SL1 complex. In the present study, we show that the key activity responsible for the oncogenic property of MLL-AEP fusion proteins is the TBP loading activity, and not the mediator recruitment or transcriptional elongation activities. Thus, we propose that TBP loading by AF4 through SL1 is the major rate-limiting step in MLL fusion-dependent transcription.","['Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko']","['Okuda H', 'Takahashi S', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Yokoyama A']","['a Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research , Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology and Oncology , Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology and Oncology , Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan.', 'a Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research , Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology and Oncology , Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160826,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",PMC5053588,,2016/08/27 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2016.1222337 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2016 Oct 17;15(20):2712-22. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2016.1222337.

In a screen for novel chemotherapeutic drug candidates with genotoxic activity, we identified a bisindolylmaleimide derivative, IX, as a small molecule compound with therapeutic potential against CML including drug-resistant CML. We show that Bisindolylmaleimide IX inhibits DNA topoisomerase, generates DNA breaks, activates the Atm-p53 and Atm-Chk2 pathways, and induces cell cycle arrest and cell death. Interestingly, Bisindolylmaleimide IX is highly effective in targeting cells positive for BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL positive cells display enhanced DNA damage and increased cell cycle arrest in response to Bisindolylmaleimide IX due to decreased expression of topoisomerases. Cells positive for BCR-ABL or drug-resistant T315I BCR-ABL also display increased cytotoxicity since Bisindolylmaleimide IX inhibits B-Raf and the downstream oncogene addiction pathway. Mouse cancer model experiments showed that Bisindolylmaleimide IX, at doses that show little side effect, was effective in treating leukemia-like disorders induced by BCR-ABL or T315I BCR-ABL, and prolonged the lifespan of these model mice. Thus, Bisindolylmaleimide IX presents a novel drug candidate to treat drug-resistant CML via activating BCR-ABL-dependent genotoxic stress response and inhibiting the oncogene addiction pathway activated by BCR-ABL.","['Zhang, Xin', 'Jia, Deyong', 'Ao, Junping', 'Liu, Huijuan', 'Zang, Yi', 'Azam, Mohammad', 'Habib, Samy L', 'Li, Jia', 'Ruan, Xinsen', 'Jia, Hao', 'Wang, Xueying', 'Li, Baojie']","['Zhang X', 'Jia D', 'Ao J', 'Liu H', 'Zang Y', 'Azam M', 'Habib SL', 'Li J', 'Ruan X', 'Jia H', 'Wang X', 'Li B']","['Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', ""Divisions of Pathology, Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System and Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Translational Medical Center for Stem Cell Therapy, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Maleimides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/physiology', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",PMC5342526,,2016/08/27 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['11566 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11566 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 25;7(43):69945-69960. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11566.,"['R01 CA155091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL114074/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '0 (bisindolylmaleimide IX)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Bisindolylmaleimide IX', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of TRIB2 indicate that many of the molecular interactions between the single Drosophila Tribbles (Trbl) protein and interacting partners are evolutionary conserved. In this study, we examined the relationship between TRIB2 and cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) family of dual-specificity protein phosphatases (mammalian homologues of Drosophila String), which are key physiological cell cycle regulators. Using co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that TRIB2 interacts with CDC25B and CDC25C selectively. Forced overexpression of TRIB2 caused a marked decrease in total CDC25C protein levels. Following inhibition of the proteasome, CDC25C was stabilized in the nuclear compartment. This implicates TRIB2 as a regulator of nuclear CDC25C turnover. In complementary ubiquitination assays, we show that TRIB2-mediated degradation of CDC25C is associated with lysine-48-linked CDC25C polyubiquitination driven by the TRIB2 kinase-like domain. A cell cycle associated role for TRIB2 is further supported by the cell cycle regulated expression of TRIB2 protein levels. Our findings reveal mitotic CDC25C as a new target of TRIB2 that is degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome system. Inappropriate CDC25C regulation could mechanistically underlie TRIB2 mediated regulation of cellular proliferation in neoplastic cells.","['Liang, Kai Ling', 'Paredes, Roberto', 'Carmody, Ruaidhri', 'Eyers, Patrick A', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'McCarthy, Tommie V', 'Keeshan, Karen']","['Liang KL', 'Paredes R', 'Carmody R', 'Eyers PA', 'Meyer S', 'McCarthy TV', 'Keeshan K']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK. 111220352@umail.ucc.ie."", 'School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. 111220352@umail.ucc.ie.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, University of Manchester, Manchester M20 3LJ, UK.

EBV infection, mutations in NF-kappaB pathway genes, and genetic susceptibility are known risk factors for developing HL. CD30 and NF-kappaB have been identified as potential biomarkers in pediatric HL patients, and these molecules may represent therapeutic targets. Although current risk adapted and response based treatment approaches yield overall survival rates of >95%, treatment of relapse or refractory patients remains challenging. Targeted HL therapy with the antibody-drug conjugate Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) has proven to be superior to conventional salvage chemotherapy and clinical trials are being conducted to incorporate Bv into frontline therapy that substitutes Bv for alkylating agents to minimize secondary malignancies. The appearance of secondary malignancies has been a concern in pediatric HL, as these patients are at highest risk among all childhood cancer survivors. The risk of developing secondary leukemia following childhood HL treatment is 10.4 to 174.8 times greater than the risk in the general pediatric population and the prognosis is significantly poorer than the other hematological malignancies with a mortality rate of nearly 100%.

However, recent evidence suggests that combinations of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plus interleukin-6 (IL-6), induce RANKL-independent osteoclastogenesis. The purpose of this study was to better understand TNF/IL-6-induced osteoclast formation and to determine whether RANK is absolutely required for osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion in murine inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Myeloid precursors from wild-type (WT) mice or mice with either germline or conditional deletion of Rank, Nfatc1, Dap12, or Fcrg were treated with either RANKL or TNF plus IL-6. Osteoprotegerin, anti-IL-6 receptor (anti-IL-6R), and hydroxyurea were used to block RANKL, the IL-6R, and cell proliferation, respectively. Clinical scoring, histologic assessment, micro-computed tomography, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to evaluate K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis in WT and RANK-deleted mice. Loss of Rank was verified by qPCR and by osteoclast cultures. RESULTS: TNF/IL-6 generated osteoclasts in vitro that resorbed mineralized tissue through a pathway dependent on IL-6R, NFATc1, DNAX-activation protein 12, and cell proliferation, but independent of RANKL or RANK. Bone erosion and osteoclast formation were reduced, but not absent, in arthritic mice with inducible deficiency of RANK. TNF/IL-6, but not RANKL, induced osteoclast formation in bone marrow and synovial cultures from animals deficient in Rank. Multiple IL-6 family members (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M) were up-regulated in the synovium of arthritic mice. CONCLUSION: The persistence of bone erosion and synovial osteoclasts in Rank-deficient mice, and the ability of TNF/IL-6 to induce osteoclastogenesis, suggest that more than one cytokine pathway exists to generate these bone-resorbing cells in inflamed joints.","[""O'Brien, William"", 'Fissel, Brian M', 'Maeda, Yukiko', 'Yan, Jing', 'Ge, Xianpeng', 'Gravallese, Ellen M', 'Aliprantis, Antonios O', 'Charles, Julia F']","[""O'Brien W"", 'Fissel BM', 'Maeda Y', 'Yan J', 'Ge X', 'Gravallese EM', 'Aliprantis AO', 'Charles JF']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Bone Resorption/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'Osteoprotegerin/pharmacology', 'RANK Ligand/pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'X-Ray Microtomography']",PMC5125876,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.39837 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 Dec;68(12):2889-2900. doi: 10.1002/art.39837.,"['K08 AR062590/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG046257/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR055952/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR060363/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tnfrsf11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tyrobp protein, mouse)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",['NIHMS809280'],,"['(c) 2016, American College of Rheumatology.']",,,,['Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 Dec;68(12):2834-2836.

Recent advances in global methylation profiling coupled with the use of mouse models suggest that aberrant promoter hypomethylation is also a frequent event in hematologic malignancies, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Promoter hypomethylation affects gene expression and, therefore, may play an important role in disease pathogenesis.

Careful microscopic examination of stained blood smear or bone marrow aspirate is still the most significant diagnostic methodology for initial AML screening and considered as the first step toward diagnosis. It is time-consuming and due to the elusive nature of the signs and symptoms of AML; wrong diagnosis may occur by pathologists. Therefore, the need for automation of leukemia detection has arisen. In this paper, an automatic technique for identification and detection of AML and its prevalent subtypes, i.e., M2-M5 is presented. At first, microscopic images are acquired from blood smears of patients with AML and normal cases. After applying image preprocessing, color segmentation strategy is applied for segmenting white blood cells from other blood components and then discriminative features, i.e., irregularity, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, Hausdorff dimension, shape, color, and texture features are extracted from the entire nucleus in the whole images containing multiple nuclei. Images are classified to cancerous and noncancerous images by binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier with 10-fold cross validation technique. Classifier performance is evaluated by three parameters, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Cancerous images are also classified into their prevalent subtypes by multi-SVM classifier. The results show that the proposed algorithm has achieved an acceptable performance for diagnosis of AML and its common subtypes. Therefore, it can be used as an assistant diagnostic tool for pathologists.","['Kazemi, Fatemeh', 'Najafabadi, Tooraj Abbasian', 'Araabi, Babak Nadjar']","['Kazemi F', 'Najafabadi TA', 'Araabi BN']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Control and Intelligent Processing Center of Excellence, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Control and Intelligent Processing Center of Excellence, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Control and Intelligent Processing Center of Excellence, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran; Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics, School of Cognitive Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Med Signals Sens,Journal of medical signals and sensors,101577416,,,PMC4973462,,2016/08/27 06:00,2016/08/27 06:01,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Signals Sens. 2016 Jul-Sep;6(3):183-93.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'automation', 'bone marrow', 'cytoplasm', 'k-means clustering', 'support vector machine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This first-line defense is mediated by a variety of constitutively expressed cell proteins collectively termed ""restriction factors"" (RFs), and they form a vital element of the immune response to virus infections. Over time, however, viruses have evolved in a variety ways so that they are able to overcome these RF defenses via mechanisms that are specific for each virus. This review provides a summary of the universal characteristics of RFs, and goes on to focus on the strategies employed by some of the most important RFs in their attempt to control human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. This is followed by a discussion of the counter-restriction mechanisms evolved by viruses to circumvent the host cell's intrinsic immune defenses. RFs include nuclear proteins IFN-gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16) (a Pyrin/HIN domain protein), Sp100, promyelocytic leukemia, and hDaxx; the latter three being the keys elements of nuclear domain 10 (ND10). IFI16 inhibits the synthesis of virus DNA by down-regulating UL54 transcription - a gene encoding a CMV DNA polymerase; in response, the virus antagonizes IFI16 via a process involving viral proteins UL97 and pp65 (pUL83), which results in the mislocalizing of IFI16 into the cytoplasm. In contrast, viral regulatory proteins, including pp71 and IE1, seek to modify or disrupt the ND10 proteins and thus block or reverse their inhibitory effects upon virus replication. All in all, detailed knowledge of these HCMV counter-restriction mechanisms will be fundamental for the future development of new strategies for combating HCMV infection and for identifying novel therapeutic agents.","['Landolfo, Santo', 'De Andrea, Marco', ""Dell'Oste, Valentina"", 'Gugliesi, Francesca']","['Landolfo S', 'De Andrea M', ""Dell'Oste V"", 'Gugliesi F']","[""Santo Landolfo, Marco De Andrea, Valentina Dell'Oste, Francesca Gugliesi, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, Laboratory of Pathogenesis of Viral Infections, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy."", ""Santo Landolfo, Marco De Andrea, Valentina Dell'Oste, Francesca Gugliesi, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, Laboratory of Pathogenesis of Viral Infections, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy."", ""Santo Landolfo, Marco De Andrea, Valentina Dell'Oste, Francesca Gugliesi, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, Laboratory of Pathogenesis of Viral Infections, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy."", ""Santo Landolfo, Marco De Andrea, Valentina Dell'Oste, Francesca Gugliesi, Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, Laboratory of Pathogenesis of Viral Infections, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,World J Virol,World journal of virology,101608353,,,PMC4981826,,2016/08/27 06:00,2016/08/27 06:01,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5501/wjv.v5.i3.87 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Virol. 2016 Aug 12;5(3):87-96. doi: 10.5501/wjv.v5.i3.87.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA sensors', 'Human cytomegalovirus', 'Intrinsic immunity', 'Restriction factors', 'Viral escape mechanisms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to limitations in radiologic imaging for the diagnosis of this condition, biopsy is a common method for diagnosis, which is invasive and holds potential complications. To identify alternative means for obtaining the diagnosis and assessing the prognosis of this condition, we evaluated biomarkers for biphenotypic HCC-CC using a genetic database. METHODS: To evaluate the genetic associations with each variable we utilized GeneCards((R)), The Human Gene Compendium (http://www.genecards.org). The results of our search were entered into the Pathway Interaction Database from the National Cancer Institute (PID-NCI) (http://pid.nci.nih.gov), to generate a biomolecule interaction map. RESULTS: The results of our query yielded 690 genes for HCC, 98 genes for CC and 50 genes for HCC-CC. Genes depicted in this analysis demonstrate the role of hormonal regulation, embryonic development, cell surface adhesion, cytokeratin stability, mucin production, metalloproteinase regulation, Ras signaling, metabolism and apoptosis. Examples of previously described markers included hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). Novel markers included phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), GPC3, choline kinase alpha (CHKA), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). CONCLUSIONS: GeneCards is a useful research tool in the genetic analysis of low frequency malignancies. Utilizing this tool we identified several biomarkers are methods for diagnosing HCC-CC. Finally, utilizing these methods, HCC-CC was found to be predominantly a subtype of CC.","['Mok, Shaffer R S', 'Mohan, Sachin', 'Grewal, Navjot', 'Elfant, Adam B', 'Judge, Thomas A']","['Mok SR', 'Mohan S', 'Grewal N', 'Elfant AB', 'Judge TA']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Mount Laurel, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Gastrointest Oncol,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,101557751,,,PMC4963376,,2016/08/27 06:00,2016/08/27 06:01,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/jgo.2016.04.01 [doi]', 'jgo-07-04-570 [pii]']",ppublish,J Gastrointest Oncol. 2016 Aug;7(4):570-9. doi: 10.21037/jgo.2016.04.01.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)', 'biomarker', 'cholangiocarcinoma (CC)', 'genetic', 'hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL1 translocations are present in acute leukemias, and mutations in several family members are associated with cancer and developmental disorders. MLL1 associates with a subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD), forming the MLL1 core complex required for H3K4 mono- and dimethylation and transcriptional activation. Core complex assembly requires interaction of WDR5 with the MLL1 Win (WDR5 interaction) motif, which is conserved across the SET1 family. Agents that mimic the SET1 family Win motif inhibit the MLL1 core complex and have become an attractive approach for targeting MLL1 in cancers. Like MLL1, other SET1 family members interact with WRAD, but the roles of the Win motif in complex assembly and enzymatic activity remain unexplored. Here, we show that the Win motif is necessary for interaction of WDR5 with all members of the human SET1 family. Mutation of the Win motif-WDR5 interface severely disrupts assembly and activity of MLL1 and SETd1A complexes but only modestly disrupts MLL2/4 and SETd1B complexes without significantly altering enzymatic activity in vitro Notably, in the absence of WDR5, MLL3 interacts with RAD and shows enhanced activity. To further probe the role of the Win motif-WDR5 interaction, we designed a peptidomimetic that binds WDR5 (Kd approximately 3 nm) and selectively inhibits activity of MLL1 and SETd1A core complexes within the SET1 family. Our results reveal that SET1 family complexes with the weakest Win motif-WDR5 interaction are more susceptible to Win motif-based inhibitors.","['Alicea-Velazquez, Nilda L', 'Shinsky, Stephen A', 'Loh, Daniel M', 'Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Skalnik, David G', 'Cosgrove, Michael S']","['Alicea-Velazquez NL', 'Shinsky SA', 'Loh DM', 'Lee JH', 'Skalnik DG', 'Cosgrove MS']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210 and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210 and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210 and.', 'the Biology Department, School of Science, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202.', 'the Biology Department, School of Science, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210 and cosgrovm@upstate.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160825,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5077178,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35709-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.752626 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Oct 21;291(43):22357-22372. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.752626.

In this regard, the current transition rate of potential novel drugs from bench to bedside is remarkably low. Although many novel drugs show promising data in vitro and in vivo, testing of these medications in clinical phase I trials is often sobering with intolerable toxic side effects leading to failure in FDA approval. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the development of murine model generation in the context of targeted therapy development for the treatment of childhood leukemia, aiming to decrease the attrition rate of progressively complex targeted therapies ranging from small molecules to cell therapy. As more complex therapeutic approaches develop, more complex murine models are needed, to recapitulate closely the human phenotype. Expert opinion: Combining xenograft models for efficacy testing and GEMMs for toxicity testing will be a global approach for pre-clinical testing of complex therapeutics and will contribute to the clinical approval of novel compounds. Finally, this approach is likely to increase clinical approval of novel compounds.","['Bhatia, Sanil', 'Daschkey, Svenja', 'Lang, Franziska', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Hauer, Julia']","['Bhatia S', 'Daschkey S', 'Lang F', 'Borkhardt A', 'Hauer J']","['a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty , Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty , Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty , Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty , Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'a Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty , Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160909,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Species Specificity', 'Toxicity Tests/methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1229297 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Nov;11(11):1081-1091. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1229297.

Because reduced receptivity of endometrium is a cause of abortion, we analyzed the action of PF on the endometrial receptivity. PF increased the level of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a major cytokine regulating endometrial receptivity, and LIF receptor in human endometrial Ishikawa cells. The PF-induced LIF expression was mediated by c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. Adhesion between Ishikawa cells and trophoblastic JAr cells stimulated by PF treatment was abolished by knock down of LIF expression or antagonism of LIFR. In addition, the expressions of integrin beta3 and beta5 were increased by PF treatment in Ishikawa cells. The PF-induced expression of integrin beta3 and beta5 was reduced with an LIFR antagonist. Neutralization of both integrins successfully blocked PF-stimulated adhesion of JAr cells and Ishikawa cells. These results suggest that PF enhanced the adhesion between Ishikawa cells and JAr cells by increasing the expression of integrin beta3 and beta5 via an LIF-dependent pathway.

Finally, a key component of quality care is that it is received equitably across different patient populations, yet several recent studies suggest that there are financial, educational, race-ethnic, and age-related barriers to equitable MDS care.","['Frosch, Zachary A K', 'Abel, Gregory A']","['Frosch ZA', 'Abel GA']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA."", 'Division of Population Sciences and Center for Leukemia, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. gregory_abel@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Hematinics/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Patient-Centered Care', '*Quality of Health Care/economics', 'Quality of Life']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-016-0343-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-016-0343-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2016 Dec;11(6):402-407. doi: 10.1007/s11899-016-0343-0.,,['0 (Hematinics)'],,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Access and evaluation', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Patient-centered care', '*Quality indicators', '*Quality of health care', '*Quality of life']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatment recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European LeukemiaNet state that patients with CML-CP should remain on TKI therapy indefinitely. However, there is increasing evidence from clinical trials that some patients with sustained deep molecular responses may be able to achieve treatment-free remission (TFR), whereby they can suspend TKI therapy without losing previously achieved responses. With many patients achieving deep molecular responses to TKI therapy, there is growing interest in whether such patients can achieve TFR. In addition, adverse events (AEs) with long-term TKI therapy, including both the potential for later-emerging AEs and chronic, low-grade AEs, represent a major motivator for oncologists and their patients to investigate the feasibility of TFR. In this review, we provide an overview of data from TFR clinical trials, discuss the importance of achieving a deep molecular response to TKI treatment, and consider potential reasons for investigating TFR following TKI therapy.","['Caldemeyer, Lauren', 'Akard, Luke P']","['Caldemeyer L', 'Akard LP']","['a Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Franciscan St. Francis Hospital and Health Centers , Indianapolis , IN , USA.', 'a Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Franciscan St. Francis Hospital and Health Centers , Indianapolis , IN , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160810,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1198959 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Dec;57(12):2739-2751. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1198959.

Among these is a rare round-cell sarcoma that harbors a CIC gene rearrangement known as CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcoma, which is most commonly fused to the DUX4 gene. Owing to its aggressive clinical behavior and potential therapeutic implications, accurate identification of this novel soft tissue sarcoma is necessary. Definitive diagnosis requires molecular confirmation, but only a few centers are as yet able to perform this test. Several studies have shown that PEA3 subfamily genes, notably ETV4 (belonging to the family of ETS transcription factors), are upregulated in CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas. We performed a detailed immunohistochemical analysis to investigate ETV4 expression in CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas and their potential mimics (especially Ewing sarcomas). The study cohort included 17 cases of CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas, and 110 tumors that morphologically mimic CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas: 43 Ewing sarcomas, 25 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 20 poorly differentiated round-cell synovial sarcomas, 10 desmoplastic round-cell tumors, 5 BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas, 5 lymphoblastic lymphomas, and 2 rhabdoid tumors. All CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas (on core needle biopsies and open biopsies) were ETV4-positive with a strong diffuse nuclear pattern. Among the other 110 tumors, only six cases (four Ewing sarcomas, one alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and one desmoplastic round-cell tumor) showed focal (<5% of tumor cells) and very weak nuclear expression of ETV4; all other tumors were completely negative for ETV4. We conclude that systematic immunohistochemical analysis of ETV4 makes it possible to diagnose undifferentiated round-cell sarcomas (with no molecular markers for sarcoma-associated translocation) such as CIC-rearranged undifferentiated round-cell sarcoma.","['Le Guellec, Sophie', 'Velasco, Valerie', 'Perot, Gaelle', 'Watson, Sarah', 'Tirode, Franck', 'Coindre, Jean-Michel']","['Le Guellec S', 'Velasco V', 'Perot G', 'Watson S', 'Tirode F', 'Coindre JM']","['Department of Pathology, Institut Claudius Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM U916, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Biopathology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U916, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Biopathology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U830, Laboratory of Genetics and Biology of Cancer, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U830, Laboratory of Genetics and Biology of Cancer, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U916, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Biopathology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160826,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Rhabdoid Tumor/diagnosis', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/diagnosis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/diagnosis', 'Sarcoma, Small Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Synovial/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2018/01/11 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol2016155 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2016.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2016 Dec;29(12):1523-1531. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2016.155.

Erythroleukemia shares clinicopathologic features with myelodysplastic syndromes, especially with erythroid-predominant myelodysplastic syndromes (>/=50% bone marrow erythroblasts). The upcoming WHO revision proposes to eliminate the nonerythroid blast cell count rule and to move erythroleukemia patients into the appropriate myelodysplastic syndrome category on the basis of the absolute blast cell count. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with de novo erythroleukemia and compared their clinico-biological features and outcome with those of de novo myelodysplastic syndromes, focusing on erythroid-predominant myelodysplastic syndromes. Median overall survival of 405 erythroid-predominant myelodysplastic syndromes without excess blasts was significantly longer than that observed in 57 erythroid-predominant refractory anemias with excess blasts-1 and in 59 erythroleukemias, but no significant difference was observed between erythroid-predominant refractory anemias with excess blasts-1 and erythroleukemias. In this subset of patients with >/=50% bone marrow erythroblasts and excess blasts, the presence of a high-risk karyotype defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System or by the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System was the main prognostic factor. In the same way, the survival of 459 refractory anemias with excess blasts-2, independently of having >/=20% bone marrow blasts from nonerythroid cells or not, was almost identical to the observed in 59 erythroleukemias. Interestingly, 11 low-blast count erythroleukemias with 5 to <10% bone marrow blasts from total nucleated cells showed similar survival than the rest of erythroleukemias. Our data suggest that de novo erythroleukemia is in the spectrum of myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts and support its inclusion into future classifications of myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Calvo, Xavier', 'Arenillas, Leonor', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Senent, Leonor', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Ardanaz, Maria Teresa', 'Pedro, Carme', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Montoro, Julia', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Arrizabalaga, Beatriz', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Bonanad, Santiago', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Nomdedeu, Benet', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Sanz, Guillermo F', 'Florensa, Lourdes']","['Calvo X', 'Arenillas L', 'Luno E', 'Senent L', 'Arnan M', 'Ramos F', 'Ardanaz MT', 'Pedro C', 'Tormo M', 'Montoro J', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Arrizabalaga B', 'Xicoy B', 'Bonanad S', 'Jerez A', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Ferrer A', 'Sanz GF', 'Florensa L']","['Laboratorio Citologia Hematologica.

In a previously reported screen, TRIM17 acted as a prominent inhibitor of bulk autophagy, unlike the majority of TRIMs, which had positive roles. Nevertheless, TRIM17 showed biochemical hallmarks of autophagy-inducing TRIMs. To explain this paradox, here, we investigated how TRIM17 inhibits selective autophagic degradation of a subset of targets while promoting degradation of others. We traced the inhibitory function of TRIM17 to its actions on the anti-autophagy protein Mcl-1, which associates with and inactivates Beclin 1. TRIM17 expression stabilized Mcl-1-Beclin-1 complexes. Despite its ability to inhibit certain types of selective autophagy, TRIM17 promoted the removal of midbodies, remnants of the cell division machinery that are known autophagy targets. The selective loss of anti-autophagy Mcl-1 from TRIM17-Beclin-1 complexes at midbodies correlated with the ability of TRIM17 to promote midbody removal. This study further expands the roles of TRIMs in regulating selective autophagy by showing that a single TRIM can, depending upon a target, either positively or negatively regulate autophagy.","['Mandell, Michael A', 'Jain, Ashish', 'Kumar, Suresh', 'Castleman, Moriah J', 'Anwar, Tahira', 'Eskelinen, Eeva-Liisa', 'Johansen, Terje', 'Prekeris, Rytis', 'Deretic, Vojo']","['Mandell MA', 'Jain A', 'Kumar S', 'Castleman MJ', 'Anwar T', 'Eskelinen EL', 'Johansen T', 'Prekeris R', 'Deretic V']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 915 Camino de Salud, Albuquerque, NE NM 87131 USA mmandell@salud.unm.edu vderetic@salud.unm.edu.', 'Molecular Cancer Research Group, Institute of Medical Biology, University of Tromso - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso 9037, Norway Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo N-0379, Norway Center for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslow, Montebello, Oslo N-0379, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 915 Camino de Salud, Albuquerque, NE NM 87131 USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 915 Camino de Salud, Albuquerque, NE NM 87131 USA.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki 00014, Finland.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki 00014, Finland.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo N-0379, Norway.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, 12801 East 17th Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 915 Camino de Salud, Albuquerque, NE NM 87131 USA mmandell@salud.unm.edu vderetic@salud.unm.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160825,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Beclin-1/metabolism', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC5087653,['The authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],2016/08/27 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.190017 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.190017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2016 Oct 1;129(19):3562-3573. doi: 10.1242/jcs.190017.

METHODS: Primary human chondrocytes were isolated, cultured, and then subjected to the static compressive loading for 0, 2, 12, 24, 48 h, respectively.The expressions of Piezo1 and the ERK1/2 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(PT-PCR), as well as the apoptosis gene B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2(Bcl-2) Bel-associated X protein(Bax). In addition, Piezo1inhibitor, Grammostola spatulata mechanotoxin 4(GsMTx4), was used to block Piezo1, served as a positive control.The immunofluorescence was used to locate the expression of Piezo1 protein and ERK1/2.AnnexinV-PI was used to detect the apoptosis of chondrocytes. RESULTS: The expression of the Piezo1 in chondrocytesis was weak, the 12 h group was significant increased(0.198 1 vs 0.021 4, P<0.05), the 24 h group was the highest expression while the expression of the 48 h group was lower than the 24 h group, as well as the ERK1/2, Bcl-2 and caspase3.The result of AV-PI had shown that the 2 h group had increased early stage of apoptosis.The 12 h group had increased late stage of apoptosis, and the 24 h group's apoptotic rate was the highest, while the apoptotic rate of the 48 h group was lower than the 24 h group(0.497 1 vs 0.743 1, q=0.035 9). The GsMTx4 could inhibit the late stage of apoptosis, and the location of the Piezo1 was expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Piezo1 plays an important role in the apoptosis of the human chondrocyte through the classic MAPK/ERK1/2 signal pathway.","['Li, X F', 'Zhang, Z', 'Li, X D', 'Wang, T B', 'Zhang, H N']","['Li XF', 'Zhang Z', 'Li XD', 'Wang TB', 'Zhang HN']","['Department of Joint Surgery, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Chondrocytes', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2016.31.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Aug 16;96(31):2472-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2016.31.007.,,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (PIEZO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was a genetic and clinical characterization of Ph-like ALL in adults. Twenty-six (13%) of 207 adult patients (median age: 42 years) with B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) were classified as having Ph-like ALL using gene expression profiling. The frequency of Ph-like ALL was 27% among 95 BCP-ALL patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A-rearrangements. IGH-CRLF2 rearrangements (6/16; P=0.002) and mutations in JAK2 (7/16; P<0.001) were found exclusively in the Ph-like ALL subgroup. Clinical and outcome analyses were restricted to patients treated in German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL (GMALL) trials 06/99 and 07/03 (n=107). The complete remission rate was 100% among both Ph-like ALL patients (n=19) and the ""remaining BCP-ALL"" cases (n=40), i.e. patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A-rearrangements and the Ph-like subtype. Significantly fewer Ph-like ALL patients reached molecular complete remission (33% versus 79%; P=0.02) and had a lower probability of continuous complete remission (26% versus 60%; P=0.03) and overall survival (22% versus 64%; P=0.006) at 5 years compared to the remaining BCP-ALL patients. The profile of genetic lesions in adults with Ph-like ALL, including older adults, resembles that of pediatric Ph-like ALL and differs from the profile in the remaining BCP-ALL. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Ph-like ALL is associated with inferior outcomes in intensively treated older adult patients. Ph-like adult ALL should be recognized as a distinct, high-risk entity and further research on improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is needed.

In order to improve such patients' outcome, we conducted a phase 2, prospective, multicenter trial to test the feasibility of a new sequential regimen, combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy and a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen, before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Twenty-four patients (median age, 47 years) with acute myeloid leukemia in primary treatment failure were included. Cytogenetic risk was poor in 15 patients (62%) and intermediate in nine (38%). The sequential regimen consisted of clofarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) and cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m(2)/day) for 5 days, followed, after a 3-day rest, by reduced-intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation combining cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg), intravenous busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day) for 2 days and anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 days. Patients in complete remission at day +120 received prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion. Eighteen patients (75%) achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was 54% (95% CI: 33-71) at 1 year and 38% (95% CI: 18-46) at 2 years. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of leukemia-free survival was 46% (95% CI: 26-64) at 1 year and 29% (95% CI: 13-48) at 2 years. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 8% (95% CI: 1-24) at 1 year and 12% (95% CI: 3-19) at 2 years.

Also, biodegradability measurements of P(MAA-co-MMA)-starch composites were carried out to examine the effects of degradation of the starch. Then, l-ASNase was immobilized on the P(MAA-co-MMA)-starch composites. The surface morphology of the composite before and after immobilization was characterized by SEM, EDX, and AFM. The properties of the immobilized l-ASNase were investigated and compared with the free enzyme. The immobilized l-ASNase had better showed thermal and pH stability, and remained stable after 30days of storage at 25 degrees C. Thus, based on the findings of the present work, the P(MAA-co-MMA)-starch composite can be exploited as the biocompatible matrix used for l-ASNase immobilization for medical applications due to biocompatibility and biodegradability.","['Ulu, Ahmet', 'Koytepe, Suleyman', 'Ates, Burhan']","['Ulu A', 'Koytepe S', 'Ates B']","['Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty, Inonu University, 44280, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty, Inonu University, 44280, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Science Faculty, Inonu University, 44280, Malatya, Turkey.

In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of the MLL gene in AML patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 68 MLL gene-positive patients out of 433 newly diagnosed AML patients, and 216 bone marrow samples were collected. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was used to precisely detect the expression levels of the MLL gene. RESULTS We divided 41 patients into 2 groups according to the variation of MRD (minimal residual disease) level of the MLL gene. Group 1 (n=22) had a rapid reduction of MRD level to </=10^-4 in all samples collected in the first 3 chemotherapy cycles, while group 2 (n=19) had MRD levels constantly >10^-4 in all samples collected in the first 3 chemotherapy cycles. Group 1 had a significantly better overall survival (p=0.001) and event-free survival (p=0.001) compared to group 2. Moreover, the patients with >10^-4 MRD level before the start of HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) had worse prognosis and higher risk of relapse compared to patients with </=10^-4 before the start of HSCT. CONCLUSIONS We found that a rapid reduction of MRD level to </=10^-4 appears to be a prerequisite for better overall survival and event-free survival during the treatment of AML. The MRD levels detected by RQ-PCR were basically in line with the clinical outcome and may be of great importance in guiding early allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) treatment.","['Huang, Sai', 'Yang, Hua', 'Li, Yan', 'Feng, Cong', 'Gao, Li', 'Chen, Guo-Feng', 'Gao, Hong-Hao', 'Huang, Zhi', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Yu, Li']","['Huang S', 'Yang H', 'Li Y', 'Feng C', 'Gao L', 'Chen GF', 'Gao HH', 'Huang Z', 'Li YH', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Hepingli, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160826,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Transcriptome']",PMC5012461,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['900429 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.900429 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 Aug 26;22:3009-17. doi: 10.12659/msm.900429.,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regretfully, As2O3-treated cancer patients often suffer from hepatotoxicity. While effective antioxidant and anticarcinogenic actions of allicin have previously been demonstrated, studies indicating how allicin affects As2O3-induced hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation are lacking. Our study, for the first time, elaborates potential details of the hepatoprotective mechanisms of allicin against As2O3-induced liver injury. Wistar rats were administrated allicin (30 mg/kg) 1 h before As2O3 (3 mg/kg) by daily gavage for 2 weeks. Our results indicate that allicin ameliorated As2O3-induced liver dysfunction, oxidative stress, and arsenic accumulation in the liver. Meanwhile, allicin decreased NF-kappaB level and upregulated expression of proteins reduced by As2O3 including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:quinone oxidoreductase 1, and Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9). In addition, allicin promoted B cell lymphoma-extra large expression and suppressed B cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein levels regulated by As2O3. However, neither allicin nor As2O3 affected cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression. In conclusion, allicin attenuated As2O3-induced hepatotoxicity by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway involving KLF9 to inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our findings elucidate a detailed mechanism by which allicin provides protection against As2O3-induced liver injury and support its potential role as an adjunctive therapy for patients suffering from chronic arsenic exposure.","['Yang, Daqian', 'Lv, Zhanjun', 'Zhang, Haili', 'Liu, Biying', 'Jiang, Huijie', 'Tan, Xiao', 'Lu, Jingjing', 'Baiyun, Ruiqi', 'Zhang, Zhigang']","['Yang D', 'Lv Z', 'Zhang H', 'Liu B', 'Jiang H', 'Tan X', 'Lu J', 'Baiyun R', 'Zhang Z']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin, 150030, China. zhangzhigang@neau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160825,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Arsenic/blood/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/genetics/metabolism', 'Disulfides', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/toxicity', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Sulfinic Acids/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/08/27 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/08/27 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12011-016-0821-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12011-016-0821-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2017 Mar;176(1):192-200. doi: 10.1007/s12011-016-0821-1.

A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was constructed and adjusted by patient's age at diagnosis, gender, hospital of treatment, and socioeconomic status. Early mortality was high (12.1%) and malnutrition by different indicators was not associated with mortality at induction phase and at 6th month; a high risk of dying (RR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.08-4.01) was

In the present study, it was assessed complete remission and overall survival of AML patients over 60 years treated with HIC or palliative chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with ECOG </= 2 and adequate organic function received HIC with a base of cytarabine for five or seven days, and an anthracycline for three days. If patients achieved complete remission of leukemia, they received one or two cycles of consolidation with cytarabine. Palliative treatment consisted of supported measures and/or oral or intravenous low-dose chemotherapy. RESULTS: Seven patients treated with HIC achieved complete remission versus only one in the palliative group. Only one patient died during HIC treatment. Median survival for HIC-treated patients was 13.25 months, and only 3.35 months for patients treated with palliative therapy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: AML patients of 60 years or older, with good performance status (ECOG </= 2) and adequate organ function, may benefit from HIC treatment, with better survival, compared with palliative therapy.","['Medrano-Contreras, Jesus', 'Talavera-Pina, Juan Osvaldo', 'Guerrero-Rivera, Susana', 'Gutierrez-Espindola, Guillermo Rodolfo', 'Gomez-Cortes, Cynthia', 'Perez-Rocha, Juan Fernando', 'Terreros-Munoz, Eduardo', 'Meillon-Garcia, Luis Antonio']","['Medrano-Contreras J', 'Talavera-Pina JO', 'Guerrero-Rivera S', 'Gutierrez-Espindola GR', 'Gomez-Cortes C', 'Perez-Rocha JF', 'Terreros-Munoz E', 'Meillon-Garcia LA']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. jjesus1077@yahoo.com.mx.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/26 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2016;54 Suppl 2:S148-55.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chemotherapy', '*Elderly']",,,Quimioterapia intensa frente a quimioterapia paliativa en pacientes con leucemia mieloblastica mayores de 60 anos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the haematopoietic lineages, the BCL-2 family members BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 are known to support cell survival but the individual and overlapping roles of these pro-survival BCL-2 proteins for the persistence of individual leukocyte subsets in vivo has not yet been determined. By combining inducible knockout mouse models with the BH3-mimetic compound ABT-737, which inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W, we found that dependency on MCL-1, BCL-XL or BCL-2 expression changes during B-cell development. We show that BCL-XL expression promotes survival of immature B cells, expression of BCL-2 is important for survival of mature B cells and long-lived plasma cells (PC), and expression of MCL-1 is important for survival throughout B-cell development. These data were confirmed with novel highly specific BH3-mimetic compounds that target either BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1. In addition, we observed that combined inhibition of these pro-survival proteins acts in concert to delete specific B-cell subsets. Reduced expression of MCL-1 further sensitized immature as well as transitional B cells and splenic PC to loss of BCL-XL expression. More markedly, loss of MCL-1 greatly sensitizes PC populations to BCL-2 inhibition using ABT-737, even though the total wild-type PC pool in the spleen is not significantly affected by this drug and the bone marrow (BM) PC population only slightly. Combined loss or inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-2 reduced the numbers of established PC >100-fold within days. Our data suggest that combination treatment targeting these pro-survival proteins could be advantageous for treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies.","['Vikstrom, Ingela B', 'Slomp, Anne', 'Carrington, Emma M', 'Moesbergen, Laura M', 'Chang, Catherine', 'Kelly, Gemma L', 'Glaser, Stefan P', 'Jansen, J H Marco', 'Leusen, Jeanette H W', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Huang, David C S', 'Lew, Andrew M', 'Peperzak, Victor', 'Tarlinton, David M']","['Vikstrom IB', 'Slomp A', 'Carrington EM', 'Moesbergen LM', 'Chang C', 'Kelly GL', 'Glaser SP', 'Jansen JH', 'Leusen JH', 'Strasser A', 'Huang DC', 'Lew AM', 'Peperzak V', 'Tarlinton DM']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160825,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",PMC5108322,,2016/08/26 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016237 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.237 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Aug 25;7(8):e2345. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.237.,,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tnfrsf17 protein, mouse)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We published a meta-analysis examining the role of newer TKIs as first line treatment in chronic phase CML. In view of the recently published data, we decided to update it. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing first line treatment with imatinib to the newer TKIs (nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib). We searched MEDLINE, conference proceedings and databases of ongoing trials up to August 2015. RESULTS: Our search yielded eight trials including 3554 patients. Treatment with the newer TKIs significantly improved major molecular response (MMR) at all time points and increased the rate of complete molecular response (CMR) at 12 and 24 months [relative risk (RR) 2.58, 95% CI 1.98-3.37, six trials and RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.63-2.58, three trials, respectively]. Early molecular response at three months was better with the newer TKIs (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.40, six trials). Importantly, progression rate to accelerated or blastic phase was significantly lower with the newer TKIs at 12, 24 months and 5 years. Yet, there was no difference in all-cause mortality. The risk of adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation increased with the newer TKIs. CONCLUSIONS: With a longer follow-up, the newer TKIs remain more potent than imatinib, yet with no significant effect on survival. As CMR is a prerequisite for treatment discontinuation and cure, the newer TKIs favor treatment cessation.","['Gurion, Ronit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Leader, Avi', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat']","['Gurion R', 'Raanani P', 'Vidal L', 'Leader A', 'Gafter-Gvili A']","['a Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'c Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'c Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'c Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'c Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'b Internal Medicine Department A , Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'c Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160825,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Withholding Treatment']",,,2016/08/26 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2016.1201214 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2016 Sep - Oct;55(9-10):1077-1083. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2016.1201214.

We have previously demonstrated significant micro-environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR) to ATO in APL. Here we demonstrate that this EMDR could be effectively overcome by combining a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) with ATO. A synergistic effect on combining these two agents in vitro was noted in both ATO-sensitive and ATO-resistant APL cell lines. The mechanism of this synergy involved downregulation of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, increase in unfolded protein response (UPR) and an increase in reactive oxygen species generation in the malignant cell. We also noted that PML-RARA oncoprotein is effectively cleared with this combination in spite of proteasome inhibition by bortezomib, and that this clearance is mediated through a p62-dependent autophagy pathway. We further demonstrated that proteasome inhibition along with ATO had an additive effect in inducing autophagy. The beneficial effect of this combination was further validated in an animal model and in an on-going clinical trial. This study raises the potential of a non-myelotoxic proteasome inhibitor replacing anthracyclines in the management of high-risk and relapsed APL.","['Ganesan, S', 'Alex, A A', 'Chendamarai, E', 'Balasundaram, N', 'Palani, H K', 'David, S', 'Kulkarni, U', 'Aiyaz, M', 'Mugasimangalam, R', 'Korula, A', 'Abraham, A', 'Srivastava, A', 'Padua, R A', 'Chomienne, C', 'George, B', 'Balasubramanian, P', 'Mathews, V']","['Ganesan S', 'Alex AA', 'Chendamarai E', 'Balasundaram N', 'Palani HK', 'David S', 'Kulkarni U', 'Aiyaz M', 'Mugasimangalam R', 'Korula A', 'Abraham A', 'Srivastava A', 'Padua RA', 'Chomienne C', 'George B', 'Balasubramanian P', 'Mathews V']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India.', 'Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'UMR-S1131, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', ""Institut Universitaire d' Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", 'UMR-S1131, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', ""Institut Universitaire d' Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/agonists', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",PMC5097069,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016227 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.227 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Nov;30(11):2169-2178. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.227.

Here, we investigated a cohort of 354 CML-BP patients treated with TKIs. We identified +8, an extra Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), 3q26.2 rearrangement, -7 and isochromosome 17q (i(17q)) as the major-route changes with a frequency of over 10%. In addition, +21 and +19 had a frequency of over 5%. These ACAs demonstrated lineage specificity: +8, 3q26.2 rearrangement, i(17q) and +19 were significantly more common in myeloid BP, and -7 more common in lymphoid BP; +Ph and +21 were equally distributed between two groups. Pearson correlation analysis revealed clustering of common ACAs into two groups: 3q26.2 rearrangement, -7 and i(17q) formed one group, and other ACAs formed another group. The grouping correlated with risk stratification of ACAs in CML, chronic phase. Despite the overall negative prognostic impact of ACAs, stratification of ACAs into major vs minor-route changes provided no prognostic relevance in CML-BP. The emergence of 3q26.2 rearrangement as a major-route change in the TKI era correlated with a high frequency of ABL1 mutations, supporting a role for TKI resistance in the changing cytogenetic landscape in CML-BP.","['Chen, Z', 'Shao, C', 'Wang, W', 'Zuo, Z', 'Mou, X', 'Hu, S J', 'DiGiuseppe, J A', 'Zu, Y', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Hu, S']","['Chen Z', 'Shao C', 'Wang W', 'Zuo Z', 'Mou X', 'Hu SJ', 'DiGiuseppe JA', 'Zu Y', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Hu S']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/26 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016231 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.231 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):585-592. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.231.

Patients with t(12;21)/(ETV6-RUNX1) or hyperdiploidy >50 ALL had the best prognosis; those with a negative MRD on day 19 had a particularly low risk of relapse: 1.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Patients with NCI high-risk B-ALL or T-cell ALL had an inferior outcome; even with undetectable MRD on day 46, cumulative risk of relapse was 12.7% and 15.5%, respectively. Among patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL, the outcome was intermediate overall but was poor if MRD was 1% on day 19 or MRD was detectable at any level on day 46.

Consolidation after SCT increases hematologic complete response (CR) rates and may improve overall survival (OS) for patients with <CR. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for 143 patients who underwent RA-SCT with or without consolidation. Melphalan was administered at 100 (14%), 140 (52%) and 200 (34%) mg/m(2). The TRM rate at 100 days was 5%. RA-SCT resulted in CR in 24% (3 months) and 48% (12 months) of patients. The CR rate was particularly high (62%) in patients offered bortezomib consolidation. With a median follow-up among survivors of 7.7 years, median event-free survival (EFS) with RA-SCT was 4.04 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.41-5.01 years); median OS was 10.4 years (95% CI: 7.3-not achieved). Patients with CR at 12 months after SCT had significantly longer EFS (P=0.01) and OS (P=0.04). In a multivariate analysis, melphalan dose had no impact on EFS (P=0.26) or OS (P=0.11). For selected patients, RA-SCT was safe and was associated with extended long-term survival. With the availability of novel agents for consolidation, RA-SCT remains a very effective and important backbone treatment for AL amyloidosis.","['Landau, H', 'Smith, M', 'Landry, C', 'Chou, J F', 'Devlin, S M', 'Hassoun, H', 'Bello, C', 'Giralt, S', 'Comenzo, R L']","['Landau H', 'Smith M', 'Landry C', 'Chou JF', 'Devlin SM', 'Hassoun H', 'Bello C', 'Giralt S', 'Comenzo RL']","['Department of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amyloidosis/*drug therapy/*mortality/therapy', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",PMC5220129,"['MS, CL, JFC, SMD, CB and SG have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

As demonstrated by flow cytometry, the immunophenotypes are able to determine the stages of B cell development. Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) is more accurate at identifying cell populations. In this study, 9-color panels, including CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD79a, CD179a, and IgM, which are sequentially expressed during B cell development, were designed to detect the leukemia cell subpopulations in adult B-ALL patients. In 23 patients at diagnosis, 192 heterogeneous subpopulations of leukemia cells were detected. Compared with their counterparts at diagnosis and after the 1st course of induction therapy, the responses of the subpopulations were also heterogeneous. In the CD10 population, the residual B cell subpopulations in the BCR/ABL patients were obviously reduced compared to those in the BCR/ABL patients. New subpopulations were detected in 22 of 23 patients and were primarily located in the CD34CD10 populations. Subpopulations of clonal evolution were heterogeneous after induction therapy. Our results suggest that the subpopulations in B-ALL patients should be dynamically monitored by development-associated immunophenotyping before, during, and after induction therapy and to predict the prognosis of the disease.","['Li, Hui-Fang', 'Meng, Wen-Tong', 'Jia, Yong-Qian', 'Jiang, Neng-Gang', 'Zeng, Ting-Ting', 'Jin, Yong-Mei', 'Huang, Qiao-Rong', 'Li, Xue', 'Xu, Hong', 'Mo, Xian-Ming']","['Li HF', 'Meng WT', 'Jia YQ', 'Jiang NG', 'Zeng TT', 'Jin YM', 'Huang QR', 'Li X', 'Xu H', 'Mo XM']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy Department of Hematology Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'CD79 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",PMC5400307,,2016/08/26 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000004128 [doi]', '00005792-201608230-00018 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Aug;95(34):e4128. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004128.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (VPREB1 protein, human)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27559554,,Publisher,,,,,,2003 Mar 10,,,,"Technology and target group: Cancer vaccines are intended to stimulate the patient's own immune system to attack cancer cells. These vaccines can be used for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. The goal of prophylactic vaccination is to prevent cancer from appearing in the population. For the foreseeable future, prophylactic vaccines will probably be used only to a limited extent. Current research is targeted mainly at developing therapeutic vaccines that can reduce tumor volume or offer protection against relapse in patients who have had cancer already. The greatest progress in cancer vaccine research has been made in malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and colon cancer. Patient benefit: To date, only few results have been reported from early clinical trials, often based on very few patients. Tumor reduction has been noted in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphatic leukemia. Tumors in some patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma temporarily, but completely, disappeared after vaccination. A study of 38 patients with malignant myeloma showed a significant extension in the time to relapse, from 0.6 years to 1.6 years. Furthermore, the 3-year survival rate increased from 33 percent to 53 percent in the vaccinated group. A study of 254 patients with colon cancer showed in followup after 5 years that 20 percent of the vaccinated patients had relapsed compared to 32 percent in the control group. Economic aspects: The costs for administering vaccines are estimated to be low since vaccination is delivered in ambulatory care settings. The initial prices for vaccines are estimated to be relatively high and will vary widely depending on the manufacturing process used. No information is available on the cost effectiveness of this method. Scientific evidence: Tumor vaccination is an experimental treatment method under development and is used only within the framework of scientific studies. There is poor documentation concerning the patient benefit of cancer vaccination. There is no documentation describing the cost effectiveness of the method. No tumor vaccines have yet been approved for use in Sweden.",,,,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book']",,Stockholm,,,,,,,,2016/08/26 06:00,2016/08/26 06:00,,,['NBK379386 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2003 by the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.'],['Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20160826,['Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU)'],['SBU Systematic Review Summaries'],['Tumor Vaccination'],['2016/08/26 06:00']

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical case records of pediatric palliative care patients over a period of 5 years from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. Descriptive summaries of demographic, clinical variables, and patient circumstances at the time of referral and during end-of-life care were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1135 patients were referred from pediatric oncology with a gradual increasing trend over 5 years. About 84.6% consultations took place in the outpatient setting. In 97.9% of the cases, parents were the primary caregivers. Availability of specialist pediatric health-care services at local places was available in 21.2% cases and 48% families earned <5000 INR (approximately 73 USD) in a month. Around 28.3% of the referrals were from leukemia clinic and maximum references were late with 72.4% patients having advanced disease at presentation. 30.3% of the referrals were made for counseling and communication and 54.2% had high symptom burden during referral. After referral, 21.2% patients continued with oral metronomic chemotherapy and 10.5% were referred back to oncology services for palliative radiotherapy. Only 4.9% patients had more than 2 follow-ups. 90.8% of the patients were cared for at home in the last days of illness by local general practitioners. 70.6% of the deaths were anticipated. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists referred patients late in the course of disease trajectory. Most of the referrals were made for counseling and communication, but many patients had high symptom burden during referral.","['Ghoshal, Arunangshu', 'Salins, Naveen', 'Damani, Anuja', 'Deodhar, Jayita', 'Muckaden, MaryAnn']","['Ghoshal A', 'Salins N', 'Damani A', 'Deodhar J', 'Muckaden M']","['Department of Palliative Medicine, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Palliative Medicine, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Palliative Medicine, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Palliative Medicine, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Palliative Medicine, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Indian J Palliat Care,Indian journal of palliative care,101261221,,,PMC4973486,,2016/08/26 06:00,2016/08/26 06:01,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-1075.185031 [doi]', 'IJPC-22-266 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Palliat Care. 2016 Jul-Sep;22(3):266-73. doi: 10.4103/0973-1075.185031.,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Oncology', 'Paediatrics', 'Specialist palliative care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
