The importance of DNA demethylation, non-coding and imprinted genes, metabolic stress, and cell transdifferentiation processes in cancer and non-cancer diseases were addressed in several lectures in a very participative and dynamic atmosphere. The meeting brought together leading figures in the field of cancer epigenetics to present their research work from the last five years. Experts in different areas of oncology described important advances in colorectal, lung, neuroblastoma, leukemia, and lymphoma cancers. The workshop also provided an interesting forum for pediatrics, and focused on the need to improve the treatment of childhood tumors in order to avoid, as far as possible, brain damage and disruption of activity in areas of high plasticity. From the beginning, the relevance of ""omics"" and the advances in genome-wide analysis platforms, which allow cancer to be studied in a more comprehensive and inclusive way, was very clear. Modern ""omics"" offer the possibility of identifying metastases of uncertain origin and establishing epigenetic signatures linked to a specific cluster of patients with a particular prognosis. In this context, invited speakers described novel tumor-associated histone variants and DNA-specific methylation, highlighting their close connection with other processes such as cell-lineage commitment and stemness.","['Vizoso, Miguel', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Vizoso M', 'Esteller M']","['Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC); Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL); Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130724,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics/methods', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics']",PMC3883777,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'chromatin', 'epigenetics', 'histone modifications', 'non-coding RNAs']",2013/07/26 06:00,2014/07/10 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['25856 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.25856 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2013 Sep;8(9):998-1003. doi: 10.4161/epi.25856.

Moreover, aberrant pre-BCR and BCR signalling have a central role in B cell neoplasia; for example, enhanced positive signalling or disrupted negative signalling downstream of the pre-BCR promotes B cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The emerging distinctions between tonic and chronic active BCR signalling have contributed to the identification of oncogenic targets downstream of BCR signalling in mature B cell neoplasms. Indeed, the encouraging results of several ongoing clinical trials that target the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta-isoform (PI3Kdelta), Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) or spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) downstream of the BCR highlight the therapeutic potential of inhibiting BCR signalling.","['Rickert, Robert C']",['Rickert RC'],"['Program on Inflammatory Diseases, Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. robert@sanfordburnham.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,England,Nat Rev Immunol,Nature reviews.

In an attempt to enhance the ADCC function of SMIP-016, the chimeric version of TRU-016, SMIP-016(GV) was engineered with a modification in a glycosylation site in the Fc domain. The wild-type and glycovariant SMIP proteins mediate comparable Type I antibody-like direct cytotoxicity in the presence of anti-human Fc crosslinker and show a similar tyrosine phosphorylation pattern post-treatment. However, NK cells stimulated with the SMIP-016(GV) exhibit enhanced activation and release 3-fold more interferon-gamma compared with SMIP-016. SMIP-016(GV) shows enhanced ADCC function against cells expressing CD37 with NK cell effectors derived from both normal and CLL-affected individuals. Enhanced ADCC is observed against CLL cells and is sustained at concentrations of SMIP-016(GV) as low at 5E(-6) microg/mL on cells expressing minimal CD37 antigen. In support of the biological relevance of this, SMIP-016(GV) mediates effective ADCC against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with low surface expression of CD37.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of plasma interleukin (IL) levels as indicators of high-risk FN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with haematological malignancies and FN were enrolled prospectively. A blood sample was obtained within 24-h of admission for estimation of IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were stratified into three groups. Group I (low-risk): No focus of infection; Group II: Clinical/radiological focus of infection; Group III: Microbiologically proven infection or FN related mortality. Groups II and III were analysed as high-risk. The cytokines were assessed at three different cut-off levels. RESULTS: A total of 52 episodes of FN in 48 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 6 years (range: 2-13). Primary diagnosis included acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (82%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (13%) and acute myeloid leukaemia (5%). Absolute neutrophil count was < 200 cells/mul in half and 200-500 in 23%. Majority were categorised as Group I (69%), followed by Group II (16%) and III (15%). The range of IL-5 was too narrow and similar in the two risk-groups to be of any relevance. The best sensitivity of TNF-alpha and IL-6 for high-risk group was 78% and 70%, respectively. The highest specificity observed was 35%. The negative predictive value of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha exceeded 80%.

Although afatinib (BIBW2992), a second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKI, was expected to overcome the acquired resistance, it showed limited efficacy in a recent phase III clinical study. In this study, we found that the inhibition of glycolysis using 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) improves the efficacy of afatinib in H1975 and PC9-GR NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M. Treatment with the combination of 2DG and afatinib induced intracellular ATP depletion in both H1975 and PC9-GR cells, resulting in activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation played a central role in the cytotoxicity of the combined treatment with 2DG and afatinib through the inhibition of mTOR. The alteration of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway by the inhibition of glucose metabolism induced specific downregulation of Mcl-1, a member of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family, through translational control. The enhancement of afatinib sensitivity by 2DG was confirmed in the in vivo PC9-GR xenograft model. In conclusion, this study examined whether the inhibition of glucose metabolism using 2DG enhances sensitivity to afatinib in NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M through the regulation of the AMPK/mTOR/Mcl-1 signaling pathway. These data suggest that the combined use of an inhibitor of glucose metabolism and afatinib is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with acquired resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs due to secondary EGFR T790M.","['Kim, Sun Mi', 'Yun, Mi Ran', 'Hong, Yun Kyoung', 'Solca, Flavio', 'Kim, Joo-Hang', 'Kim, Hyun-Jung', 'Cho, Byoung Chul']","['Kim SM', 'Yun MR', 'Hong YK', 'Solca F', 'Kim JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Cho BC']","['Corresponding Authors: Byoung Chul Cho, Yonsei Cancer Center, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea. cbc1971@yuhs.ac.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130724,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '41UD74L59M (Afatinib)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Afatinib', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Deoxyglucose/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Quinazolines/*administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics']",,,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-1188 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1188 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Oct;12(10):2145-56. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1188.

Here we report N-acetyl lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC) is an effective inhibitor of MPO activity. We show KYC inhibits MPO-mediated hypochlorous acid (HOCl) formation and nitration/oxidation of LDL. Disulfide is the major product of MPO-mediated KYC oxidation. KYC (</=4,000 muM) does not induce cytotoxicity in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). KYC inhibits HOCl generation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophils and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells but not superoxide generation by PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells. KYC inhibits MPO-mediated HOCl formation in BAEC culture and protects BAECs from MPO-induced injury. KYC inhibits MPO-mediated lipid peroxidation of LDL whereas tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) enhance oxidation. KYC is unique as its isomers do not inhibit MPO activity, or are much less effective. Ultraviolet-visible spectral studies indicate KYC binds to the active site of MPO and reacts with compounds I and II. Docking studies show the Tyr of KYC rests just above the heme of MPO. Interestingly, KYC increases MPO-dependent H(2)O(2) consumption. These data indicate KYC is a novel and specific inhibitor of MPO activity that is nontoxic to endothelial cell cultures. Accordingly, KYC may be useful for treating MPO-mediated vascular disease.","['Zhang, Hao', 'Jing, Xigang', 'Shi, Yang', 'Xu, Hao', 'Du, Jianhai', 'Guan, Tongju', 'Weihrauch, Dorothee', 'Jones, Deron W', 'Wang, Weiling', 'Gourlay, David', 'Oldham, Keith T', 'Hillery, Cheryl A', 'Pritchard, Kirkwood A Jr']","['Zhang H', 'Jing X', 'Shi Y', 'Xu H', 'Du J', 'Guan T', 'Weihrauch D', 'Jones DW', 'Wang W', 'Gourlay D', 'Oldham KT', 'Hillery CA', 'Pritchard KA Jr']","['Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130724,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (N-acetyllysyltyrosylcysteine amide)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cattle', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Halogenation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypochlorous Acid/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Nitrates/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3793606,['NOTNLM'],"['apolipoprotein A1', 'chlorination', 'hypochlorous acid', 'lipid peroxidation', 'low density lipoproteins', 'nitration', 'nitrogen dioxide']",2013/07/26 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2275(20)35053-7 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M038273 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2013 Nov;54(11):3016-29. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M038273.

However, resistant and relapse are common problems in imatinib-treated patients. Although second-generation TKI such as AMN107 appears to improve the treatment of CML, TKI resistance and relapse are also frequently occurred in the patients. To test whether arsenic trioxide (ATO) could potentiate the efficacy of AMN107 in imatinib-resistant cells, we conducted a series of assays in TKI-resistant K562-r cells treated with AMN107 and ATO. Based on a time-course cDNA microarray analysis, we found many genes typically involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling were significantly up-regulated, implicating the occurrence of ER stress-mediated apoptosis in K562-r cells treated with the combination of ATO and AMN107. Such implication was also supported by the data showing the activation of members in the JNK pathway, which are known to be characteristic markers bridging ER-stress and apoptosis. Partial knock-down of the JNK activities alleviated the effects of apoptosis (p < 0.05) triggered by combining AMN107 with ATO. In conclusion, this study for the first time demonstrates a synergistic effect of AMN107 with ATO, allowing insights into the possible mechanisms underlying imatinib-induced resistance in CML. Our data also suggest that combination of AMN107 with ATO may represent a new strategy for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML patients.","['Xia, Yuan', 'Fang, Hai', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Du, Yanzhi']","['Xia Y', 'Fang H', 'Zhang J', 'Du Y']","['Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130724,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AMN107', 'Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'ER stress', 'apoptosis', 'arsenic trioxide', 'imatinib-resistant cells']",2013/07/26 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1535370213492689 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370213492689 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2013 Aug 1;238(8):932-42. doi: 10.1177/1535370213492689.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 165 consecutive bilateral lower extremity MRI examinations performed for suspected musculoskeletal infection in pediatric patients (64% boys and 36% girls; mean age, 7.5 years; age range, 0-18 years) in 2010 at a children's hospital was performed. Imaging findings were compared with the final clinical diagnosis and management. RESULTS: The MRI examination was normal in 2% (4/165). Osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 33% (54/165) of the MRI examinations; among these examinations 20% (11/54) had both ipsilateral septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, 2% (1/54) had bilateral osteomyelitis, and 67% (111/165) of the examinations were negative for osteomyelitis. Bilateral abnormalities were detected in 20% (22/111) of patients without osteomyelitis, with 18% (4/22) presenting with bilateral signs or symptoms. Abnormalities in the contralateral extremity included myositis (18%, 4/22), stress reaction (18%, 4/22), subcutaneous edema (18%, 4/22), leukemia (14%, 3/22), reactive joint effusion (14%, 3/22), Baker cyst (5%, 1/22), and osteonecrosis (5%, 1/22). Identification of clinically unsuspected abnormalities of the contralateral extremity by MRI was not associated with alterations in medical or surgical management in children with or without osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION: Clinically unsuspected abnormalities of the asymptomatic contralateral lower extremity are common in children referred for MRI of suspected musculoskeletal infection. However, detection of these abnormalities is not associated with alterations in patient management.","['Metwalli, Zeyad A', 'Kan, J Herman', 'Munjal, Karuna A', 'Orth, Robert C', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Guillerman, R Paul']","['Metwalli ZA', 'Kan JH', 'Munjal KA', 'Orth RC', 'Zhang W', 'Guillerman RP']","['Department of Radiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, MS-360, Houston, TX 77030, USA. metwalli@bcm.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Results of clonogeneic progenitor cell assays from 52 patients with newly diagnosed CML were correlated with disease characteristics at presentation and molecular response to imatinib. EECs (median 7 per dish, range 1-39) were detectable in 16 patients (31%). The proportion of patients with a high-risk Sokal score was lower in the EEC group (7% vs. 30%, respectively). The cumulative incidence of achieving a major molecular response after 2 years of imatinib was similar for both groups. However, patients with EECs were less likely to achieve a more profound decline of BCR-ABL transcripts. After 6 years of imatinib, the cumulative probability [95% CI] of reaching a >/=4 log reduction of BCR-ABL was 48% [16%; 92%] for patients of the EEC group and 84% [63%; 97%] for patients of the No EEC group.

While T cells bearing stably expressed CARs are efficacious and have potential long-term persistence, temporary expression of a CAR via RNA electroporation is also potentially efficacious in preclinical models. Temporary CAR expression using RNA presents a method of testing CARs clinically with additional safety where there may be concerns about possible chronic ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxic effects, as the degradation of RNA ensures complete removal of the CAR over time without relying on suicide induction systems. CD19-directed RNA CAR T cells were tested in vivo for efficacy and comparison to lentiviral vector (LV)-generated stable CAR T cells. We tested the hypothesis that multiple infusions of RNA CAR T cells preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy could mediate improved survival and sustained antitumor responses in a robust leukemia xenograft model. The saturation strategy using rationally designed multiple infusions of RNA CARs based on multiple model iterations approached the efficacy of a stable LV expression method. Two-color imaging revealed that relapse was a locoregional phenomenon in both the temporary and the stable expression models. In marked contrast to stably expressed CARs with retroviral or LV technology, the efficacy of RNA CARs appears independent of the costimulatory signaling endodomains likely because they more influence proliferation and persistence rather than short-term efficacy. The efficacy of the RNA CAR infusions may approach that of stably expressed CARs, offer theoretically safer initial clinical testing in addition to suicide systems, and allow for rapid and effective iterative preclinical modeling for the testing of new targets.","['Barrett, David M', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Shuguang', 'June, Carl H', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Zhao, Yangbing']","['Barrett DM', 'Liu X', 'Jiang S', 'June CH', 'Grupp SA', 'Zhao Y']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'RNA/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3746289,,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2013.075 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2013 Aug;24(8):717-27. doi: 10.1089/hum.2013.075.,"['R01CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA066726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2-K12-CA-076931-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, new treatments are needed to improve outcomes for Ph(+) ALL patients. In a mouse model of Ph(+) B-lineage ALL, MCL-1 expression is dysregulated by the BCR-ABL oncofusion protein, and TKI treatment results in loss of MCL-1 expression prior to the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that MCL-1 may be an essential prosurvival molecule. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mouse model in which conditional allele(s) of Mcl-1 can be deleted either during leukemia transformation or later after the establishment of leukemia. We report that endogenous MCL-1's antiapoptotic activity promotes survival during BCR-ABL transformation and in established BCR-ABL(+) leukemia. This requirement for MCL-1 can be overcome by overexpression of other antiapoptotic molecules. We further demonstrate that strategies to inhibit MCL-1 expression potentiate the proapoptotic action of BCL-2 inhibitors in both mouse and human BCR-ABL(+) leukemia cell lines. Thus, strategies focused on antagonizing MCL-1 function and expression would be predicted to be effective therapeutic strategies.","['Koss, Brian', 'Morrison, Jeffrey', 'Perciavalle, Rhonda M', 'Singh, Harpreet', 'Rehg, Jerold E', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Opferman, Joseph T']","['Koss B', 'Morrison J', 'Perciavalle RM', 'Singh H', 'Rehg JE', 'Williams RT', 'Opferman JT']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology']",PMC3757371,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53538-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-440230 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 29;122(9):1587-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-440230.

To address the issue of overcoming instability and low transfection efficiency in vitro, the polyethylene glycol-polyethyleneimine (PEG-PEI) nanoparticle was used as non-viral vector carrier for miR-150 transfection, which is downregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia. PEG-PEI [PEG(550)3 -g-PEI(1800) ]/miRNA nanocomplexes were synthesised and characterised by particle size distribution (PSD), polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential, surface charge, their cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency. Interaction with human leukemia cells (K-562 and KU812) and control cells NCI-BL2347 with them has been investigated. The transfection efficiency of PEG-PEI/miRNA at N/P 26 rose 6.7-fold above the control by qRT-PCR. The size of homogenous nanocomplexes (PBI < 0.5) was 160.8 +/- 11 nm.

METHODS: Overall, the pooled study population included 3788 NHL cases and 4279 controls. Risk of NHL and its major subtypes associated with TCE exposure was calculated with unconditional logistic regression and polytomous regression analysis, adjusting by age, gender and study. RESULTS: Risk of follicular lymphoma (FL), but not NHL overall or other subtypes, increased by probability (p=0.02) and intensity level (p=0.04), and with the combined analysis of four exposure metrics assumed as independent (p=0.004). After restricting the analysis to the most likely exposed study subjects, risk of NHL overall, FL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were elevated and increased by duration of exposure (p=0.009, p=0.04 and p=0.01, respectively) and with the combined analysis of duration, frequency and intensity of exposure (p=0.004, p=0.015 and p=0.005, respectively). Although based on small numbers of exposed, risk of all the major NHL subtypes, namely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, FL and CLL, showed increases in risk ranging 2-3.2-fold in the highest category of exposure intensity. No significant heterogeneity in risk was detected by major NHL subtypes or by study. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled analysis apparently supports the hypothesis of an increase in risk of specific NHL subtypes associated with occupational exposure to TCE.","['Cocco, P', 'Vermeulen, R', 'Flore, V', 'Nonne, T', 'Campagna, M', 'Purdue, M', 'Blair, A', 'Monnereau, A', 'Orsi, L', 'Clavel, J', 'Becker, N', 'de Sanjose, S', 'Foretova, L', 'Staines, A', 'Maynadie, M', 'Nieters, A', 'Miligi, L', ""'t Mannetje, A"", 'Kricker, A', 'Brennan, P', 'Boffetta, P', 'Lan, Q', 'Rothman, N']","['Cocco P', 'Vermeulen R', 'Flore V', 'Nonne T', 'Campagna M', 'Purdue M', 'Blair A', 'Monnereau A', 'Orsi L', 'Clavel J', 'Becker N', 'de Sanjose S', 'Foretova L', 'Staines A', 'Maynadie M', 'Nieters A', 'Miligi L', ""'t Mannetje A"", 'Kricker A', 'Brennan P', 'Boffetta P', 'Lan Q', 'Rothman N']","['Department of Public Health, Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Occupational Health Section, University of Cagliari, Monserrato, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['290YE8AR51 (Trichloroethylene)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Trichloroethylene/*toxicity']",,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2013-101551 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2013-101551 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Nov;70(11):795-802. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2013-101551.

Fucoidan treatment of cells resulted in inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimetylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) assay, fluorescence microscopy, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis was associated with the proteolytic activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, insertion of pro-apoptotic Bax into the mitochondria, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, and loss of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) in U937 cells. However, apoptosis induced by fucoidan was attenuated by caspase inhibitors, indicating that fucoidan-induced apoptosis was dependent on the activation of caspases. Furthermore, fucoidan treatment effectively activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, and significantly reduced fucoidan-induced apoptosis through inhibition of Bax translocation and caspases activation, suggesting that the activation of p38 MAPK may play a key role in fucoidan-induced apoptosis. In addition, the authors found fucoidan-induced significantly attenuated in Bcl-2 overexpressing U937 cells, and pretreatment with fucoidan and HA 14-1, a small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, markedly increased fucoidan-mediated apoptosis in Bcl-2 overexpressing U937 cells. Our findings imply that we may attribute some of the biological functions of p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 to their ability to inhibit fucoidan-induced apoptosis.","['Park, Hyun Soo', 'Hwang, Hye Jin', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Cha, Hee-Jae', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park HS', 'Hwang HJ', 'Kim GY', 'Cha HJ', 'Kim WJ', 'Kim ND', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Pharmacy, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Korea. phsvic@naver.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/genetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3736427,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['md11072347 [pii]', '10.3390/md11072347 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2013 Jul 4;11(7):2347-64. doi: 10.3390/md11072347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic variants affecting daunorubicin metabolism are attractive candidates for such biomarkers. METHODS: We have previously shown that 13 of the naturally occurring nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the reductase genes affect daunorubicin metabolism in vitro. Here, we test these SNPs individually and jointly for association with response to one cycle of daunorubicin-based chemotherapy in a sample of 189 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: Of the 13 SNPs included in this study, only 5 passed quality control filters. No association was found between these 5 SNPs and response to one cycle of daunorubicin-based induction therapy in either individual or joint effect tests. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their showing in vitro effect on metabolic rate of daunorubicin, the nonsynonymous SNPs in the reductase genes on their own are not significant contributors to the observed variability in response to daunorubicin therapy and thus, as singularities, are not useful biomarkers of this outcome. IMPACT: The results of this investigation provide important information for studies on personalization of anthracycline-based therapies.","['Lubieniecka, Joanna M', 'Liu, Jie', 'Graham, Jinko', 'Heffner, Daniel', 'Reid, Ronald', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Grigliatti, Tom A', 'Riggs, Wayne K']","['Lubieniecka JM', 'Liu J', 'Graham J', 'Heffner D', 'Reid R', 'Hogge D', 'Grigliatti TA', 'Riggs WK']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Zoology, Life Sciences Institute; Department of Medicine; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia; British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver; and Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidoreductases/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-13-0671 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0671 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Oct;22(10):1918-20. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0671.

MDR transporters play a pivotal role in protecting the cancer stem cells (CSCs) from chemotherapy. It is speculated that CSCs are instrumental in reviving tumors after the chemo and radiotherapy. In this regard, multifunctional nanoparticles that can integrate various key components such as drugs, genes, imaging agents and targeting ligands using unique delivery platforms would be more efficient in treating MDR cancers. This review presents some of the important principles involved in development of MDR and novel methods of treating cancers using multifunctional-targeted nanoparticles. Illustrative examples of nanoparticles engineered for drug/gene combination delivery and stimuli responsive nanoparticle systems for cancer therapy are also discussed.","['Iyer, Arun K', 'Singh, Amit', 'Ganta, Srinivas', 'Amiji, Mansoor M']","['Iyer AK', 'Singh A', 'Ganta S', 'Amiji MM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130721,Netherlands,Adv Drug Deliv Rev,Advanced drug delivery reviews,8710523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Nanomedicine/*methods/trends', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero 3-phosphocholine', 'AAc', 'AML', 'Acrylic acid', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid', 'BCP', 'BK', 'Block copolymer', 'Bradykinin', 'CD', 'CSC', 'CTAB', 'Cancer stem cells', 'Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide', 'Chol', 'Cholesterol', 'Cyclodextrin', 'DDS', 'DLL4', 'DMAEMA', 'DOPG', 'DOX', 'DPPC', 'DSPC', 'Delta-like 4 ligand', 'Dex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol', 'Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug delivery system', 'ECM', 'EGFR', 'EMT', 'EOEOVE', 'EPR', 'Enhanced permeability and retention', 'EpCAM', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'Extracellular matrix', 'GILT', 'Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase', 'HDAC', 'HFMF', 'HIFU', 'HPMA', 'High intensity focused ultrasound', 'High-frequency magnetic field', 'Histone deacetylase', 'IARC', 'IPNs', 'Imaging', 'Infra-red', 'International agency for research on cancer', 'Interpenetrating networks', 'LCST', 'LTSL', 'Low thermosensitive liposomes', 'Lower critical solution temperature', 'MA', 'MAAc', 'MDR', 'MMPs', 'MPS', 'MRI', 'MSNP', 'MSNs', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Maleic anhydride (MA)', 'Matrix metalloproteinase', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles', 'Methacrylic acid', 'Mononuclear phagocytic system', 'Multi-drug resistance', 'Multifunctional nanosystems', 'N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate', 'NGF', 'NIR', 'NO', 'NSCLC', 'NTSL', 'Nerve growth factor', 'Nitric oxide', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Non-thermosensitive liposomes', 'P-glycoprotein', 'P-gp', 'PAA', 'PAM', 'PCL', 'PDDA', 'PDEAAm', 'PDMAEMA', 'PEG', 'PEI', 'PEO', 'PGA', 'PGs', 'PHEA', 'PLGA', 'PNIPAAm', 'PSMA', 'PTMC', 'PVCL', 'PbAE', 'Poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide)', 'Poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)', 'Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)', 'Poly(N-vinlycaprolactam)', 'Poly(amidoamine)', 'Poly(caprolactone)', 'Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)', 'Poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride)', 'Poly(ethylene glycol)', 'Poly(ethylene oxide)', 'Poly(glutamic acid)', 'Poly(trimethylene carbonate)', 'Poly(beta-amino ester)', 'Poly[2-(2-ethoxy)ethoxyethyl vinyl ether]', 'Poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]', 'Polyacrylamide', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Prostaglandins', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen', 'RGD', 'RNA interference', 'RNAi', 'SCLC', 'SP', 'SPIONs', 'Short hairpin RNA', 'Side population', 'Small cell lung cancer', 'Small interfering RNA', 'Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles', 'TF', 'TTSL', 'Targeted delivery', 'Tegafur', 'Thermosensitive liposomes', 'Tumor multidrug resistance', 'UCNPs', 'UCST', 'US', 'Ultrasound', 'Upconverting nanoparticles', 'Upper critical solution temperature', 'VEGF', 'VPF', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor', 'Vascular permeability factor', 'shRNA', 'siRNA', 'alpha,beta-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-d,l-aspartamide']",2013/07/25 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0169-409X(13)00166-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.addr.2013.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2013 Nov;65(13-14):1784-802. doi: 10.1016/j.addr.2013.07.012.

Antrodia camphorata is a medicinal mushroom being widely used as food dietary supplement for cancer prevention. The sesquiterpene lactone antrocin is the most potent among >100 secondary metabolites isolated from A. camphorata. However, the molecular mechanisms of antrocin-mediated anticancer effects remain unclear. In this study, we found that antrocin inhibited cell proliferation in two non-small-cell lung cancer cells, namely H441 (wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor, IC50 = 0.75 muM) and H1975 (gefitnib-resistant mutant T790M, IC50 = 0.83 muM). Antrocin dose dependently suppressed colony formation and induced apoptosis as evidenced by activated caspase-3 and increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Gene profiling studies indicated that antrocin downregulated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that antrocin suppressed both constitutively activated and interleukin 6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and its subsequent nuclear translocation. Such inhibition is found to be achieved through the suppression of JAK2 and interaction between STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Additionally, antrocin increased microRNA let-7c expression and suppressed STAT signaling. The combination of antrocin and JAK2/STAT3 gene silencing significantly increased apoptosis in H441 cells. Such dual interruption of JAK2 and STAT3 pathways also induced downregulation of antiapoptotic protein mcl-1 and increased caspase-3 expression. In vivo intraperitoneal administration of antrocin significantly suppressed the growth of lung cancer tumor xenografts. Our results indicate that antrocin may be a potential therapeutic agent for human lung cancer cells through constitutive inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway.","['Yeh, Chi-Tai', 'Huang, Wen-Chien', 'Rao, Yerra Koteswara', 'Ye, Min', 'Lee, Wei-Hwa', 'Wang, Liang-Shun', 'Tzeng, David T W', 'Wu, Chih-Hsiung', 'Shieh, Yi-Shing', 'Huang, Chi-Ying F', 'Chen, Yu-Jen', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Wu, Alexander T H', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Tzeng, Yew-Min']","['Yeh CT', 'Huang WC', 'Rao YK', 'Ye M', 'Lee WH', 'Wang LS', 'Tzeng DT', 'Wu CH', 'Shieh YS', 'Huang CY', 'Chen YJ', 'Hsiao M', 'Wu AT', 'Yang Z', 'Tzeng YM']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (antrocin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Agaricales/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antrodia/chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2014/04/10 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bgt255 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgt255 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Dec;34(12):2918-28. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt255.

We investigated the possible prognostic factors of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis in children. METHODS: Medical records of children (< 18 years old) with cyclophosphamide-related hemorrhagic cystitis were collected retrospectively from January 2000 to December 2010 in a tertiary care center. We also prospectively enrolled children (< 18 years old) with cyclophosphamide treatment. RESULTS: The retrospective study consisted of 23 patients whose median age was 11 years. The median day of onset time was 1 day after cyclophosphamide usage. The hemato-oncological diseases included acute leukemia (39.1%), lymphoma (13%), blastoma (13%), sarcoma (13%), aplastic anemia (13%), and others (8.7%). Patients who received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) had significantly longer duration of hemorrhagic cystitis than those who did not receive BMT (p < 0.05). Serum uric acid, checked prior to and after the onset of hemorrhage cystitis, was significantly lower after the development of hemorrhagic cystitis (p < 0.05). In the prospective study, 11 children were enrolled with a median age of 5 years. The urinary nitrite/nitrate and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha levels increased significantly after cyclophosphamide usage (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Alteration serum uric acid level and BMT could be indicators for severe hemorrhagic cystitis. The elevated levels of urinary nitrite/nitrate and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha may indicate the essential roles played by nitric oxide syntheses and reactive oxidative stress in cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. These findings may help clinicians formulate a better strategy for treating cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.","['Wang, Ching-Chia', 'Weng, Te-I', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Yang, Rong-Sen', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Wu, Mei-Hwan', 'Liu, Shing-Hwa']","['Wang CC', 'Weng TI', 'Lu MY', 'Yang RS', 'Lin KH', 'Wu MH', 'Liu SH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

These actions control early steps in T cell transformation and development of Adult T cell leukemia (ATL), an aggressive malignancy of HTLV-1 infected T lymphocytes. Post-translational modifications of Tax by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and acetylation have been implicated in Tax-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, a key function associated with Tax transforming potential. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that acetylation at lysine K(346) in the carboxy-terminal domain of Tax is modulated in the Tax nuclear bodies by the acetyltransferase p300 and the deacetylases HDAC5/7 and controls phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor pRb by Tax-cyclin D3-CDK4-p21(CIP) complexes. This property correlates with the inability of the acetylation deficient K(346)R mutant, but not the acetylation mimetic K(346)Q mutant, to promote anchorage-independent growth of Rat-1 fibroblasts. By contrast, acetylation at lysine K(346) had no effects on the ability of Tax carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding domain to interact with the tumor suppressor hDLG. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the acetyltransferase p300 and the deacetylase HDAC7 as enzymes modulating Tax acetylation points to new therapeutic targets for the treatment of HTLV-1 infected patients at risk of developing ATL.","['Lodewick, Julie', 'Sampaio, Carla', 'Boxus, Mathieu', 'Rinaldi, Anne-Sophie', 'Coulonval, Katia', 'Willems, Luc', 'Roger, Pierre P', 'Bex, Francoise']","['Lodewick J', 'Sampaio C', 'Boxus M', 'Rinaldi AS', 'Coulonval K', 'Willems L', 'Roger PP', 'Bex F']","['Institute for Microbiological Research J-M Wiame (IRMW), Laboratory of Microbiology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1, Avenue E, Gryson, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3734113,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-75 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-75 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Jul 23;10:75. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoimmune diseases predispose to lymphoid malignancies and lymphoid malignancies, conversely, can manifest as autoimmune diseases. While it has been clear for a long time that a competitive advantage and uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of both lymphoid malignancies as well as autoimmune diseases, the overlap of the underlying mechanisms has been less well described. Next generation sequencing has led to massive expansion of the available genomic data in many diseases over the last five years. These data allow for comparison of the molecular pathogenesis between autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies. Here, we review the similarities between autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies: 1) Both, autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies are characterized by activation of the same T and B cell signaling pathways, and dysregulation of these pathways can occur through genetic or epigenetic events. 2) In both scenarios, clonal and subclonal evolution of lymphocytes contribute to disease. 3) Development of both diseases not only depends on T or B cell intrinsic factors, such as germline or somatic mutations, but also on environmental factors. These include infections, the presence of other immune cells in the microenvironment, and the cytokine milieu.

Patients with advanced disease are treated at diagnosis, whereas others, regardless of their prognostic indicators, are offered treatment only at disease progression. Furthermore, treatment guidelines for elderly or ""unfit"" patients are unavailable because most CLL trials have included mostly younger, healthier patients. Given theheterogeneity of the clinical manifestations and prognosis of CLL, patients are likely to benefit from a personalized therapeutic approach. Recent advances in CLL pathobiology research, the use of high-throughput technologies, and most importantly, the introduction of novel targeted therapies with high efficacy and low toxicity are currently transforming the treatment of CLL. A personalized approach that includes early intervention in selected patients with CLL is likely to bring physicians closer to the goal of attaining cures in most patients with CLL.","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Laboratory of Nanomedicine, Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S.

Therefore, the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is a promising approach for eliminating tumors, particularly in advanced stages. A strategic medication is to use a bispecific antibody format that is capable of recruiting polyclonal T cells around antibody-target-expressing tumor cells. Recently, we have constructed a bispecific antibody, anti-CD3xanti-CD19, in a diabody configuration. In this study, we measured B7 family members B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) expressed on a CD19(+) human leukemia cell line, Nalm-6, stimulated by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). We found that a low concentration of Ara-C could upregulate CD80 expressed on CD19(+) Nalm-6 cells. The cytotoxicity of T lymphocytes against Nalm-6 cells in vitro and in vivo mediated by the anti-CD3xanti-CD19 diabody with or without a low dose of Ara-C was compared. The combination of the anti-CD3xanti-CD19 diabody and Ara-C showed the greatest effectiveness in enhancing the cytotoxicity of T cells against the tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Activated T cells expressed higher levels of CD25 and CD69 and released more interleukin 2. Both perforin/granzyme B system and Fas/FasL pathway were involved in the diabody-induced T-cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, the activated T cells could upregulate ICAM-3 expression on Nalm-6 cells, and inhibition of LFA-1-ICAM-3 interaction impaired cytotoxicity of T cells. It was noted that Ara-C could upregulate CD80 expressed on two of five specimens of acute B lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived cells. Cytotoxicity of T cells against these two patient-derived cells was enhanced in the presence of the anti-CD3xanti-CD19 diabody. These findings indicate that treatment strategy using both cytotoxic lymphocyte-based immunotherapy and chemotherapy may have synergistic effects.","['Li, Wei', 'Fan, DongMei', 'Yang, Ming', 'Yan, Yan', 'Shi, RuiZan', 'Cheng, JunPing', 'Li, ZhenZhen', 'Zhang, MengNan', 'Wang, JianXiang', 'Xiong, Dongsheng']","['Li W', 'Fan D', 'Yang M', 'Yan Y', 'Shi R', 'Cheng J', 'Li Z', 'Zhang M', 'Wang J', 'Xiong D']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, P.R.

A mimic of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSODm), synthesized by a chemical method, has been shown to possess antitumor properties. However, the anticancer activity of MnSODm in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still obscure. In this study, we investigated the effects of MnSODm on the apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells. Results showed that MnSODm significantly reduced the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. By flow cytometric analysis, we found that MnSODm treatment resulted in increased apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Further analysis demonstrated involvement of activation of the caspase cascade, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and release of cytochrome c in MnSODm-induced apoptosis. The results also showed that the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bid were dose-dependently decreased, whereas the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein was increased. Thus, MnSODm induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells via mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent pathways. MnSODm inhibition of Akt phosphorylation may contribute to MnSODm-mediated acute myeloid leukemia cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction.","['Wang, Yan-Hong', 'Xu, Xiang-Jiu', 'Zhang, Ling-Fang', 'Li, Hong-Ling']","['Wang YH', 'Xu XJ', 'Zhang LF', 'Li HL']",['Department of Pharmacy.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130912,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Molecular Mimicry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/25 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/25 06:00'],"['2013/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.825904 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 May;55(5):1166-75. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.825904.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone on the Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling during apoptotic process. We found that both tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-9/3 and Sub-G1 accumulation in K562 cells. However, they have the distinct JAK/STAT pathway, in which tanshinone IIA inhibits JAK2/STAT5 signaling, whereas cryptotanshinone targets the JAK2/STAT3. In addition, tanshinone IIA enhanced the expression of both SHP-1 and -2, while cryptotanshinone regulated the expression of only SHP-1. Both tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone attenuated the expression of bcl-xL, survivin, and cyclin D1. Furthermore, tanshinone IIA augmented synergy with imatinib, a CML chemotherapeutic drug, better than cryptotanshinone in K562 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that the anticancer activity of tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone is mediated by the distinct the JAK/STAT3/5 and SHP1/2 signaling, and tanshinone IIA has the potential for combination therapy with imatinib in K562 CML cells.","['Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Kwon, Tae-Rin', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Kim, Eun-Ok', 'Sohn, Eun Jung', 'Yun, Miyong', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Jung JH', 'Kwon TR', 'Jeong SJ', 'Kim EO', 'Sohn EJ', 'Yun M', 'Kim SH']","['College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130626,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC3710643,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2013/07/24 06:01,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/805639 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:805639. doi: 10.1155/2013/805639.

When hypothalamus-pituitary axis is exposed to radiotherapy, children's hormone level and quality of life are influenced. The aim of this study is to determine late effects of radiotherapy on hormonal level in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study 27 children with ALL, who have been referred to Shahid Ramezanzadeh Radiation Oncology Center in Yazd-Iran and received 18-24 Gy whole brain radiation with Cobalt 60 or 9 MV linear accelerator, were assessed. These patient's basic weight, height and hormonal levels were measured before radiotherapy and also after different periods of time. RESULTS: GHD (growth hormone deficiency) after clonidine stimulation test was observed in 44% (n=12) and that in 50% of them (n=6), less than 1 year, had been passed from their radiation therapy. None of these patients demonstrated hormone deficiency in other axes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that even application of a 18-24 Gy radiation dose might influence growth hormone levels; therefore, we recommend reduction of radiotherapy dose in such patients whenever possible.","['Mirouliaei, Mehrdad', 'Shabani, Masoud', 'Bakhshi, Fatemeh', 'Ordouei, Mahtab']","['Mirouliaei M', 'Shabani M', 'Bakhshi F', 'Ordouei M']","['Department of Pediatrics Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,PMC3715991,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hypopituitarism', 'radiation']",2013/07/24 06:00,2013/07/24 06:01,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.113396 [doi]', 'IJMPO-34-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2013 Jan;34(1):8-10. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.113396.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the expression of the fusion genes CBFB/MYH11 or RUNX1/RUNX1T1 alone is not sufficient to cause leukemia, we performed exome sequencing of an AML sample with an inv(16) to identify mutations, which may collaborate with the CBFB/MYH11 fusion during leukemogenesis. We discovered an N676K mutation in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding domain (tyrosine kinase domain 1 [TKD1]) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene. In a cohort of 84 de novo AML patients with a CBFB/MYH11 rearrangement and in 36 patients with a RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rearrangement, the FLT3 N676K mutation was identified in 5 and 1 patients, respectively (5 [6%] of 84; 1 [3%] of 36). The FLT3-N676K mutant alone leads to factor-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells and, together with a concurrent FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication), confers resistance to the FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PTKIs) PKC412 and AC220. Gene expression analysis of AML patients with CBFB/MYH11 rearrangement and FLT3 N676K mutation showed a trend toward a specific expression profile.

We have found that introduction of the most common NPMc+ variant into K562 and 32D cells sensitizes these cells to apoptosis induced by drugs such as bortezomib and arsenic trioxide (ATO) that induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and that cytotoxicity is prevented in the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger. The substitution of tryptophan 288 (W288) by cysteine occurs in the great majority of NPM1c+ mutations. Mutagenesis of cysteine 288 to alanine re-localizes NPMc+ from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus and attenuates the sensitivity of cells expressing this mutation to bortezomib and ATO. Primary AML cells expressing NPMc+ are also significantly more sensitive than other AML cells to apoptosis induced by both drugs at pharmacologically achievable doses. We conclude that the presence of a cysteine moiety at position 288 results in the cytoplasmic localization of NPM1c+ and the increased sensitivity to bortezomib and ATO. These data suggest that bortezomib and ATO may have increased therapeutic efficacy in NPM1c+ leukemias.","['Huang, M', 'Thomas, D', 'Li, M X', 'Feng, W', 'Chan, S M', 'Majeti, R', 'Mitchell, B S']","['Huang M', 'Thomas D', 'Li MX', 'Feng W', 'Chan SM', 'Majeti R', 'Mitchell BS']","['Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Nucleolus/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cysteine/genetics', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013222 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.222 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):1970-80. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.222.

Sp1 protein expression was significantly reduced following treatment with LBH589 in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, LBH589 upregulated the expression of p27 and p21 and downregulated the expression of cyclin D1, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin; this led to the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways through the increase of Bax expression and the decrease of Bid and Bcl-xL expression. Treatment with LBH589 also induced the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in the HN22 and HSC4 cells.

In the present study, we compared the effect of paclitaxel on two types of leukemia cells. Our results showed that paclitaxel could inhibit the proliferation of MEL and K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The mechanism of proliferative inhibition in K562 cells treated by paclitaxel was related to the cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, as well as the induction of apoptosis. By contrast, MEL cells treated by paclitaxel showed significant characteristics of necrosis, which indicated that the mode of cell death induced by paclitaxel in these two types of leukemia cells differed. Advances in research of the cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis will extend our understanding of the mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced cell death, particularly in leukemia cells. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of necrosis in MEL cells may expedite the development of improved paclitaxel-based regimens for cancer therapy.","['Xia, Rui-Long', 'Lu, Yan', 'Zhu, Li-Na', 'Zhang, Shi-Fu', 'Zhao, Fu-Kun', 'Fu, Cai-Yun']","['Xia RL', 'Lu Y', 'Zhu LN', 'Zhang SF', 'Zhao FK', 'Fu CY']","['Laboratory of Proteomics and Molecular Enzymology, School of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech Untiversity, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 10018, P.R.

The present work characterized a MDR chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, derived from K562 through a selective process using daunorubicin. This MDR cell line was shown to be resistant to vincristine, daunorubicin, and partially resistant to imatinib. It showed a slower duplication rate. Overexpression of ABCB1 and ABCC1 was observed at the protein and functional levels and the expression of CD95, a molecule related to cell death, was reduced in the MDR cell line. Conversely, no differences were observed related to the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 or p53 expression. The activation antigen CD69 was reduced in the MDR cell line and treatment with imatinib further decreased the expressed levels. Furthermore, secretion of IL-8 was diminished in the MDR cell line. When daunorubicin-selected cells were compared to another MDR cell line, Lucena 1, derived from the same parental line K562, and selected with vincristine, a different profile was observed in relation to most aspects studied. When both cell lines were silenced for ABCB1, differences in CD69 and CD95 were maintained, despite resistance reversal. These results reinforce the idea that cell lines selected in vitro may display multiple resistance strategies that may vary with the selective agent used as well as during different steps of the selection process.","['Daflon-Yunes, Nathalia', 'Pinto-Silva, Flavio Eduardo', 'Vidal, Raphael Silveira', 'Novis, Bruna Fortunato', 'Berguetti, Tandressa', 'Lopes, Raphael Rodrigues Soares', 'Polycarpo, Carla', 'Rumjanek, Vivian M']","['Daflon-Yunes N', 'Pinto-Silva FE', 'Vidal RS', 'Novis BF', 'Berguetti T', 'Lopes RR', 'Polycarpo C', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Laboratorio de Imunologia Tumoral, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Bloco H02, Sala 003, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-590, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130723,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-013-1761-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2013 Nov;383(1-2):123-35. doi: 10.1007/s11010-013-1761-0.

The patient had received nilotinib for about 3 years without significant adverse effects. She visited the clinic due to chronic cough; chest X-ray revealed consolidations in both lung fields. Nilotinib-induced ILD was diagnosed based on intensive workup, including lung biopsy. She responded dramatically to corticosteroid therapy.

In this study, two strains of ALV-J (SCAU11-H and SCAU11-XG) associated with hemangioma and myelocytoma were isolated from commercial broiler breeder animals in 2011. Their full-length proviral sequences were analyzed, revealing several unique genetic differences between the two isolates, and suggesting that the two viruses were derived from two distinct lineages. Strain SCAU11-H showed high sequence homology to early Chinese isolates associated with hemangioma, while strain SCAU11-XG was genetically closer to the prototype strain, HPRS-103. The complete genomic nucleotide sequences of SCAU11-H and SCAU11-XG were 7471 bp and 7727 bp in length, respectively. They shared 94.8% identity with each other, and had 94.0-96.8% nucleotide identity to ALV-J reference isolates. Homology analysis of the env, pol, and gag genes of the two isolates and other references strains showed that the gag and pol genes of the two viruses were more conserved than the env gene. In addition, the two isolates had significant deletions and substitutions in their 3'-UTR regions, compared to HPRS-103. These results suggest that the env gene and the 3'-UTR regions in these ALV-J isolates have evolved rapidly, and might be involved in the oncogenic spectrum of ALV-J. The results of this study contribute to our further study of the relationship between ALV integration patterns and multi-pathotypes associated with ALV-J.","['Li, Yuhao', 'Liu, Xuemei', 'Liu, Haixia', 'Xu, Chenggang', 'Liao, Yalin', 'Wu, Xiaochan', 'Cao, Weisheng', 'Liao, Ming']","['Li Y', 'Liu X', 'Liu H', 'Xu C', 'Liao Y', 'Wu X', 'Cao W', 'Liao M']","[""Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens/genetics/virology', 'China', 'Hemangioma/*veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*veterinary/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J)', 'Hemangioma', 'Myeloma', 'Phylogenetic analysis']",2013/07/24 06:00,2014/06/26 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(13)00321-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2013 Oct 25;166(3-4):356-64. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.007.

CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) had reported to participate in this process. However the roles of bone marrow microenvironment in leukemic infiltration were not well investigated. METHODS: A co-culture system between SHI-1 cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is used to simulate the interactions of leukemic cells with their microenvironment. The trans-matrigel invasion was used to detect the capability of SHI-1 cells invasion. The BMSCs and SHI-1 cells were mixed in a ratio of 1:10 and added to the millicell chamber coated with matrigel. Either the co-culture supernatant or the functional blocking peptide of CXCR4 and EMMPRIN were added to the trans-matrigel invasion system. The expressions of EMMPRIN in SHI-1 cells and BMSCs were detected by RT-PCR. The changes of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), and CXCR4 mRNA in SHI-1 cells were determined by real-time PCR. The concentration of stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in serum free supernatant was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Both SHI-1 cells and BMSCs express EMMPRIN. SHI-1 cells could hardly invade the matrigel membrane; the coculture supernatant did not induce the invasion of SHI-1 cells. When contacting directly with BMSCs, SHI-1 cells invaded to the lower chamber of millicell were significantly increased. The functional blocking peptide of CXCR4 and EMMPRIN could significantly inhibit the invasion triggered by BMSCs. When co-culturing with BMSCs, the expression of CXCR4, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 mRNA in SHI-1 cells were significantly elevated in company with a significantly higher level of SDF-1 in the co-cultured serum-free supernatant.

An additional observation is that some chromosomal changes appear early in the disease progression, and some others appear late. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On the basis of this information, a model for karyotypic evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is presented. The Mitelman Database of Chromosomes in Cancer was searched, and 1749 abnormal karyotypes were assessed. The main clones were analyzed, and chromosomal gains and losses were used to design a model of genetic acquisition based on the calculation of a variable called time to occurrence (TO). RESULTS: Our comprehensive study of genetic abnormalities in a large number of CLL karyotypes revealed that most CLL has 2 chromosomal aberrations at diagnosis. Moreover, the temporal analysis suggests that trisomy 12 is an early event in the biological evolution of CLL.

In this randomised phase II trial, we investigated whether CML patients in molecular response(4.5) (MR(4.5), quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)) after previous combination therapy with imatinib and cytarabine may discontinue imatinib treatment safely. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients from the HOVON 51 study with an MR(4.5) for at least 2 years who were still on imatinib treatment were randomised between continuation of imatinib (arm A, n=18) or discontinuation of imatinib (arm B, n=15). RESULTS: After a median follow up of 36 months since randomisation, 3 patients (17%) in arm A and 10 patients (67%) in arm B had a molecular relapse. All 3 relapsing patients in arm A had also stopped imatinib after randomisation. All but one relapsing patient relapsed within 7 months after discontinuation of imatinib. The molecular relapse rate at 12 and 24 months after randomisation was 0% and 6% (arm A) and 53% and 67% (arm B) respectively.

Moreover, the mutations of epigenetic modulator genes have been shown to be implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. The epigenetic study has initiated in the neuroscience field for a relative short period of time. In this review, we will summarize recent discoveries about epigenetic regulation on neural development, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders.

However, whether and how these particles could inhibit the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is unclear. In the present study, we prepared AgNPs with various sizes and investigated their cytotoxic effect on AML cells. We found that AgNPs could inhibit the viability of AML cells including the isolates from AML patients. AgNPs caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), losses of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA damage and apoptosis. Both vitamin C (Vit C) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could completely reverse the generation of ROS upon AgNPs, however only NAC but not Vit C could protect the cells from losses of MMP, DNA damage and apoptosis thoroughly. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with silver ions alone. As NAC was not only an antioxidant to scavenge ROS but also a silver ion chelator, these data supported the model that both generation of ROS and release of silver ions played critical roles in the AgNPs-induced cytotoxic effect against AML cells. Taken together, this work elucidated the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on AML cells and their underlying mechanism and might have significant impact on AML treatment.","['Guo, Dawei', 'Zhu, Lingying', 'Huang, Zhihai', 'Zhou, Haixia', 'Ge, Yue', 'Ma, Wenjuan', 'Wu, Jie', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Zhou, Xuefeng', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Gu, Ning']","['Guo D', 'Zhu L', 'Huang Z', 'Zhou H', 'Ge Y', 'Ma W', 'Wu J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou X', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Gu N']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ions/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Silver/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Silver ions', 'Silver nanoparticles']",2013/07/24 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(13)00797-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2013 Oct;34(32):7884-94. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.015.

Because patients treated with imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors achieve lower levels of detectable disease, quantitation of BCR-ABL1 transcripts with quantitative RT-PCR has become an essential tool in chronic myeloid leukemia monitoring. The prognostic significance of molecular responses was recently established by large-scale clinical trials. Achieving defined levels of BCR-ABL1 on the International Scale within specific time frames is an important measure for assessing patient response and probability for relapse and progression. However, extensive variation in quantitative RT-PCR procedures and reporting makes it difficult to interpret these results. More important, lack of standardization, particularly in the United States, prevents the comparison of individual patient results to the data from the clinical trials, which thereby prohibits the meaningful use of such results in the direction of patient care. In this article, we will present an overview of the clinical trial discoveries that drive the need for standardization, review the most updated monitoring guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and highlight recommendations for laboratory practice regarding internal controls and reference materials. Finally, we will provide an update on the recent efforts in the standardization of quantitative RT-PCR reporting using the International Scale.","['Zhen, ChaoJie', 'Wang, Y Lynn']","['Zhen C', 'Wang YL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130720,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genetic Testing/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Standards']",,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(13)00111-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2013 Sep;15(5):556-64. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.05.010.

DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: University hospital and research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Endometrial biopsy samples from fertile donors (n = 20), and surplus, frozen, good-quality human embryos obtained from an in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic that survived thawing (n = 51). INTERVENTION(S): Timed human endometrial biopsy on the day of luteinizing hormone peak + 4 days (LH + 4). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Human embryo attachment rate, embryo quality, and expression of AKT and caspase-3. RESULT(S): PEGLA significantly reduced the embryo attachment rate to the endometrial construct. It decreased both mRNA and protein for LIF in the endometrial construct. Inhibition of embryonic LIF triggered apoptosis. Analysis of these blastocysts by immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a down-regulation in AKT activation and an increase in caspase-3 activation compared with the control group of blastocysts. CONCLUSION(S): The LIF inhibitor PEGLA could be a potential nonsteroidal fertility-regulating agent in humans. It acts on endometrial epithelial cells by down-regulating endometrial epithelial LIF. Inhibition of blastocyst LIF decreased its cell survival factor p-AKT and increased apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3). This highlights that embryonic LIF is vital for human embryo implantation.","['Lalitkumar, Sujata', 'Boggavarapu, Nageswara R', 'Menezes, Judith', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina', 'Lalitkumar, Luther P G']","['Lalitkumar S', 'Boggavarapu NR', 'Menezes J', 'Dimitriadis E', 'Zhang JG', 'Nicola NA', 'Gemzell-Danielsson K', 'Lalitkumar LP']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (pegylated MH35-BD-Q29A+G124R protein)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biopsy', 'Blastocyst/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'LIF', 'PEGLA', 'apoptosis', 'embryo attachment']",2013/07/24 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0015-0282(13)00723-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2013 Oct;100(4):1160-9. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.023.

First, in this study, to establish a method for the expression and functional analysis of bovine PD-1, hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for bovine PD-1 were established. Treatment with these anti-PD-1 mAb enhanced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Next, to examine whether PD-1 blockade by anti-PD-1 mAb could upregulate the immune reaction during chronic infection, the expression and functional analysis of PD-1 in PBMC isolated from BLV-infected cattle with or without lymphoma were performed using anti-PD-1 mAb. The frequencies of both PD-1+ CD4+ T cells in blood and lymph node and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in lymph node were higher in BLV-infected cattle with lymphoma than those without lymphoma or control uninfected cattle. PD-1 blockade enhanced IFN-gamma production and proliferation and reduced BLV-gp51 expression and B-cell activation in PBMC from BLV-infected cattle in response to BLV-gp51 peptide mixture.

Thus, it is challenging for users to perform such analyses, highlighting the need for a single tool for such purposes. The 3Omics one-click web tool was developed to visualize and rapidly integrate multiple human inter- or intra-transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data by combining five commonly used analyses: correlation networking, coexpression, phenotyping, pathway enrichment, and GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment. RESULTS: 3Omics generates inter-omic correlation networks to visualize relationships in data with respect to time or experimental conditions for all transcripts, proteins and metabolites. If only two of three omics datasets are input, then 3Omics supplements the missing transcript, protein or metabolite information related to the input data by text-mining the PubMed database. 3Omics' coexpression analysis assists in revealing functions shared among different omics datasets. 3Omics' phenotype analysis integrates Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with available transcript or protein data. Pathway enrichment analysis on metabolomics data by 3Omics reveals enriched pathways in the KEGG/HumanCyc database. 3Omics performs statistical Gene Ontology-based functional enrichment analyses to display significantly overrepresented GO terms in transcriptomic experiments. Although the principal application of 3Omics is the integration of multiple omics datasets, it is also capable of analyzing individual omics datasets. The information obtained from the analyses of 3Omics in Case Studies 1 and 2 are also in accordance with comprehensive findings in the literature.

Among their target proteins, liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and beta modulate the cell cycle in a large range of cancer cell lines. Besides their role as cholesterol sensors, LXRs are also involved in the proliferation/apoptosis balance regulation in various types of cancers. AREAS COVERED: This review covers oxysterols and derivatives of cholesterol as well as synthetic or natural ligands (agonist/antagonist) of LXRs. Most tumor cell lines are sensitive to LXR activation. Indeed various cancers are concerned such as prostate, breast, glioblastoma, colorectal, and ovary tumors, and leukemia. EXPERT OPINION: Developing the use of LXR ligands in human health, especially in the field of cancer, represents a novel and promising strategy. Despite a wide spectrum of applications, numerous adverse effects of LXR activation need to be solved before genuine clinical trials in humans. Future directions will be based on the engineering of selective LXRs modulators (SLiMs) as already done for nuclear steroid receptors.","['De Boussac, Hugues', 'Alioui, Anthony', 'Viennois, Emilie', 'Dufour, Julie', 'Trousson, Amalia', 'Vega, Aurelie', 'Guy, Laurent', 'Volle, David H', 'Lobaccaro, Jean-Marc A', 'Baron, Silvere']","['De Boussac H', 'Alioui A', 'Viennois E', 'Dufour J', 'Trousson A', 'Vega A', 'Guy L', 'Volle DH', 'Lobaccaro JM', 'Baron S']","['Clermont Universite, Universite Blaise Pascal, Genetique Reproduction et Developpement, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130722,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Liver X Receptors)', '0 (Orphan Nuclear Receptors)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Liver X Receptors', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors/*metabolism']",,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2013.820708 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2013 Sep;17(9):1029-38. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2013.820708.

Prior to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), HHT was the most active therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after interferon failure. Subsequent trials showed that HHT and omacetaxine are active in patients failing several TKIs or carrying the T315I mutation. AREAS COVERED: This review will discuss the preclinical development of HHT and omacetaxine mepesuccinate in CML and the clinical studies leading to its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). EXPERT OPINION: A sizable number of patients with CML will develop TKI resistance, frequently through the acquisition of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations. Omacetaxine is active in patients with CML after failure to multiple TKIs and in those carrying the T315I mutation, which is highly resistant to all FDA-approved TKIs except for ponatinib. Both ponatinib and omacetaxine have been recently approved by the FDA and represent useful treatment options for patients with CML who failed several TKIs and/or acquired the T315I mutation. The development of an oral formulation of omacetaxine would greatly facilitate its use and provide an attractive option for TKI-based combinatorial strategies.","['Nazha, Aziz', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso']","['Nazha A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J', 'Quintas-Cardama A']","['The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia Unit , 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 , USA +1 713 745 4009 ; aquintas@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130723,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy']",,,,2013/07/24 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/07/24 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2013.821464 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2013 Oct;14(14):1977-86. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2013.821464.

Furthermore, pediatric Down syndrome (DS) patients with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL), whose blast cells almost universally harbor somatic mutations in exon 2 of the transcription factor gene GATA1, demonstrate increased overall survival relative to non-DS pediatric patients, suggesting a potential role for GATA1 in chemotherapy response. In this study, we confirmed that amongst non-DS patients, GATA1 transcripts were significantly higher in AMKL blasts compared to blasts from other AML subgroups. Further, GATA1 transcript levels significantly correlated with transcript levels for the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in our patient cohort. ShRNA knockdown of GATA1 in the megakaryocytic cell line Meg-01 resulted in significantly increased cytarabine (ara-C) and daunorubicin anti-proliferative sensitivities and decreased Bcl-xL transcript and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter gene assays demonstrated that the Bcl-x gene (which transcribes the Bcl-xL transcripts) is a bona fide GATA1 target gene in AMKL cells. Treatment of the Meg-01 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid resulted in down-regulation of both GATA1 and Bcl-xL and significantly enhanced ara-C sensitivity. Furthermore, additional GATA1 target genes were identified by oligonucleotide microarray and ChIP-on-Chip analyses. Our findings demonstrate a role for GATA1 in chemotherapy resistance in non-DS AMKL cells, and identified additional GATA1 target genes for future studies.","['Caldwell, John Timothy', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Dombkowski, Alan A', 'Buck, Steven A', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Caldwell JT', 'Edwards H', 'Dombkowski AA', 'Buck SA', 'Matherly LH', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW']","['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130710,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",PMC3707876,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0068601 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00477 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 10;8(7):e68601. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0068601.

Ikaros has been established as one of the most clinically relevant tumor suppressors in several hematological malignancies. In fact, expression of dominant negative Ikaros isoforms is associated with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and adult and juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia. Here, we report the isolation of a novel, non-canonical Ikaros splice variant, called Ikaros 11 (Ik11). Ik11 is structurally related to known dominant negative Ikaros isoforms, due to the lack of a functional DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, Ik11 is the first Ikaros splice variant missing the transcriptional activation domain. Indeed, we demonstrated that Ik11 works as a dominant negative protein, being able to dimerize with Ikaros DNA-binding isoforms and inhibit their functions, at least in part by retaining them in the cytoplasm. Notably, we demonstrated that Ik11 is the first dominant negative Ikaros isoform to be aberrantly expressed in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Aberrant expression of Ik11 interferes with both proliferation and apoptotic pathways, providing a mechanism for Ik11 involvement in tumor pathogenesis. Thus, Ik11 could represent a novel marker for B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Capece, Daria', 'Zazzeroni, Francesca', 'Mancarelli, Maria Michela', 'Verzella, Daniela', 'Fischietti, Mariafausta', 'Di Tommaso, Ambra', 'Maccarone, Rita', 'Plebani, Sara', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Alesse, Edoardo']","['Capece D', 'Zazzeroni F', 'Mancarelli MM', 'Verzella D', 'Fischietti M', 'Di Tommaso A', 'Maccarone R', 'Plebani S', 'Di Ianni M', 'Gulino A', 'Alesse E']","[""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA Isoforms)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Isoforms', 'Sequence Alignment']",PMC3706598,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0068080 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-03724 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 9;8(7):e68080. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0068080.

Up to now these effects were mainly attributed to its classical role as COX-inhibitor. Here we show novel COX-independent effects of diclofenac. Diclofenac significantly diminished MYC expression and modulated glucose metabolism resulting in impaired melanoma, leukemia, and carcinoma cell line proliferation in vitro and reduced melanoma growth in vivo. In contrast, the non-selective COX inhibitor aspirin and the COX-2 specific inhibitor NS-398 had no effect on MYC expression and glucose metabolism. Diclofenac significantly decreased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) gene expression in line with a decrease in glucose uptake and lactate secretion. A significant intracellular accumulation of lactate by diclofenac preceded the observed effect on gene expression, suggesting a direct inhibitory effect of diclofenac on lactate efflux. While intracellular lactate accumulation impairs cellular proliferation and gene expression, it does not inhibit MYC expression as evidenced by the lack of MYC regulation by the MCT inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Finally, in a cell line with a tetracycline-regulated c-MYC gene, diclofenac decreased proliferation both in the presence and absence of c-MYC. Thus, diclofenac targets tumor cell proliferation via two mechanisms, that is inhibition of MYC and lactate transport. Based on these results, diclofenac holds potential as a clinically applicable MYC and glycolysis inhibitor supporting established tumor therapies.","['Gottfried, Eva', 'Lang, Sven A', 'Renner, Kathrin', 'Bosserhoff, Anja', 'Gronwald, Wolfram', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Einhell, Sabine', 'Gedig, Isabel', 'Singer, Katrin', 'Seilbeck, Anton', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Grauer, Oliver', 'Hau, Peter', 'Dettmer, Katja', 'Andreesen, Reinhard', 'Oefner, Peter J', 'Kreutz, Marina']","['Gottfried E', 'Lang SA', 'Renner K', 'Bosserhoff A', 'Gronwald W', 'Rehli M', 'Einhell S', 'Gedig I', 'Singer K', 'Seilbeck A', 'Mackensen A', 'Grauer O', 'Hau P', 'Dettmer K', 'Andreesen R', 'Oefner PJ', 'Kreutz M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diclofenac/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*drug effects', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",PMC3706586,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066987 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38508 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 9;8(7):e66987. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066987.

CD20 exists as homo-oligomers in the plasma membrane, however different MS4A proteins expressed in the same cell may hetero-oligomerize. Given the importance of CD20 in B-cell function and as a therapeutic target, we sought to explore the potential for CD20 hetero-oligomerization with other MS4A proteins. We investigated expression in primary human B-cells of the four MS4A genes previously shown to be expressed in human B-cell lines (MS4A4A, MS4A6A, MS4A7, MS4A8B), as well as two genes comprising the closely related TMEM176 gene family, with a view to identifying candidates for future investigation at the protein level. TMEM176A and TMEM176B transcripts were either not detected, or were detected at relatively low levels in a minority of donor B-cell samples. MS4A4A and MS4A8B transcripts were not detected in any normal B-cell sample. MS4A6A and MS4A7 transcripts were detected at low levels in most samples, however the corresponding proteins were not at the plasma membrane when expressed as GFP conjugates in BJAB cells. We also examined expression of these genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and found that it was similar to normal B-cells with two exceptions. First, whereas MS4A4A expression was undetected in normal B-cells, it was expressed in 1/14 CLL samples. Second, compared to expression levels in normal B-cells, MS4A6A transcripts were elevated in 4/14 CLL samples. In summary, none of the MS4A/TMEM176 genes tested was expressed at high levels in normal or in most CLL B-cells. MS4A6A and MS4A7 were expressed at low levels in most B-cell samples, however the corresponding proteins may not be positioned at the plasma membrane. Altogether, these data suggest that CD20 normally does not form hetero-oligomers with other MS4A proteins and that there are unlikely to be other MS4A proteins in CLL that might provide useful alternate therapeutic targets.","['Zuccolo, Jonathan', 'Deng, Lili', 'Unruh, Tammy L', 'Sanyal, Ratna', 'Bau, Jeremy A', 'Storek, Jan', 'Demetrick, Douglas J', 'Luider, Joanne M', 'Auer-Grzesiak, Iwona A', 'Mansoor, Adnan', 'Deans, Julie P']","['Zuccolo J', 'Deng L', 'Unruh TL', 'Sanyal R', 'Bau JA', 'Storek J', 'Demetrick DJ', 'Luider JM', 'Auer-Grzesiak IA', 'Mansoor A', 'Deans JP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary , Calgary, AB , Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130715,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC3711070,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'CD20', 'CLL', 'MS4A', 'TMEM176']",2013/07/23 06:00,2013/07/23 06:01,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2013.00195 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2013 Jul 15;4:195. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00195. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to the metabolism of the nucleoside analogue AraC, the backbone in AML treatment, might affect drug sensitivity and treatment outcome. Therefore, SNPs may serve as prognostic biomarkers aiding clinicians in individualized treatment decisions, with the aim of improving patient outcomes. We analyzed polymorphisms in genes encoding cytidine deaminase (CDA 79A>C rs2072671 and -451C>T rs532545), 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II 7A>G rs10883841), and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK 3'UTR 948T>C rs4643786) in 205 de novo NK-AML patients. In FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive patients, the CDA 79C/C and -451T/T genotypes were associated with shorter overall survival compared to other genotypes (5 vs. 24 months, P < 0.001 and 5 vs. 23 months, P = 0.015, respectively), and this was most pronounced in FLT3-ITD-positive/NPM1-positive patients. We observed altered in vitro sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitory drugs, but not to nucleoside analogues, and a decrease in global DNA methylation in cells carrying both CDA variant alleles. A shorter survival was also observed for the cN-II variant allele, but only in FLT3-ITD-negative patients (25 vs. 31 months, P = 0.075). Our results indicate that polymorphisms in genes related to nucleoside analog drug metabolism may serve as prognostic markers in de novo NK-AML.","['Falk, Ingrid Jakobsen', 'Fyrberg, Anna', 'Paul, Esbjorn', 'Nahi, Hareth', 'Hermanson, Monica', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Stockelberg, Dick', 'Wei, Yuan', 'Green, Henrik', 'Lotfi, Kourosh']","['Falk IJ', 'Fyrberg A', 'Paul E', 'Nahi H', 'Hermanson M', 'Rosenquist R', 'Hoglund M', 'Palmqvist L', 'Stockelberg D', 'Wei Y', 'Green H', 'Lotfi K']","['Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130909,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*genetics"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23549 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Dec;88(12):1001-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23549.

However, the genetic molecular mechanisms underlying its aberrant expression in cancer cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that BMI1 is recurrently targeted by chromosomal aberrations in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma. We identified a novel t(10;14)(p12;q32)/IGH-BMI1 rearrangement and its IGL variant in six cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and found that these aberrations were consistently acquired at time of disease progression and high grade transformation of leukemia (Richter syndrome). The IG-BMI1 translocations were not associated with any particular molecular subtype of CLL and the leukemias were negative for common mutations of NOTCH1 and TP53, known to increase a risk of progression and transformation in CLL. In addition, using FISH and SNP array analysis, we identified a wide range of BMI1-involving 10p12 lesions in 17 cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). These aberrations included various balanced and unbalanced structural abnormalities and very frequently but not exclusively, were associated with gain of the BMI1 locus and loss of the 10p terminal sequences. These findings point to genomic instability at the 10p region in MCL which likely promotes rearrangements and deregulation of BMI1. Our findings are in line with previously published observations correlating overexpression of BMI1 with tumor progression and chemoresistance. In summary, our study provides new insights into genetic molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant expression of BMI1 in lymphoma and documents its contribution in the pathogenesis of Richter syndrome and MCL.","['Rouhigharabaei, Leila', 'Ferreiro, Julio Finalet', 'Put, Natalie', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Tousseyn, Thomas', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Gardiner, Anne', 'De Kelver, Wim', 'Demuynck, Hilde', 'Verschuere, Johan', 'Theate, Ivan', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Cools, Jan', 'Wlodarska, Iwona']","['Rouhigharabaei L', 'Ferreiro JF', 'Put N', 'Michaux L', 'Tousseyn T', 'Lefebvre C', 'Gardiner A', 'De Kelver W', 'Demuynck H', 'Verschuere J', 'Theate I', 'Vicente C', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Cools J', 'Wlodarska I']","['Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allelic Imbalance', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22088 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Oct;52(10):928-44. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22088.

Previous results showed that anoplin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity but little hemolytic activity. In this study, we synthesized anoplin, studied its cytotoxicity in Friend virus-induced leukemia cells [murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells], and proposed its possible mechanism. Our results showed that anoplin could inhibit the proliferation of MEL cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner via disrupting the integrity of cell membrane, which indicated that anoplin exerts its cytotoxicity efficacy. In addition, the cell cycle distribution of MEL cells was arrested in the G(0)/G(1) phase significantly. However, anoplin could not induce obvious apoptosis in MEL cells, as well as anoplin could not induce visible changes on morphology and quantity in the bone marrow cells isolated from normal mice. All of these results indicate that anoplin, as generally believed, is a selective AMP, a value characteristic in the design of safe therapeutic agents. The cytotoxicity of anoplin on MEL cells was mainly attributable to the plasma membrane perturbation and also to the intracellular events such as the arrest of cell cycle. Although this is an initial study that explored the activity of anoplin in vitro rather than in vivo, with the increasing resistance of conventional chemotherapy, there is no doubt that anoplin has desirable feature to be developed as a novel and selective anticancer agent.","['Zhu, Li-Na', 'Fu, Cai-Yun', 'Zhang, Shi-Fu', 'Chen, Wei', 'Jin, Yuan-Ting', 'Zhao, Fu-Kun']","['Zhu LN', 'Fu CY', 'Zhang SF', 'Chen W', 'Jin YT', 'Zhao FK']","['Lab of Proteomics & Molecular Enzymology, School of Life Sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130721,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '0 (anoplin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Wasp Venoms/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Friend virus-induced leukemia cells', 'anoplin', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle distribution', 'plasma membrane perturbation']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.2533 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2013 Sep;19(9):566-74. doi: 10.1002/psc.2533.

Mice treated with LM showed reduced clinical signs of disease and mortality when compared with untreated mice. LM-treated mice had reduced tissue injury, less bacterial translocation, and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)).

Normal and pathological responses of these cells require adaptation to signaling stress through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex. Adapted cells activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), via S2448 phosphorylation, which induces de novo translation of vital signaling proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this signaling dogma remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that inactivation of HIF-1, by silencing its inducible alpha subunit, significantly decreases mTOR S2448 phosphorylation caused by ligand-dependent activation of human myeloid leukemia cells. This shows that HIF-1 is essential for the activation of mTOR and serves at a crucial juncture of myeloid cell function in both in vitro and in vivo systems.","['Yasinska, Inna M', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Lall, Gurprit S', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Yasinska IM', 'Gibbs BF', 'Lall GS', 'Sumbayev VV']","['Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Anson Building, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent, ME4 4TB, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130720,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tlr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-013-1421-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2014 Feb;71(4):699-710. doi: 10.1007/s00018-013-1421-2.

SAMHD1 mutations cause autoimmune Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and are found in cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. SAMHD1 is a triphosphohydrolase that depletes the cellular pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, thereby preventing reverse transcription of retroviral genomes. However, in vivo evidence for SAMHD1's antiviral activity has been lacking. We generated Samhd1 null mice that do not develop autoimmune disease despite displaying a type I interferon signature in spleen, macrophages and fibroblasts. Samhd1(-/-) cells have elevated deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) levels but, surprisingly, SAMHD1 deficiency did not lead to increased infection with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 vectors. The lack of restriction is likely attributable to the fact that dNTP concentrations in SAMHD1-sufficient mouse cells are higher than the KM of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Consistent with this notion, an HIV-1 vector mutant bearing an RT with lower affinity for dNTPs was sensitive to SAMHD1-dependent restriction in cultured cells and in mice. This shows that SAMHD1 can restrict lentiviruses in vivo and that nucleotide starvation is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism.","['Rehwinkel, Jan', 'Maelfait, Jonathan', 'Bridgeman, Anne', 'Rigby, Rachel', 'Hayward, Bruce', 'Liberatore, Rachel A', 'Bieniasz, Paul D', 'Towers, Greg J', 'Moita, Luis F', 'Crow, Yanick J', 'Bonthron, David T', 'Reis e Sousa, Caetano']","['Rehwinkel J', 'Maelfait J', 'Bridgeman A', 'Rigby R', 'Hayward B', 'Liberatore RA', 'Bieniasz PD', 'Towers GJ', 'Moita LF', 'Crow YJ', 'Bonthron DT', 'Reis e Sousa C']","['1] Immunobiology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, UK [2] Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (Samhd1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HIV Infections/genetics/*physiopathology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology/*physiology', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nervous System Malformations/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcription/genetics/*physiology', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1']",PMC3770946,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2013163 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2013.163 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2013 Sep 11;32(18):2454-62. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2013.163.

The fate of infected macrophages plays a key role in determining the outcome of the host immune response. Apoptotic cell death of macrophages is considered to be a protective host defense that eliminates pathogens and infected cells. In this study, we investigated the involvement of Notch signaling in regulating apoptosis in macrophages treated with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD). Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) treated with PPD or infected with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) induced upregulation of Notch1. This upregulation correlated well with the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene mcl-1 both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Decreased levels of Notch1 and Mcl-1 were observed in BMM treated with PPD when a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), which inhibits the processing of Notch receptors, was used. Moreover, silencing Notch1 in the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 decreased Mcl-1 protein expression, suggesting that Notch1 is critical for Mcl-1 expression in macrophages. A significant increase in apoptotic cells was observed upon treatment of BMM with PPD in the presence of GSI compared to the vehicle-control treated cells. Finally, analysis of the mcl-1 promoter in humans and mice revealed a conserved potential CSL/RBP-Jkappa binding site. The association of Notch1 with the mcl-1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Taken together, these results indicate that Notch1 inhibits apoptosis of macrophages stimulated with PPD by directly controlling the mcl-1 promoter.","['Palaga, Tanapat', 'Ratanabunyong, Siriluk', 'Pattarakankul, Thitiporn', 'Sangphech, Naunpun', 'Wongchana, Wipawee', 'Hadae, Yukihiro', 'Kueanjinda, Patipark']","['Palaga T', 'Ratanabunyong S', 'Pattarakankul T', 'Sangphech N', 'Wongchana W', 'Hadae Y', 'Kueanjinda P']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. tanapat.p@chula.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130722,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Tuberculin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology/microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tuberculin/pharmacology']",PMC4003195,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/03/08 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['cmi201322 [pii]', '10.1038/cmi.2013.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2013 Sep;10(5):444-52. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2013.22.

We survey recent literature and provide some insights into these studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent case reports highlight emerging new causes of oculomotor cranial nerve palsies, including sellar chordoma, odontogenic abscess, nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, polycythemia, sphenoiditis, neurobrucellosis, interpeduncular fossa lipoma, metastatic pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. Surgical studies have focused on modifications and innovations regarding strabismus surgery for this condition. New globe fixation procedures may include fixation to the medial orbital wall by precaruncular and retrocaruncular approaches, apically based orbital bone periosteal flap fixation and the suture/T-plate anchoring platform system. SUMMARY: Management of oculomotor nerve palsy depends in part upon the underlying cause and anatomical location of the lesion. Careful clinical evaluation and appropriate imaging can identify a definitive cause in most cases. Surgical options depend on the number, extent, and severity of the muscles involved as well as the presence or absence of signs of aberrant regeneration. The clinician should also address issues that arise due to involvement of the pupil and accommodation. Strabismus surgery can be challenging but also rewarding with appropriate selection and staging of procedures.","['Sadagopan, Karthikeyan A', 'Wasserman, Barry N']","['Sadagopan KA', 'Wasserman BN']","['Pediatric Ophthalmology and Ocular Genetics, Aravind Eye Care System, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Current opinion in ophthalmology,9011108,,IM,"['*Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological', 'Humans', 'Oculomotor Nerve Diseases/*diagnosis/*surgery', '*Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures', 'Strabismus/diagnosis/surgery']",,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/ICU.0b013e3283645a9b [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2013 Sep;24(5):438-47. doi: 10.1097/ICU.0b013e3283645a9b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further understand how Hoxb8 contributes to myeloid cell immortalisation, we generated IL-3-dependant myeloid cells expressing Hoxb8 under the control of an inducible promoter. Downregulation of Hoxb8, in the presence of IL-3, caused cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in the majority of cells. Apoptosis was dependant on Bax and Bak and, in part, on Bim, which was repressed by Hoxb8. Deletion of the miR-17 approximately 92 seed sequences in the Bim 3'UTR abolished Hoxb8-dependant regulation of Bim reporter constructs. Expression of all six miRNAs from this cluster were elevated when Hoxb8 was overexpressed. The miR-17 approximately 92 cluster was required for repression of Bim in Hoxb8-immortalised cells and deletion of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster substantially inhibited Hoxb8, but not Hoxa9, mediated survival and proliferation. Hoxb8 appears to promote miR-17 approximately 92 expression through c-Myc, a known transcriptional regulator of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster.

Alterations of these proteins may cause resistance to chemotherapy-induced cell death and immune responses. By serendipity we cloned a variant of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-family member Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl1) from human neuroblastoma and leukemia cells. This Mcl1L variant lacks a 45 bp sequence that codes for 15 highly conserved amino acids ranging from Gly158 to Asp172. This region is part of the so called PEST-sequence of Mcl1L and contains two phosphorylation sites (Ser159 and Thr163) that regulate Mcl1L stability. A caspase 3/caspase 8 cleavage site at Asp157 which has been reported to be critical for death-receptor-induced apoptosis and for the conversion of Mcl1L into a pro-apoptotic protein is also missing in this novel variant.

Hence, there is much interest in targeted therapies that block eIF4F activity to assess the consequences on tumor cell growth and chemotherapy response. We report here that hippuristanol (Hipp), a translation initiation inhibitor that selectively inhibits the eIF4F RNA helicase subunit, eIF4A, resensitizes Emu-Myc lymphomas to DNA damaging agents, including those that overexpress eIF4E-a modifier of rapamycin responsiveness. As Mcl-1 levels are significantly affected by Hipp, combining its use with the Bcl-2 family inhibitor, ABT-737, leads to a potent synergistic response in triggering cell death in mouse and human lymphoma and leukemia cells. Suppression of eIF4AI using RNA interference also synergized with ABT-737 in murine lymphomas, highlighting eIF4AI as a therapeutic target for modulating tumor cell response to chemotherapy.","['Cencic, R', 'Robert, F', 'Galicia-Vazquez, G', 'Malina, A', 'Ravindar, K', 'Somaiah, R', 'Pierre, P', 'Tanaka, J', 'Deslongchamps, P', 'Pelletier, J']","['Cencic R', 'Robert F', 'Galicia-Vazquez G', 'Malina A', 'Ravindar K', 'Somaiah R', 'Pierre P', 'Tanaka J', 'Deslongchamps P', 'Pelletier J']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130719,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3730203,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/07/23 06:01,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201325 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.25 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Jul 19;3:e128. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We addressed the cytotoxic effect of JQ1, a highly selective inhibitor against the transcriptional regulators, bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, in paediatric ALL. We showed a potent in vitro cytotoxic response of a panel of primary ALL to JQ1, independent of their prognostic features but dependent on high MYC expression and coupled with transcriptional downregulation of multiple pro-survival pathways. In agreement with earlier studies, JQ1 induced cell cycle arrest. Here we show that BET inhibition also reduced c-Myc protein stability and suppressed progression of DNA replication forks in ALL cells. Consistent with c-Myc depletion and downregulation of pro-survival pathways JQ1 sensitised primary ALL samples to the classic ALL therapeutic agent dexamethasone. Finally, we demonstrated that JQ1 reduces ALL growth in ALL xenograft models, both as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone. We conclude that targeting BET proteins should be considered as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of paediatric ALL and particularly those cases that exhibit suboptimal responses to standard treatment.","['Da Costa, D', 'Agathanggelou, A', 'Perry, T', 'Weston, V', 'Petermann, E', 'Zlatanou, A', 'Oldreive, C', 'Wei, W', 'Stewart, G', 'Longman, J', 'Smith, E', 'Kearns, P', 'Knapp, S', 'Stankovic, T']","['Da Costa D', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Perry T', 'Weston V', 'Petermann E', 'Zlatanou A', 'Oldreive C', 'Wei W', 'Stewart G', 'Longman J', 'Smith E', 'Kearns P', 'Knapp S', 'Stankovic T']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130719,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3730202,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/07/23 06:01,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201324 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.24 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Jul 19;3:e126. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.24.,"['092809/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '13030/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with late-stage tumors. Moreover, pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is closely related to high levels of pro-survival mediators, which can ultimately lead to rapid disease progression, resistance and metastasis. The main goal of this study was to define the mechanisms by which calix[6]arene, but not other calixarenes, efficiently decreases the aggressiveness of a drug resistant human pancreas carcinoma cell line (Panc-1). Calix[6]arene was more potent in reducing Panc-1 cell viability than gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. In relation to the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxic effects, it led to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase through downregulation of PIM1, CDK2, CDK4 and retinoblastoma proteins. Importantly, calix[6]arene abolished signal transduction of Mer and AXL tyrosine kinase receptors, both of which are usually overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K and mTOR was also observed, and these proteins are positively modulated by Mer and AXL. Despite decreasing the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308, calix[6]arene caused an increase in phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings in conjunction with increased BiP and IRE1-alpha provide a molecular basis explaining the capacity of calix[6]arene to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagic cell death. Our findings highlight calix[6]arene as a potential candidate for overcoming pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. Importantly, we provide evidence that calix[6]arene affects a broad array of key targets that are usually dysfunctional in pancreatic cancer, a highly desirable characteristic for chemotherapeutics.","['Pelizzaro-Rocha, Karin Juliane', 'de Jesus, Marcelo Bispo', 'Ruela-de-Sousa, Roberta Regina', 'Nakamura, Celso Vataru', 'Reis, Fabiano Souza', 'de Fatima, Angelo', 'Ferreira-Halder, Carmen Verissima']","['Pelizzaro-Rocha KJ', 'de Jesus MB', 'Ruela-de-Sousa RR', 'Nakamura CV', 'Reis FS', 'de Fatima A', 'Ferreira-Halder CV']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biology Institute, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biology Institute, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biology Institute, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Basic Health Sciences, State University of Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biology Institute, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Acquired STAT3 mutations have been recently identified in 40% of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, a rare T-cell disorder. In this study, we investigated the mutational status of STAT3 in a large series of patients with lymphoid and myeloid diseases. STAT3 mutations were identified in 1.6% (4 of 258) of patients with T-cell neoplasms, in 2.5% (2 of 79) of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma but in no other B-cell lymphoma patients (0 of 104) or patients with myeloid malignancies (0 of 96). Functional in vitro assays indicated that the STAT3Y640F mutation leads to a constitutive phosphorylation of the protein. STA21, a STAT3 small molecule inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of two distinct STAT3 mutated cell lines. Using a mouse bone marrow transplantation assay, we observed that STAT3Y640F expression leads to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms with expansion of either myeloid cells or megakaryocytes. Together, these data indicate that the STAT3Y640F mutation leads to constitutive activation of STAT3, induces malignant hematopoiesis in vivo, and may represent a novel therapeutic target in some lymphoid malignancies.","['Couronne, Lucile', 'Scourzic, Laurianne', 'Pilati, Camilla', 'Della Valle, Veronique', 'Duffourd, Yannis', 'Solary, Eric', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Merlio, Jean-Philippe', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Stern, Marc-Henri', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Lamant, Laurence', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Tilly, Herve', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Zucman-Rossi, Jessica', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Mercher, Thomas']","['Couronne L', 'Scourzic L', 'Pilati C', 'Della Valle V', 'Duffourd Y', 'Solary E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Merlio JP', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Damm F', 'Stern MH', 'Gaulard P', 'Lamant L', 'Delabesse E', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Fontenay M', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C', 'Zucman-Rossi J', 'Bernard OA', 'Mercher T']",['thomas.mercher@inserm.fr.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics']",PMC3815176,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.085068 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.085068 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Nov;98(11):1748-52. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.085068.

In this work, we identify and validate the SRC family kinase LCK as a protein whose activity is absolutely required for the proliferation and survival of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells that depend on NUP214-ABL1 activity. These findings underscore the potential of SRC kinase inhibitors and of the dual ABL1/SRC kinase inhibitors dasatinib and bosutinib for the treatment of NUP214-ABL1-positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, we used mass spectrometry to identify protein interaction partners of NUP214-ABL1. Our results strongly support that the signaling network of NUP214-ABL1 is distinct from that previously reported for BCR-ABL1.

The current study has been initiated to determine whether the flavonoid wogonin can attenuate etoposide-induced oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in mouse bone marrow cells. We found that oral administration of wogonin before etoposide injection significantly attenuates etoposide-induced oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Etoposide induced a significant down-regulation of mRNA expression of the OGG1 repair gene and marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative DNA stress, including increased 8-OHdG, enhanced lipid peroxidation and reduction in reduced glutathione. Prior administration of wogonin ahead of etoposide challenge restored these altered parameters. Importantly, wogonin had no antagonizing effect on etoposide-induce topoisomerase-II inhibition. Conclusively, our study indicates that wogonin has a protective role in the abatement of etoposide-induced oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells of mice via suppression of oxidative DNA stress and enhancing DNA repair through modulation of OGG1 repair gene expression. Therefore, wogonin can be a promising chemoprotective agent and might be useful to avert secondary leukemia and other drug-related cancers in cured cancer patients and medical personnel exposing to the potent carcinogen etoposide.","['Attia, Sabry M', 'Ahmad, Sheikh Fayaz', 'Harisa, Gamaleldin I', 'Mansour, Ahmed M', 'El Sayed, El Sayed M', 'Bakheet, Saleh A']","['Attia SM', 'Ahmad SF', 'Harisa GI', 'Mansour AM', 'El Sayed el SM', 'Bakheet SA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. attiasm@ksu.edu.sa']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Ogg1 protein, mouse)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Glycosylases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavanones/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'DNA damage/repair', 'Oxidative DNA stress', 'Secondary tumors']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(13)00477-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2013 Sep;59:724-30. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.022.

Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, and this is accompanied by an increase in cell-substratum adhesion and cell spreading. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between cell spreading and mESC differentiation. Using E14 and R1 mESC lines, we have restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biomaterial substrates, or by manipulating the cytoskeleton. We demonstrate that by restricting the degree of spreading by either method, mESCs can be maintained in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state. Under these conditions, self-renewal occurs without the need for LIF and is independent of nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 or beta-catenin, which have previously been implicated in self-renewal. We also demonstrate that the effect of restricted cell spreading on mESC self-renewal is not mediated by increased intercellular adhesion, as evidenced by the observations that inhibition of mESC adhesion using a function blocking anti E-cadherin antibody or siRNA do not promote differentiation. These results show that mESC spreading and differentiation are regulated both by LIF and by cell-substratum adhesion, consistent with the hypothesis that cell spreading is the common intermediate step in the regulation of mESC differentiation by either LIF or cell-substratum adhesion.","['Murray, Patricia', 'Prewitz, Marina', 'Hopp, Isabel', 'Wells, Nicola', 'Zhang, Haifei', 'Cooper, Andrew', 'Parry, Kristina L', 'Short, Robert', 'Antoine, Daniel J', 'Edgar, David']","['Murray P', 'Prewitz M', 'Hopp I', 'Wells N', 'Zhang H', 'Cooper A', 'Parry KL', 'Short R', 'Antoine DJ', 'Edgar D']","['Institute of Translational Medicine, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.

It is known that HGV/GBV-C is not primary hepatotropic and its replication was reported in PBMC, bone marrow and other tissues. To investigate a possible role of HGV/GBV-C 115 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies were analyzed for virus RNA presence and quasispecies composition in three compartments: serum, PBMC and bone marrow. METHODS: RT-PCR was used to amplify 5'UTR HGV/GBV-C in serum, PBMC and bone marrow. Viral sequences obtained from three compartments were subjected for comparative molecular analysis performed by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and pyrosequencing. RESULTS: HGV/GBV-C RNA was detected in 23 out of 115 (20.0%) patients, most often in bone marrow (18 patients), followed by PBMC (11 patients) and serum (10 patients). Differences in SSCP bands distribution corresponding to different viral variants and confirmed by direct sequencing were observed in three patients. CONCLUSION: HGV/GBV-C infection is frequent in patients with hematological malignancies. Common detection of HGV/GBV-C in bone marrow supports the hypothesis that it is a major replication site of this virus.","['Kisiel, Elzbieta', 'Cortez, Kamila Caraballo', 'Pawelczyk, Agnieszka', 'Osko, Iwona Bukowska', 'Kubisa, Natalia', 'Laskus, Tomasz', 'Radkowski, Marek']","['Kisiel E', 'Cortez KC', 'Pawelczyk A', 'Osko IB', 'Kubisa N', 'Laskus T', 'Radkowski M']","['Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,Netherlands,Infect Genet Evol,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",101084138,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Flaviviridae Infections/complications/*virology', 'GB virus C/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Viral/*blood/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Compartmentalization', 'HGV/GBV-C', 'Quasispecies']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-1348(13)00275-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.meegid.2013.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Genet Evol. 2013 Oct;19:195-9. doi: 10.1016/j.meegid.2013.07.010.

METHODS: A systematic search strategy was developed comprising of two search strings: i) acute leukaemia and ii) qualitative methodology. The search strategy was run in seven electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE, BNI & Archive, SSCI and ASSIA). Nine qualitative studies in adult patients with acute leukaemia, published in peer reviewed journals between 01/1990 and 01/2013 were included in the final sample. RESULTS: The qualitative thematic synthesis resulted in the development of a conceptual model describing a person's path to build a renewed self. Following the initial blow of diagnosis with the range of initial reactions, patients with acute leukaemia are living in a contracting world; they have to deal with the life in hospital, the several losses and the impact of their illness on their emotions and interpersonal relationships. Several factors take up a buffering role at that stage: coping, support, information and hope. Finally, patients accommodate acute leukaemia in their lives through re-evaluating personal values and assigning new meaning to their experience. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this thematic synthesis are indicative of the impact of acute leukaemia on patients' lives and the processes they use to make sense and accommodate the illness in their life. Increasing our understanding of these processes is warranted to improve patient care.","['Papadopoulou, Constantina', 'Johnston, Bridget', 'Themessl-Huber, Markus']","['Papadopoulou C', 'Johnston B', 'Themessl-Huber M']","['School of Nursing & Midwifery, University of Dundee, 11 Airlie Place, Dundee DD1 4HJ, UK.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which is available for a minority of patients, efficiently prevents recurrences of leukemia by inducing immune-mediated elimination of leukemic cells, and over the past decades, numerous immunotherapeutic protocols have been developed aiming to mimic the graft-versus-leukemia reaction for the prevention of relapse. Here we review past and present strategies for relapse control with focus on overcoming leukemia-related immunosuppression in AML. We envisage future treatment protocols, in which systemic immune activators, such as vaccines, dendritic cell-based therapies, engineered variants of IL-2, or IL-15, are combined with agents that counter immunosuppression mediated by, e.g., the PD/PDL interaction, CTLA-4, CD200, reactive oxygen species, IDO expression, CXCR4, or the KIR/class I interaction, based on characteristics of the prevailing malignant clone. This combinatorial approach may pave the way for individualized immunotherapy in AML.","['Martner, Anna', 'Thoren, Fredrik Bergh', 'Aurelius, Johan', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer']","['Martner A', 'Thoren FB', 'Aurelius J', 'Hellstrand K']","['Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Box 405, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130718,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', '*Secondary Prevention']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia-related immunosuppression', 'Maintenance therapy']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(13)00035-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2013.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2013 Sep;27(5):209-16. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2013.06.006.

We found that expression of WT1(delZ) supported proliferation of human hematopoietic CD34(+) progenitor cells. Moreover, WT1(delZ) transduced cells expressed erythroid markers, including raised levels of STAT5, independently of addition of erythropoietin. At the global gene expression level, WT1(delZ) caused upregulation of genes related to cell division and genes associated with erythroid maturation, in the absence of added erythropoietin.

We analyzed, in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC), the expression of 8 genes that constitute 2 previously reported prognostic expression signatures in NSCLC. METHODS: Fresh-frozen tumor and normal lung samples were obtained at surgery from 135 patients with stage I-III NSCLC (89 (65.9%) SCC, 46 (34.1%) AC). Expression of CSF1 (colony stimulating factor for macrophages), carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3), monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated (MMD), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was assessed in SCC, AC, and in normal lung by quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Metastasis-free survival was analyzed according to the median value of gene expression in the entire NSCLC cohort and separately in SCC and AC. RESULTS: Expression of CA9, CSF1, DUSP6, STAT1, and MMD differed between NSCLC and normal lung. EGFR was more abundant in SCC compared with AC, whereas the reverse was true for DUSP6 and ERBB3. A high expression of CSF1 correlated with shorter metastasis-free survival in the entire NSCLC group (P = .016) and in SCC (P = .049) and AC (P = .034) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Several genes considered prognostic in NSCLC showed significantly different expression in SCC and AC, and thus should be analyzed separately in these 2 subtypes for their prognostic significance. CSF1 is similarly expressed in SCC and AC, and portends a poor outcome in the entire group of patients with NSCLC, and in SCC and AC when considered separately.","['Skrzypski, Marcin', 'Dziadziuszko, Rafal', 'Jassem, Ewa', 'Szymanowska-Narloch, Amelia', 'Gulida, Grazyna', 'Rzepko, Robert', 'Biernat, Wojciech', 'Taron, Miquel', 'Jelitto-Gorska, Malgorzata', 'Marjanski, Tomasz', 'Rzyman, Witold', 'Rosell, Rafael', 'Jassem, Jacek']","['Skrzypski M', 'Dziadziuszko R', 'Jassem E', 'Szymanowska-Narloch A', 'Gulida G', 'Rzepko R', 'Biernat W', 'Taron M', 'Jelitto-Gorska M', 'Marjanski T', 'Rzyman W', 'Rosell R', 'Jassem J']","['Medical University of Gdansk, Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Gdansk, Poland.

We compared the disposition and semen parameters of cryopreserved sperm from individuals referred for sperm banking secondary to a cancer diagnosis to those of sperm from men banking for infertility reasons. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study that reviewed 1118 records from males who presented to bank sperm at Washington University between 1991 and 2010. We collected and analyzed demographics, semen parameters, and disposition of banked sperm. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-three men with cancer and 348 banking for infertility reasons attempted sperm cryopreservation in our unit during the specified time period. The most prevalent cancers in our cohort were testicular (32%), lymphoma (25%), and leukemia (11%). Patients with leukemia had the lowest pre-thaw counts and motility. Most cancer patients (57%) who banked elected to use, transfer to another facility, or keep their specimens in storage. The remaining samples were discarded electively (34%) or following death (8%). Overall semen parameters were similar between the cancer and infertility groups, but demographics, ability to bank a sample, azoospermia rates, length of storage, current banking status, and use of banked sperm differed significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cancer patients who banked survived their cancer and chose to continue storage of banked samples. Cancer patients were more likely than infertility patients to use or continue storage of banked samples. Our study provides evidence that sperm banking is a utilized modality of fertility preservation in patients with a myriad of cancer diagnoses and should be offered to all men facing gonadotoxic therapies. Further work is needed to determine where disparities in access to sperm banking exist to improve the potential for future fertility in these males.","['Johnson, Matrika D', 'Cooper, Amber R', 'Jungheim, Emily S', 'Lanzendorf, Susan E', 'Odem, Randall R', 'Ratts, Valerie S']","['Johnson MD', 'Cooper AR', 'Jungheim ES', 'Lanzendorf SE', 'Odem RR', 'Ratts VS']","['Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, 300 Halket Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.

Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-663, which has recently been reported to be inactivated by hypermethylation in several cancers, may play important roles in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, expression of miR-663 and its promoter methylation remain status unclear in childhood leukemia. METHODS: Promoter methylation status of miR-663 was investigated by methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfate genomic sequencing (BGS). Transcriptional expression of miR-663 was evaluated by semi-quantitative and real-time PCR, and the relationship between expression of miR-663 and promoter methylation was confirmed using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) demethylation reagent. RESULTS: MiR-663 was aberrantly methylated in 45.5% (5/11) leukemia cell lines; BGS showed that the promoter was significantly methylated in three AML cell lines; methylation of miR-663 was significantly higher in Chinese pediatric AML patients [41.4% (29/70)] compared to normal bone marrow (NBM) control samples [10.0% (3/30)]. These results were confirmed by both BGS and 5-Aza demethylation analysis. In addition, miR-663 transcript expression was significantly lower in AML patients, both with and without miR-663 methylation, compared to controls; however, there were no significant differences in clinical features or French-American-British (FAB) classification between patients with and without miR-663 methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of miR-663 was significantly lower in pediatric AML cells compared to NBM controls; furthermore, a high frequency of miR-663 promoter hypermethylation was observed in both AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples. Inactivation of miR-663 by promoter hypermethylation could be affected by 5-Aza demethylation. These findings suggest that hypermethylation of the miR-663 promoter may be an early event in the development of pediatric AML.","['Yan-Fang, Tao', 'Jian, Ni', 'Jun, Lu', 'Na, Wang', 'Pei-Fang, Xiao', 'Wen-Li, Zhao', 'Dong, Wu', 'Li, Pang', 'Jian, Wang', 'Xing, Feng', 'Jian, Pan']","['Yan-Fang T', 'Jian N', 'Jun L', 'Na W', 'Pei-Fang X', 'Wen-Li Z', 'Dong W', 'Li P', 'Jian W', 'Xing F', 'Jian P']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['0 (MIRN663 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3726388,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/08/27 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2350-14-74 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2350-14-74 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2013 Jul 19;14:74. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-14-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is thus very important and holds great potential for improving treatment strategies.

Up to now, expression and function of PLZF in the goat testis has not been known. The objectives of this study were to investigate PLZF expression pattern in the dairy goat and its effect on male goat germline stem cell (mGSC) self-renewal and differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testis development and expression patterns of PLZF in the dairy goat were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, effects of PLZF overexpression on mGSC self-renewal and differentiation were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and BrdU incorporation assay. RESULTS: Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger was essential for dairy goat testis development and expression of several proliferation and pluripotency-associated proteins including OCT4, C-MYC were upregulated by PLZF overexpression. The study demonstrated that PLZF played a key role in maintaining self-renewal of mGSCs and its overexpression enhanced expression of proliferation-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger could function in the dairy goat as well as in other species in maintaining self-renewal of germline stem cells and this study provides a model to study the mechanism on self-renewal and differentiation of mGSCs in livestock.","['Song, W', 'Zhu, H', 'Li, M', 'Li, N', 'Wu, J', 'Mu, H', 'Yao, X', 'Han, W', 'Liu, W', 'Hua, J']","['Song W', 'Zhu H', 'Li M', 'Li N', 'Wu J', 'Mu H', 'Yao X', 'Han W', 'Liu W', 'Hua J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Key Lab for Animal Biotechnology of Agriculture Ministry of China, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Germ Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Goats', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Testis/metabolism/*physiology', '*Zinc Fingers']",PMC6496569,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12048 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2013 Aug;46(4):457-68. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12048.,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the biological and X-ray crystallographic evaluations of both independent C10 diastereomers, 10S- and 10R-methylthio-DDACTHF, bound to human GAR Tfase, including the highest-resolution apo GAR Tfase structure to date (1.52 A). Both diastereomers are potent inhibitors (Ki = 210 nM for 10R, and Ki = 180 nM for 10S) of GAR Tfase and exhibit effective inhibition of human leukemia cell growth (IC(5)(0) = 80 and 50 nM, respectively). Their inhibitory activity was surprisingly high, and these lipophilic C10-substituted analogues show distinct advantages over their hydrophilic counterparts, most strikingly in retaining potency in mutant human leukemia cell lines that lack reduced folate carrier protein activity (IC(5)(0) = 70 and 60 nM, respectively). Structural characterization reveals a new binding mode for these diastereoisomers, in which the lipophilic thiomethyl groups penetrate deeper into a hydrophobic pocket within the folate-binding site. In silico docking simulations of three other sulfur-containing folate analogues also indicate that this hydrophobic cleft represents a favorable region for binding lipophilic substituents. Overall, these results suggest sulfur and its substitutions play an important role in not only the binding of anti-folates to GAR Tfase but also the selectivity and cellular activity (growth inhibition), thereby presenting new possibilities for the future design of potent and selective anti-folate drugs that target GAR Tfase.","['Connelly, Stephen', 'DeMartino, Jessica K', 'Boger, Dale L', 'Wilson, Ian A']","['Connelly S', 'DeMartino JK', 'Boger DL', 'Wilson IA']","['Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130719,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (10-methylthio-DDACTHF)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.2.3 (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.13 (GART protein, human)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology']",PMC3823235,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi4005182 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2013 Jul 30;52(30):5133-44. doi: 10.1021/bi4005182.

Nevertheless, its heterogeneity has been demonstrated and the clinical significance of biallelic 13q deletions remains controversial. We compared the clinico-biological characteristics of a series of 627 patients harbouring isolated 13q deletions by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), either monoallelic (13q x 1), biallelic (13q x 2), or the coexistence of both clones (13qM). The most frequent 13q deletion was 13q x 1 (82.1%), while 13q x 2 and 13qM represented 8.6% and 9.3% of patients respectively. The median percentage of altered nuclei significantly differed across groups: 55%, 72.5% and 80% in 13q x 1, 13q x 2 and 13qM (P < 0.001). However, no significant differences in the clinical outcome among 13q groups were found. From 84 patients with sequential FISH studies, eight patients lost the remaining allele of 13q whereas none of them changed from 13q x 2 to the 13q x 1 group. The percentage of abnormal cells detected by FISH had a significant impact on the five-year cumulative incidence of treatment and the overall survival, 90% being the highest predictive power cut-off. In conclusion, loss of the remaining 13q allele is not enough to entail a worse prognosis in CLL. The presence of isolated 13q deletion can be risk-stratified according to the percentage of altered cells.","['Puiggros, Anna', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Grau, Javier', 'Hernandez, Jose Angel', 'Marugan, Isabel', 'Ardanaz, Maite', 'Gonzalez, Teresa', 'Valiente, Alberto', 'Osma, Mar', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Sanzo, Carmen', 'Carrio, Ana', 'Ortega, Margarita', 'Santacruz, Rodrigo', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Carbonell, Felix', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Hernandez, Jesus Maria', 'Espinet, Blanca']","['Puiggros A', 'Delgado J', 'Rodriguez-Vicente A', 'Collado R', 'Aventin A', 'Luno E', 'Grau J', 'Hernandez JA', 'Marugan I', 'Ardanaz M', 'Gonzalez T', 'Valiente A', 'Osma M', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Sanzo C', 'Carrio A', 'Ortega M', 'Santacruz R', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Abella E', 'Bosch F', 'Carbonell F', 'Sole F', 'Hernandez JM', 'Espinet B']","['Laboratori de Citogenetica Molecular, Laboratori de Citologia Hematologica, Servei de Patologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain; Grup de Recerca Translacional en Neoplasies Hematologiques, Cancer Research Program, IMIM-Hospital del Mar., Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['13q deletion', 'biallelic', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'monoallelic', 'prognosis']",2013/07/23 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12479 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Oct;163(1):47-54. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12479.

In rare cases, ALL patients may present with eosinophilia. CASE REPORT: Here, a 5-year old boy was admitted to our hospital with a possible diagnosis of appendicitis. This patient's complete blood cell count demonstrated leukocytosis with severe eosinophilia. Following a 1-month clinical investigation, 2 bone marrow aspirations, and flow cytometry analysis, a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was proposed. Finally, the patient was transferred to the oncology ward to receive standard therapeutic protocol, which resulted in disease remission. After chemotherapy for 2 years, patient is successfully treated. CONCLUSIONS: ALL is diagnosed by eosinophilia in rare cases. These patients need immediate diagnosis and intensive therapy due to worsened prognosis of ALL presenting as hypereosinophilia.","['Rezamand, Azim', 'Ghorashi, Ziaaedin', 'Ghorashi, Sona', 'Nezami, Nariman']","['Rezamand A', 'Ghorashi Z', 'Ghorashi S', 'Nezami N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tabriz University (Medical Sciences), Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130508,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,,,PMC3715333,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'eosinophilia', 'eosinophilic myelodysplasia']",2013/07/23 06:00,2013/07/23 06:01,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12659/AJCR.883905 [doi]', '883905 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2013 May 8;14:143-6. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.883905.

Since the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has been implicated in facilitating melanoma cell apoptosis, we investigated the effect of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on regulating the responses of melanoma cells to TRAIL. Co-treatment of melanoma cell lines with WNT3A-conditioned media and recombinant TRAIL significantly enhanced apoptosis compared to treatment with TRAIL alone. This apoptosis correlates with increased abundance of the pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11 and BBC3, and with decreased abundance of the anti-apoptotic regulator Mcl1. We then confirmed the involvement of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by demonstrating that siRNA-mediated knockdown of an intracellular beta-catenin antagonist, AXIN1, or treating cells with an inhibitor of GSK-3 also enhanced melanoma cell sensitivity to TRAIL.

Despite extensive studies on E2F, the molecular mechanisms that control specific biological functions of the E2F1 transcription factor are still not fully understood. Here we have addressed the molecular underpinnings of paradoxical functions of E2F1 in a tumour microenvironment using the 'X15-myc' oncomouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. We observed that the HBx oncoprotein of hepatitis B virus regulates E2F1 functions by interfering with its binding to Skp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. The HBx-Skp2 interaction led to the accumulation of transcriptionally active E2F1 and histone methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein. During early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, the increased E2F1 activity promoted cellular proliferation by stimulating the genes involved in cell cycle control and replication. However, during the late stages, E2F1 triggered replication-stress-induced DNA damage and sensitized cells to apoptotic death in a p53-independent manner. Interestingly, the different promoter occupancy of MLL1 during the early and late stages of tumour development seemed to specify the proliferative and apoptotic functions of E2F1, through its dynamic interaction with the co-activator CBP or co-repressor Brg1. Thus, the temporally regulated promoter occupancy of histone methyltransferase could be a regulatory mechanism associated with the diverse cellular functions of the E2F family of transcription factors.","['Swarnalatha, Manickavinayaham', 'Singh, Anup Kumar', 'Kumar, Vijay']","['Swarnalatha M', 'Singh AK', 'Kumar V']","['Virology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130718,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatoblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology', 'Ubiquitination']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'DNA damage', 'E2F1', 'HBx', 'MLL1', 'Replication stress', 'X15-myc mice']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.126235 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.126235 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Oct 15;126(Pt 20):4636-46. doi: 10.1242/jcs.126235.

PROCEDURE: Using the Pediatric Health Information System database we established a retrospective cohort of patients treated for newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia with ATRA between January 1999 and September 2009 in 32 of 43 PHIS contributing free-standing pediatric hospitals in the United States. Standard statistical methods were used to determine in-hospital induction mortality, ATRA administration, and resource utilization during a 60-day observation period. RESULTS: A total of 163 children were identified who met eligibility criteria for cohort inclusion; 52% were female and 76% were white with an average age of 12.7 years. A total of 12 patients (7.4%) died, with 7 (58.3%) dying within the first 7 days of first admission. The mean time to first ATRA exposure increased with decreasing age (P = 0.0016).

These improvements have afforded more robust analyses of the relationship between response and survival. Generally, these studies have demonstrated that improvements in the quality of response across all stages of treatment are associated with better disease control and longer survival. Thus, achievement of maximal response should be strongly considered, particularly in the frontline setting, but must also be balanced with tolerability, quality of life and patient preferences. In select patients, achievement of a lesser response may be adequate to prolong survival, and attempts to treat these patients to a deeper response may place them at unnecessary risk without significant benefit. Maintenance therapy has been shown to improve the quality of response and disease control and, in some studies, survival. Studies support maintenance therapy for high-risk patients as a standard of care, and there are emerging data supporting maintenance therapy in standard-risk patients to improve progression-free and possibly overall survival. Multidrug regimens combining a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD have shown exceptional response outcomes with acceptable increases in toxicity in both the frontline and salvage settings, and are becoming a standard treatment approach. Moving forward, the use of immunophenotypic and molecular response criteria will be essential in better understanding the impact of highly active and continuous treatment regimens across myeloma patient populations. Future translational studies will help to develop antimyeloma agents to their fullest potential. The introduction of novel targeted therapies, including the IMiD pomalidomide and the proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and ixazomib (MLN9708), will provide greater options to individualize treatment and help patients achieve a clinically meaningful response.","['Lonial, S', 'Anderson, K C']","['Lonial S', 'Anderson KC']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130719,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3918869,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013220 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.220 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Feb;28(2):258-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.220.

In contrast, MUC1(low) cell populations established normal hematopoiesis in the NSG model. Functional blockade of the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit with the peptide inhibitor GO-203 depleted established AML in vivo, but did not affect engraftment of normal hematopoietic cells.

Hh signaling inhibitors are predicted to have a minimal effect when the Smoothened receptor is mutated. Implications that Gli proteins are molecular targets of arsenic trioxide (ATO) action prompted us to investigate the expression of Hh signaling in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the influence of ATO on the Hh signaling pathway in APL. METHODS: Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were employed to analyze the expression of Hh pathway components and the influence of ATO on the Hh signaling pathway in APL. RESULTS: The expression of Hh pathway components was significantly upregulated in APL. In newly diagnosed APL patients, Gli2 expression was significantly positively correlated with Gli1 (R = 0.57, p < 0.001) and Smo (R = 0.56, p < 0.001) and the expression of Hh pathway components was significantly higher in the high WBC group (p < 0.05). ATO can significantly downregulate the expression of Hh pathway components in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Hh pathway is aberrantly activated in APL and associated with a bad prognostic factor. ATO can effectively inhibit the expression of the Hh pathway. The obtained data give the first clinical evidence for the application of ATO in tumors exhibiting an aberrantly activated Hh pathway.","['Yang, Dongguang', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Ye, Xiangmei', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Liu, Xiuhua', 'Li, Yang', 'Shi, Ce', 'Wang, Hongling', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Yang D', 'Cao F', 'Ye X', 'Zhao H', 'Liu X', 'Li Y', 'Shi C', 'Wang H', 'Zhou J']","['Health Ministry Key Lab of Cell Transplantation, Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology and Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (GLI2 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Patched Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (SMO protein, human)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Patched Receptors', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/biosynthesis', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2']",,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000351603 [pii]', '10.1159/000351603 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2013;130(4):260-7. doi: 10.1159/000351603.

The antiviral activity of PT was also reported against a number of RNA viruses. In this paper, we showed that PT could effectively inhibit herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). PT inhibited HSV late gene (Glycoprotein D, gD) expression and the production of viral progeny, and this action was dependent on Zn(2+). Further studies showed that PT suppressed the expression of HSV immediate early (IE) gene, the infected cell polypeptide 4 (ICP4), but had less effect on another regulatory IE protein, ICP0. It was found that PT treatment could interfere with cellular ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), leading to the inhibition of HSV-2-induced IkappaB-alpha degradation to inhibit NF-kappaB activation and enhanced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) stability in nucleus. However, PT did not show direct inhibition of 26S proteasome activity. Instead, it induced Zn(2+) influx, which facilitated the dysregulation of UPS and the accumulation of intracellular ubiquitin-conjugates. UPS inhibition by PT caused disruption of IkappaB-alpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation thus leading to marked reduction of viral titer.","['Qiu, Min', 'Chen, Yu', 'Chu, Ying', 'Song, Siwei', 'Yang, Na', 'Gao, Jie', 'Wu, Zhiwei']","['Qiu M', 'Chen Y', 'Chu Y', 'Song S', 'Yang N', 'Gao J', 'Wu Z']","['Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130715,Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thiones)', '6GK82EC25D (pyrithione)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Herpes Simplex/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 2, Human/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Thiones/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antiviral activity', 'Herpes simplex virus', 'NF-kappaB', 'Pyrithione (PT)', 'Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)', 'Zinc ionophore']",2013/07/23 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-3542(13)00188-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 2013 Oct;100(1):44-53. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.07.001.

Biological targeted therapies on this disease need to be further investigated and may help to improve the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: This study examined the anti-tumor activity of the histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) combined with the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) inhibitor temsirolimus in Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, as well as in primary tumor cells and a murine xenograft model. RESULTS: Co-treatment of VPA and temsirolimus synergistically inhibited the tumor cell growth and triggered the autophagic cell death, with a significant inhibition of MTOR signaling and MYC oncoprotein. Functioned as a class I HDAC inhibitor, VPA potentiated the effect of temsirolimus on autophagy through inhibiting HDAC1. Molecular silencing of HDAC1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated VPA-mediated regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B and LC3-I/II, regression of tumor cell growth and induction of autophagy. Meanwhile, VPA counteracted temsirolimus-induced AKT activation via HDAC3 inhibition. HDAC3 siRNA abrogated the ability of VPA to modulate AKT phosphorylation, to suppress tumor cell growth and to induce autophagy. Strong antitumor effect was also observed on primary tumor cells while sparing normal hematopoiesis ex vivo. In a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Namalwa cells, dual treatment efficiently blocked tumor growth, inhibited MYC and induced in situ autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirmed the synergistic effect of the HDAC and MTOR inhibitors on Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma, and provided an insight into clinical application of targeting autophagy in treating MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies.","['Dong, Li Hua', 'Cheng, Shu', 'Zheng, Zhong', 'Wang, Li', 'Shen, Yang', 'Shen, Zhi Xiang', 'Chen, Sai Juan', 'Zhao, Wei Li']","['Dong LH', 'Cheng S', 'Zheng Z', 'Wang L', 'Shen Y', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen SJ', 'Zhao WL']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130718,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '624KN6GM2T (temsirolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3722002,,,2013/07/23 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-53 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-53 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jul 18;6:53. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem cells (LSCs) were separated and transplanted into NOD/SCID mice to establish a mouse model of acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL). Anti-human CD47 antibody, alone or combined with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), was used to treat the mice with AMoL for 7-14 days, and therapeutic efficacy was assessed. LSCs were cultured together with mouse macrophages in culture medium containing anti-CD47 or anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody for 2 hours, to observe the phagocytic ability of macrophages to LSCs. RESULTS: CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs existed among THP-1 cells, with a content of about (0.12 +/- 0.06)%, and a mouse model of AML was successfully established after the purified CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs (97.0% +/- 1.7%) were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. The in vivo experiment showed that mice with AMoL had the most significant decrease in CD33(+)CD45(+) leukemia cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow and survived the longest after being treated with Ara-C (7 days) plus anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (14 days) (P < 0.01). After 2 hours of in vitro culture, the phagocytic index in the culture medium containing anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody was significantly higher than in the culture medium containing anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody (76.9% +/- 12.2% vs 7.60% +/- 2.4%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of CD47 is an adverse prognostic factor in AML.

METHODS: Twenty-eight children with MDS between January 2006 and March 2012 were enrolled in the study. Clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, treatment and outcomes were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Anemia (96%), bleeding (68%), fever (68%) and hepatosplenomegaly (61%) were main clinical manifestaions in the 28 patients. Three cases (11%) converted into acute monocytic leukemia (M5), erythroleukemia (M6) or acute megakaryocytic leukemia (M7) one to two months later. Bone marrow proliferation mainly demonstrated as active or obviously active. One or two lineages of hematopoietic dysplasia were mostly observed in all 28 cases and obvious iron metabolism disorders were found in these patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 45% of the 28 cases, most of which were numeral chromosome abnormalities. T cell, B cell and NK cell numbers decreased, Th cell numbers decreased, Ts cell numbers increased and Th /Ts inversed. Eight cases gave up treatment when confirmed. Of the 8 cases receiving symptomatic and supportive treatment alone, one was lost, one showed disease stability, and the remaining 6 cases showed disease progression. One patient who underwent induced differentiation and one who received hematopoietic therapy showed disease progression. Ten patients underwent chemotherapy. Two cases had no bone marrow remission after single agent chemotherapy. Of the 8 cases who underwent multi-drug combination chemotherapy, 4 cases achieved partial or complete remission of bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric MDS is characterized by a lack of typical clinical manifestations, and a high rate of conversion to leukemia. Bone marrow proliferation is mainly active in children with MDS. One or two lineages of hematopoietic dysplasia is common. Among the cytogenetic abnormalities, numeral chromosome abnormalities are common. Obvious iron metabolism disorders and abnormal cellular immunity are found in children with MDS.

From April 2010 to May 2011, 45 consecutive patients with AML aged 1-18 years were prospectively enrolled along with nine healthy controls. Ig were assessed at diagnosis, post-induction, post-consolidation, 3 and 6 months follow-up and relapse. At diagnosis, Ig levels were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. Patienths with gum hypertrophy had low Ig levels (IgG, p = 0.007; IgA, p = 0.003; IgM, p = 0.06). Baseline Ig did not correlate with complete remission (CR). Patients who relapsed had a lower baseline IgA level than those in continuous CR (169 +/- 94 g/dL vs. 310 +/- 177 g/dL, p = 0.019). Patients with a low baseline IgA level (less than median) had inferior disease-free-survival (DFS) on multivariate analysis (p = 0.048). Post-induction, IgM (p < 0.001) and IgA (p = 0.048) were significantly reduced as compared to their baseline values. On serial follow-up in patients who were in continuous CR, there was a significant decrease in IgA from post-induction until 6 months after treatment completion. This is the first study to evaluate the trend of humoral immunity in sequential pediatric patients with AML. Our study demonstrates that in pediatric AML, baseline Ig were higher than in controls. Gum hypertrophy was observed in patients with low Ig (IgA and IgG) levels. Relatively lower baseline IgA predicted disease relapse and inferior DFS. On serial follow-up, IgA significantly decreased in those who continued to stay in CR but not in patients who relapsed, suggesting an association of IgA with leukemogenesis.","['Bansal, Anuj Kumar', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Kumar, Uma', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Bansal AK', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Kumar U', 'Bakhshi S']",['Department of Medical Oncology.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130903,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Immunoglobulin A/*blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood/immunology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/20 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/20 06:00'],"['2013/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.825907 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 May;55(5):1132-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.825907.

Diterpenoids containing an abietane skeleton including taxodone (1) and taxodione (2), as well as the semisynthetic derivatives 12, 14, 15, 17, and 22, were the most cytotoxic compounds for human leukemia cells. Overexpression of the protective mitochondrial proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) did not confer resistance to abietane diterpene-induced cytotoxicity. Studies performed on HL-60 cells indicated that growth inhibition triggered by compounds 1, 12, 14, and 15 was caused by induction of apoptosis. This was prevented by the nonspecific caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and, in the case of compounds 14 and 15, reduced by the selective caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK. Cell death induced by these abietane diterpenes was found to be associated with the release of mitochondrial proteins, including cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), and modulated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases signaling and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.","['Burmistrova, Olga', 'Simoes, M Fatima', 'Rijo, Patricia', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Bermejo, Jaime', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Burmistrova O', 'Simoes MF', 'Rijo P', 'Quintana J', 'Bermejo J', 'Estevez F']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Unidad Asociada al Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-CSIC, Instituto Canario de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130718,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (taxodone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Abietanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/20 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/20 06:00'],"['2013/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np400172k [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2013 Aug 23;76(8):1413-23. doi: 10.1021/np400172k.

The key feature of our method is the introduction of dynamic pseudo-observations constructed from the prediction probabilities at different landmark prediction times. They specifically address the issue of estimating covariate effects directly on the cumulative incidence scale in competing risks. A flexible generalized linear model based on these dynamic pseudo-observations and a generalized estimation equations approach to estimate the baseline and covariate effects will result in the desired dynamic predictions and robust standard errors. Our approach has a number of attractive features. It focuses directly on the prediction probabilities of interest, avoiding in this way complex modeling of cause-specific hazards or subdistribution hazards. As a result, it is robust against departures from these omnibus models. From a computational point of view an advantage of our approach is that it can be fitted with existing statistical software and that a variety of link functions and regression models can be considered, once the dynamic pseudo-observations have been estimated. We illustrate our approach on a real data set of chronic myeloid leukemia patients after bone marrow transplantation.","['Nicolaie, M A', 'van Houwelingen, J C', 'de Witte, T M', 'Putter, H']","['Nicolaie MA', 'van Houwelingen JC', 'de Witte TM', 'Putter H']","['Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

Our main objective is to investigate the prognostic impact of brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) expression in AML with normal karyotype. METHODS: BAALC expression was analysed using quantitative real time (QRT) PCR. RESULTS: High expression was detected in 22 of 45 patients (48.9%) and its expression did not correlate with the clinical parameters of patients. High BAALC expressers had significantly lower incidence of CR (22.7% vs. 73.9%; p = 0.001), higher mortality rate (72.1% vs. 39.1%; p = 0.023), showed significantly shorter DFS (mean 4.5 vs. 13.21 months, p < 0.001), and inferior overall survival (7.02 vs. 15.02 months, p < 0.001).

The lysis of KG1A and K562 cells by NK cells was analyzed in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay to investigate whether KIR2DL1 expression on NK cells would affect the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Significant differences in KIR2DL1 frequency were noted among the donors (range, 27.14% - 92.49%).

The purified HL-60 cells were treated with cytochalasin B (CB) alone or combined with colcchicine and enucleated by isopycnic gradient centrifugation on 50% Percoll at 25 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Cytoplasts made from HL-60 cells were purified through gradient centrifugation by 37%, 38% and 40% Percoll, respectively. The final cytoplasts were identified by Wright-Giemsa staining and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylidole dihydrochloride (DAPI)/5, 6-carboxyflu-orescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) double-staining. The phenotype and mitochondrial membrane potential of HL-60 cytoplasts were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results indicated that the enucleation ratio of HL-60 cells induced by CB combined with colcchicine was up to 91. 98% +/-4. 29%, which was significantly higher than that in CB alone group (74. 95% +/- 3. 02%)(P<0. 01).

Essential for the oncogenic potential of RUNX1/ETO is the oligomerization of the chimeric fusion protein through the nervy homology region 2 (NHR2) within ETO. In previous studies, we have shown that the intracellular expression of peptides containing the NHR2 domain inhibits RUNX1/ETO oligomerization, thereby preventing cell proliferation and inducing differentiation of RUNX1/ETO transformed cells. Here, we show that introduction of a recombinant TAT-NHR2 fusion polypeptide into the RUNX1/ETO growth-dependent myeloid cell line Kasumi-1 results in decreased cell proliferation and increased numbers of apoptotic cells. This effect was highly specific and mediated by binding the TAT-NHR2 peptide to ETO sequences, as TAT-polypeptides containing the oligomerization domain of BCR did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis in Kasumi-1 cells. Thus, the selective interference with NHR2-mediated oligomerization by peptides represents a challenging but promising strategy for the inhibition of the leukemogenic potential of RUNX1/ETO in t(8;21)-positive leukemia.","['Bartel, Yvonne', 'Grez, Manuel', 'Wichmann, Christian']","['Bartel Y', 'Grez M', 'Wichmann C']","['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism']",PMC3707205,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/297692 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:297692. doi: 10.1155/2013/297692.

Recent studies have shown that inhibition of Src family kinases (SFKs) resulted in enhancement of retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the question of whether the SFK inhibitor PP2 enhanced the differentiation of NB4 cells when combined with ATO as well as when combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). In addition, we attempted to determine the difference in retinoic acid-induced gene expression between cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATRA and in combination with ATO. RESULTS: SFK inhibitor PP2 induced significant enhancement of ATRA- or ATO-induced differentiation of NB4 cells. A significantly stronger synergistic effect was observed when PP2 was combined with ATRA than when combined with ATO. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a significant increase in CD11b-positive granulocytes up to 60.73% and 31.58%, respectively. These results were confirmed by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. These effects were not related to apoptosis. Results of Annexin-V-fluorescein staining revealed that PP2 combined with ATRA or PP2 combined with ATO did not induce apoptosis in NB4 cells. Retinoic acid-induced gene expression was different in both groups. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression showed a significant increase in cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATRA, whereas cathepsin D expression showed a significant increase in cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATO. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that SFK inhibitor PP2 enhanced acute promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation when combined with either ATRA or ATO with difference in activation of retinoic acid-induced genes.","['Yoon, Suk-Gu', 'Cheong, Hee-Jeong', 'Kim, Sook-Ja', 'Kim, Kyoung Ha', 'Lee, Sang-Cheol', 'Lee, Namsu', 'Park, Hee Sook', 'Won, Jong-Ho']","['Yoon SG', 'Cheong HJ', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim KH', 'Lee SC', 'Lee N', 'Park HS', 'Won JH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Institute for Clinical Molecular Biology Research, Soonchunhang University Hospital, Soonchunhang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130630,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,PMC3710962,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'All-trans-retinoic acid', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Cell differentiation', 'Src kinase']",2013/07/19 06:00,2013/07/19 06:01,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2013.45.2.126 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2013 Jun;45(2):126-33. doi: 10.4143/crt.2013.45.2.126.

Gene repression imposed by ND10 is released by a viral protein, ICP0, via degradation of the ND10 constituents promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100 and the subsequent dispersal of ND10 bodies. In order to understand the dynamic interaction between ICP0 and ND10, we carried out deletion mapping to identify the domains of ICP0 responsible for its association with ND10. Here, we report the following. (i) An ND10 entry signal (ND10-ES), located between residues 245 and 474, is required for ICP0 to penetrate and fuse with ND10. ICP0 lacking ND10-ES adheres to the surface of ND10 but fails to enter. (ii) In the absence of ND10-ES, the E3 ubiquitin ligase of ICP0 facilitates the transient adhesion of the truncated ICP0 to the ND10 surface, whereas the presence of ND10-ES in ICP0 renders ND10 fusion regardless of the E3 ligase activity. (iii) The C terminus of ICP0 is required for retention of ICP0 in ND10 but plays no role in the recruitment process. (iv) The adverse effects of an inactive RING domain on viral replication are partially reversed by deleting either ND10-ES or the C-terminal retention domain, suggesting that additional ICP0 functions require the release of ICP0 from ND10. Based on these results, we conclude that association of ICP0 and ND10 is a dynamic process, in which three sequential steps--adhesion, fusion, and retention--are adopted to stabilize the interaction. A faithful execution of these steps defines the ultimate productivity of the virus.","['Gu, Haidong', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Roizman, Bernard']","['Gu H', 'Zheng Y', 'Roizman B']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. haidong.gu@wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3753982,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01487-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01487-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Sep;87(18):10244-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01487-13.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns and the prognostic relevance of miR-375 in pediatric AML. Expression levels of miR-375 in bone marrow mononuclear cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR in a cohort of 106 patients with newly diagnosed pediatric AML. Expression levels of miR-375 in the bone marrow of pediatric AML patients were significantly higher than those in normal controls (P < 0.001). Then, miR-375 upregulation occurred more frequently in French-American-British classification subtype M7 than in other subtypes (P < 0.001). Regarding to cytogenetic risk, the expression levels of miR-375 in pediatric AML patients with unfavorable karyotypes were dramatically higher than those in intermediate and favorable groups (P = 0.002). Moreover, high miR-375 expression was significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.001) in pediatric AML patients. Multivariate analysis further identified miR-375 expression and cytogenetics risk as independent prognostic factors for both relapse-free survival and overall survival. In particular, the prognostic relevance of miR-375 expression was more obvious in the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Our findings suggest for the first time that the upregulation of miR-375 may be one of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of pediatric AML. Since its correlation with poor relapse-free survival and overall survival, miR-375 may be a novel biomarker to improve the management of pediatric AML patients.","['Wang, Zhengyan', 'Hong, Ze', 'Gao, Feng', 'Feng, Weijing']","['Wang Z', 'Hong Z', 'Gao F', 'Feng W']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Hospital Affiliated of Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, 62 Huaihai Road South, Huai'an, 223002, P.

Evaluation of the clinical impact of alloHSCT and autoHSCT vs chemotherapy was performed by addressing time dependency in the statistical analyses. Thirty-two patients proceeded to alloHSCT from a matched related (MRD, n = 29) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD, n = 3), 20 to autoHSCT in CR1 and 72 received chemotherapy. Relapse-free survival was significantly superior in patients receiving an alloHSCT or autoHSCT in CR1 as compared with chemotherapy (P < .001), whereas overall survival was not different (P < .12).

Here, we show that the IGF1R protein is overexpressed in various CLL subsets, suggesting a contribution to CLL pathology. Indeed, we show that IGF1R knockdown in primary human CLL cells compromised their viability. Likewise, IGF1R inhibition with 3 structurally distinct compounds induced apoptosis, even in the presence of protective stroma components. Furthermore, IGF1R inhibition effectively limited CLL development in Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice and of primary human CLL xenografts. In agreement with its prosurvival function, IGF1R inhibition affected the phosphorylation and/or expression of multiple signaling proteins. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib yielded similar effects on these signaling elements as IGF1R inhibitors. Indeed, IGF1R appears to be a direct sorafenib target because sorafenib decreased IGF1R expression and phosphorylation, counteracted insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) binding to CLL cells, and lowered the in vitro kinase activity of recombinant, purified IGF1R. Thus, we demonstrate that blockade of IGF1R-mediated signaling represents a novel mechanism of action for sorafenib in CLL. Importantly, IGF1R inhibitors compromise CLL viability in their microenvironment context, implicating this RTK as a promising therapeutic target.","['Yaktapour, Niuscha', 'Ubelhart, Rudolf', 'Schuler, Julia', 'Aumann, Konrad', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Burger, Meike', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Brummer, Tilman', 'Zirlik, Katja']","['Yaktapour N', 'Ubelhart R', 'Schuler J', 'Aumann K', 'Dierks C', 'Burger M', 'Pfeifer D', 'Jumaa H', 'Veelken H', 'Brummer T', 'Zirlik K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53541-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-484386 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 29;122(9):1621-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-484386.

Although enhancer-deleted lentiviruses are less likely to result in insertional oncogenesis, there is evidence that they may perturb transcript splicing, and one patient with a benign clonal expansion of lentivirally transduced HPSC has been reported. The rhesus macaque model provides an opportunity for informative long-term analysis to ask whether transduction impacts on long-term HSPC properties. We used two techniques to examine whether lentivirally transduced HSPCs from eight rhesus macaques transplanted 1-13.5 years previously are perturbed at a population level, comparing telomere length as a measure of replicative history and gene expression profile of vector positive versus vector negative cells. There were no differences in telomere lengths between sorted GFP+ and GFP- blood cells, suggesting that lentiviral (LV) transduction did not globally disrupt replicative patterns. Bone marrow GFP+ and GF- CD34+ cells showed no differences in gene expression using unsupervised and principal component analysis. These studies did not uncover any global long-term perturbation of proliferation, differentiation, or other important functional parameters of transduced HSPCs in the rhesus macaque model.","['Sellers, Stephanie E', 'Dumitriu, Bogdan', 'Morgan, Mary J', 'Hughes, William M', 'Wu, Colin O', 'Raghavarchari, Nalini', 'Yang, Yanqin', 'Uchida, Naoya', 'Tisdale, John F', 'An, Dong S', 'Chen, Irvin S', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Larochelle, Andre', 'Young, Neal S', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Sellers SE', 'Dumitriu B', 'Morgan MJ', 'Hughes WM', 'Wu CO', 'Raghavarchari N', 'Yang Y', 'Uchida N', 'Tisdale JF', 'An DS', 'Chen IS', 'Hematti P', 'Donahue RE', 'Larochelle A', 'Young NS', 'Calado RT', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, David Geffen Schools of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, David Geffen Schools of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130718,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', '*Telomere', 'Transcriptome', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",PMC3978805,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31119-4 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2013.168 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2014 Jan;22(1):52-8. doi: 10.1038/mt.2013.168.

Here we show that the IDH variants in CS are also associated with a hypermethylation phenotype and display increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, supporting the role of mutant IDH-produced 2-hydroxyglutarate as an inhibitor of TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Meta-analysis of the acute myeloid leukaemia, low-grade glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and CS methylation data identifies cancer-specific effectors within the retinoic acid receptor activation pathway among the hypermethylated targets.

About 20%-30% of these infants subsequently develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). Somatic mutations leading to the exclusive production of a short GATA1 isoform (GATA1s) occur in all cases of DS-TMD and DS-AMKL. Mice engineered to exclusively produce GATA1s have marked megakaryocytic progenitor (MkP) hyperproliferation during early fetal liver (FL) hematopoiesis, but not during postnatal BM hematopoiesis, mirroring the spontaneous resolution of DS-TMD. The mechanisms that underlie these developmental stage-specific effects are incompletely understood. Here, we report a striking upregulation of type I IFN-responsive gene expression in prospectively isolated mouse BM- versus FL-derived MkPs. Exogenous IFN-alpha markedly reduced the hyperproliferation FL-derived MkPs of GATA1s mice in vitro. Conversely, deletion of the alpha/beta IFN receptor 1 (Ifnar1) gene or injection of neutralizing IFN-alpha/beta antibodies increased the proliferation of BM-derived MkPs of GATA1s mice beyond the initial postnatal period. We also found that these differences existed in human FL versus BM megakaryocytes and that primary DS-TMD cells expressed type I IFN-responsive genes. We propose that increased type I IFN signaling contributes to the developmental stage-specific effects of GATA1s and possibly the spontaneous resolution of DS-TMD.","['Woo, Andrew J', 'Wieland, Karen', 'Huang, Hui', 'Akie, Thomas E', 'Piers, Taylor', 'Kim, Jonghwan', 'Cantor, Alan B']","['Woo AJ', 'Wieland K', 'Huang H', 'Akie TE', 'Piers T', 'Kim J', 'Cantor AB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130701,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,,,PMC3726146,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/07/19 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['40609 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI40609 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Clin Invest. 2013 Jul 1. pii: 40609. doi: 10.1172/JCI40609.,['R01 HL075705/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive microarray studies on cultured cells have led to the identification of three LIF signatures.

To characterise the effects of Mras on cell pluripotency and differentiation, we used gain- and loss-of-function strategies in mESCs and in the Xenopus laevis embryo, in which Mras gene structure and protein sequence are conserved. We show that persistent knockdown of Mras in mESCs reduces expression of specific master genes and that MRAS plays a crucial role in the downregulation of OCT4 and NANOG protein levels upon differentiation. In Xenopus, we demonstrate the potential of Mras to modulate cell fate at early steps of development and during neurogenesis. Overexpression of Mras allows gastrula cells to retain responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin.

The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is pivotal in mdDA neuron development and loss of Pitx3 results in programming deficits in a rostrolateral subpopulation of mdDA neurons destined to form the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reminiscent of the specific cell loss observed in PD. We show here that in adult mice in which the gene encoding a second homeoprotein, engrailed 1 (En1), has been deleted, dramatic loss of mdDA neurons and striatal innervation defects were observed, partially reminiscent of defects observed in Pitx3(-/-) mice. We then continue to reveal developmental crosstalk between En1 and Pitx3 through genome-wide expression analysis. During development, both En1 and Pitx3 are required to induce expression of mdDA genes in the rostrolateral subset destined to form the SNc. By contrast, Pitx3 and En1 reciprocally regulate a separate gene cluster, which includes Cck, demarcating a caudal mdDA subset in wild-type embryos. Whereas En1 is crucial for induction of this caudal phenotype, Pitx3 antagonizes it rostrolaterally. The combinatorial action of En1 and Pitx3 is potentially realized through at least three levels of molecular interaction: (1) influencing each other's expression level, (2) releasing histone deacetylase-mediated repression of Nurr1 target genes and (3) modulating En1 activity through Pitx3-driven activation of En1 modulatory proteins. These findings show how two crucial mediators of mdDA neuronal development, En1 and Pitx3, interact in dopaminergic subset specification, the importance of which is exemplified by the specific vulnerability of the SNc found in PD.","['Veenvliet, Jesse V', 'Dos Santos, Maria T M Alves', 'Kouwenhoven, Willemieke M', 'von Oerthel, Lars', 'Lim, Jamie L', 'van der Linden, Annemarie J A', 'Koerkamp, Marian J A Groot', 'Holstege, Frank C P', 'Smidt, Marten P']","['Veenvliet JV', 'Dos Santos MT', 'Kouwenhoven WM', 'von Oerthel L', 'Lim JL', 'van der Linden AJ', 'Koerkamp MJ', 'Holstege FC', 'Smidt MP']","['Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 3511 PG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (En1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nr4a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein PITX3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Dopaminergic Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/innervation/metabolism', 'Embryonic Induction', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mesencephalon/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Dopamine', 'Midbrain', 'Mouse', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Substantia nigra', 'Transcription']",2013/07/19 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.094565 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.094565 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2013 Aug;140(16):3373-84. doi: 10.1242/dev.094565.

As tribbles appear not to function as kinases, there has been debate surrounding their functional classification. Tribbles have been proposed to function as adaptor molecules facilitating degradation of their target proteins. Tribbles have also been proposed to mediate signalling changes to MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades and also to function as decoy kinases interfering with the activity of known kinases. The present review discusses the functionally divergent roles of tribbles as molecular adaptors mediating degradation, changes to signalling cascades and action as decoy kinases.","['Lohan, Fiona', 'Keeshan, Karen']","['Lohan F', 'Keeshan K']","[""Institute of Cancer Sciences, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, 21 Shelley Road, Glasgow G12 0ZD, Scotland, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20130105 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20130105 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2013 Aug;41(4):1096-100. doi: 10.1042/BST20130105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then performed a phase II trial of perifosine in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL to assess response, outcomes, toxicity and ex vivo correlative measures. After 3 months of treatment, six of eight patients showed stable disease, one achieved a partial response and one had progressive disease. Median event-free survival and overall survival in all patients treated were 3.9 and 9.7 months. Adverse events included hematologic, infectious/fever, pain, gastrointestinal and constitutional toxicities. Unexpectedly, AKT phosphorylation in CLL lymphocytes from treated patients was not correlated with response. Additionally, perifosine did not inhibit AKT phosphorylation in cultured CLL lymphocytes. Perifosine is cytotoxic to CLL cells in vitro, and largely induces stabilized disease in vivo, with an AKT-independent mechanism.","['Friedman, Daphne R', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Davis, Patricia H', 'Allgood, Sallie D', 'Matta, Karen M', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Chen, Youwei', 'Davis, Evan D', 'Volkheimer, Alicia D', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Sportelli, Peter', 'Weinberg, J Brice']","['Friedman DR', 'Lanasa MC', 'Davis PH', 'Allgood SD', 'Matta KM', 'Brander DM', 'Chen Y', 'Davis ED', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Moore JO', 'Gockerman JP', 'Sportelli P', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center , Durham, NC , USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130831,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.824080 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 May;55(5):1067-75. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.824080.

They are non selective cation channels implicated in Ca(2+) signaling in hematologic tumor cells. Here, we review the growing experimental evidence indicating that TRP channels should be included among the genes whose expression is altered in hematologic malignancies such as leukemias (AML, ALL, CML and CLL), B- and T-lymphomas and multiple myelomas (MM). These effects depend on the widespread roles played by the TRP channels in the modulation of the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the hematopoietic cells. The analysis of the expression of the different TRP channels belonging to the TRPMs, TRPVs, TRPCs, TRPPs channel families expressed in different hematological malignacies, evidenced a widespread expression of TRPV2 channel in the myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, and a very peculiar expression of this channel in different types of B cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma, that is parallel to the restricted expression of TRPV2 in normal immune cells with respect to its presence in other human tissues. In vivo studies in children AML and ALL patients also evidenced the presence of a genetic polymorphism of the TRPM5 gene, that reduced the risk to develop leukemia in the children. Finally, the coexpression of TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels in lymphocytes, and their involvement in the radioresistance of K562 erythroleukemia cells to ionizing radiation exposure is of more interest. Thus in conclusion, the TRP channels represent promising targets for hematologic cancer therapy, and their exploitation may open to novel pharmaceutical and clinical approaches.","['Morelli, Maria B', 'Liberati, Sonia', 'Amantini, Consuelo', 'Nabiss, Massimo', 'Santoni, Matteo', 'Farfariello, Valerio', 'Santoni, Giorgio']","['Morelli MB', 'Liberati S', 'Amantini C', 'Nabiss M', 'Santoni M', 'Farfariello V', 'Santoni G']","['School of Pharmacy, Section of Experimental Medicine, University of Camerino, Via Madonna delle Carceri 9, 62032 Camerino (MC), Italy. giorgio.santoni@unicam.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Mol Pharmacol,Current molecular pharmacology,101467997,['0 (Transient Receptor Potential Channels)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Discovery', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Transient Receptor Potential Channels/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['CMP-EPUB-53824 [pii]', '10.2174/187446720603140415215431 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Nov;6(3):137-48. doi: 10.2174/187446720603140415215431.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we cloned hLIF into the pENTR-D/ TOPO entry vector by a TOPO reaction. Next, hLIF was subcloned into the pDEST17 destination vector by the LR reaction, which resulted in the production of a construct that was transferred into E. coli strain Rosetta-gami 2(DE3) pLacI competent cells to produce the His6-hLIF fusion protein. RESULTS: This straightforward method produced a biologically active recombinant hLIF protein in E. coli that has long-term storage ability. This procedure has provided rapid, cost effective purification of a soluble hLIF protein that is biologically active and functional as measured in mouse ESCs and iPSCs in vitro.

We previously reported that inhibition of SMO or GLI prevents osteosarcoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Recently, it has been reported that arsenic trioxide (ATO) inhibits cancer growth by blocking GLI transcription. In this study, we analyzed the function of ATO in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Real-time PCR showed that ATO decreased the expression of Hedgehog target genes, including PTCH1, GLI1, and GLI2, in human osteosarcoma cell lines. WST-1 assay and colony formation assay revealed that ATO prevented osteosarcoma growth. These findings show that ATO prevents GLI transcription and osteosarcoma growth in vitro. Flow cytometric analysis showed that ATO promoted apoptotic cell death. Comet assay showed that ATO treatment increased accumulation of DNA damage. Western blot analysis showed that ATO treatment increased the expression of gammaH2AX, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3. In addition, ATO treatment decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These findings suggest that ATO treatment promoted apoptotic cell death caused by accumulation of DNA damage. In contrast, Sonic Hedgehog treatment decreased the expression of gammaH2AX induced by cisplatin treatment. ATO re-induced the accumulation of DNA damage attenuated by Sonic Hedgehog treatment. These findings suggest that ATO inhibits the activation of Hedgehog signaling and promotes apoptotic cell death in osteosarcoma cells by accumulation of DNA damage. Finally, examination of mouse xenograft models showed that ATO administration prevented the growth of osteosarcoma in nude mice.

Drug resistance, severe side effects, and relapse are major problems of currently used drugs, and new candidate compounds are required for improvement of therapy success. The naphthoquinone shikonin derived from the Chinese medicinal herb, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, is a promising candidate for the next generation of chemotherapy. The basal cellular mechanism of shikonin is the direct targeting of mitochondria. Cytotoxicity screenings showed that the compound is particularly effective against leukemia cells suggesting an additional cellular mechanism. mRNA and miRNA microarrays were used to analyze changes in gene expression in leukemia cells after shikonin treatment and combined with stable-isotope dimethyl labeling for quantitative proteomics. The integration of bioinformatics and the three ""-omics"" assays showed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway was affected by shikonin. Deregulations of this pathway are frequently associated with cancerogenesis, especially in a wide range of hematological malignancies. The effect on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis was validated by demonstrating a decreased phosphorylation of Akt and a direct inhibition of the IGF1R kinase activity after shikonin treatment. Our results indicate that inhibiting the IGF1R-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade is a new cellular mechanism of shikonin strengthening its potential for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Wiench, Benjamin', 'Chen, Yet-Ran', 'Paulsen, Malte', 'Hamm, Rebecca', 'Schroder, Sven', 'Yang, Ning-Sun', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Wiench B', 'Chen YR', 'Paulsen M', 'Hamm R', 'Schroder S', 'Yang NS', 'Efferth T']","['Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130619,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC3703888,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/07/19 06:01,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/818709 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:818709. doi: 10.1155/2013/818709.

Whereas the original E. coli isolate was resistant to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (EC1), the relapse E. coli isolate showed a similar phenotype but with resistance extended to ceftazidime (EC2). We investigated the molecular mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance and sought if EC2 could have been selected in vivo from EC1. METHODS: EC1 and EC2 isolates were compared for antibiotic MICs, plasmid content, genotyping, beta-lactamase genes and their environment. Both isolates were conjugated with E. coli JW4111DeltaampC and MICs determined for transconjugants. In addition, ceftazidime-resistant mutants were selected in vitro from EC1. RESULTS: EC1 and EC2 showed identical patterns for genotyping and resistance plasmids. PCR sequencing of blaTEM in EC1 showed the mutations M69L and N276D corresponding to TEM-35, also called inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-4. In EC2, the TEM allele showed an additional mutation, R164S, known to confer resistance to ceftazidime. The combination of these three mutations was previously reported in TEM-158, described as the complex mutant TEM (CMT)-9, associated with resistance to beta-lactamase inhibitors and third-generation cephalosporins. In vitro selection of ceftazidime-resistant mutants from EC1 yielded six different CMT alleles, including TEM-158 containing the R164S mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This first known report of in vivo selection of CMT from IRT, reproduced in vitro, shows how the evolution of beta-lactamase enzymes is easily driven by antibiotic pressure, even during a short antibiotic therapy.","['Jacquier, H', 'Marcade, G', 'Raffoux, E', 'Dombret, H', 'Woerther, P L', 'Donay, J L', 'Arlet, G', 'Cambau, E']","['Jacquier H', 'Marcade G', 'Raffoux E', 'Dombret H', 'Woerther PL', 'Donay JL', 'Arlet G', 'Cambau E']","['APHP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Service de Bacteriologie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130716,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (beta-Lactamase Inhibitors)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ceftazidime/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Typing', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics', 'Plasmids/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Selection, Genetic', '*beta-Lactamase Inhibitors', 'beta-Lactamases/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['antibiotic pressure', 'evolution of antibiotic resistance', 'neutropenic sepsis', 'third-generation cephalosporins', 'beta-lactamases']",2013/07/19 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['dkt278 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkt278 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Dec;68(12):2792-6. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkt278.

However, alterations to treatment strategies using available drugs are unlikely to provide significant improvement in survival or decrease therapy-associated toxicities. Here, we report ectopic expression of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase in pre-B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cell lines and pediatric patient samples. Inhibition of Mer in B-ALL cell lines decreased activation of AKT and MAPKs and led to transcriptional changes, including decreased expression of antiapoptotic PRKCB gene and increase in proapoptotic BAX and BBC3 genes. Further, Mer inhibition promoted chemosensitization, decreased colony-forming potential in clonogenic assays, and delayed disease onset in a mouse xenograft model of leukemia. Our results identify Mer as a potential therapeutic target in B-ALL and suggest that inhibitors of Mer may potentiate lymphoblast killing when used in combination with chemotherapy. This strategy could reduce minimal residual disease and/or allow for chemotherapy dose reduction, thereby leading to improved event-free survival and reduced therapy-associated toxicity for patients with B-ALL. Additionally, Mer is aberrantly expressed in numerous other malignancies suggesting that this approach may have broad applications.","['Linger, Rachel M A', 'Lee-Sherick, Alisa B', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Cohen, Rebecca A', 'Jacobsen, Kristen M', 'McGranahan, Amy', 'Brandao, Luis N', 'Winges, Amanda', 'Sawczyn, Kelly K', 'Liang, Xiayuan', 'Keating, Amy K', 'Tan, Aik Choon', 'Earp, H Shelton', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Linger RM', 'Lee-Sherick AB', 'DeRyckere D', 'Cohen RA', 'Jacobsen KM', 'McGranahan A', 'Brandao LN', 'Winges A', 'Sawczyn KK', 'Liang X', 'Keating AK', 'Tan AC', 'Earp HS', 'Graham DK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130716,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MERTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase']",PMC3757372,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53539-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-478156 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 29;122(9):1599-609. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-478156.

However, the relationship between its activity with clinico-biological prognosticators has been addressed only in few studies. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of bendamustine, in a real-life contest, on 142 patients, median age 70 years, median number of previous regimens 2 (0-8, 13% previously untreated). Bendamustine was administered for a median number of 4 cycles, in 84% of cases with rituximab. Overall (ORR) and complete response (CRR) rates were 68 and 16.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a relationship between ORR and number of prior treatments (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.71; P = 0.009), del(17p) (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.32; P < 0.001) and concomitant rituximab (OR 4.37, 95% CI 1.12-17.04; P = 0.033).

The authors determined the frequency of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis and their relationship with doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Peripheral blood was tested for 2 common HFE allelic variants: C282Y and H63D. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are biomarkers of cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively, were assayed during therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed with echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients had DNA results for at least 1 variant, and 167 had DNA results for both: 24% carried H63D and 10% carried C282Y. Heterozygous C282Y genotype was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations (P = .039), but not NT-proBNP. At a median of 2.2 years (range, 1.0 years-3.6 years) after diagnosis, the mean Z-scores for LV fractional shortening (-0.71 [standard error (SE), 0.25]; P = .008), mass (-0.84 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001), and end-systolic (-4.36 [SE, 0.26], P < .001) and end-diastolic (-0.68 [SE, 0.25]; P = .01) posterior wall thickness were found to be abnormal in children with either allele (n = 32). Noncarriers (n = 63) also were found to have below-normal LV mass (-0.45 [SE, 0.15]; P = .006) and end-systolic posterior wall thickness (-4.06 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001). Later follow-up demonstrated similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with C282Y HFE carriers.

We checked mutation status of the U2AF1 by direct sequencing in 478 de novo MDS patients and correlated with the clinical characteristics and outcomes. We also sequentially analyzed the U2AF1 mutation in 421 samples from 142 patients to determine its stability during the disease courses. Thirty-six patients (7.5%) were found to have U2AF1 mutations, which occurred more frequently in younger patients (P = 0.033). U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor-risk factor for overall survival (OS) in all patients (P = 0.030) and younger patients (P = 0.041). U2AF1 mutation could also predict shorter time-to-leukemia transformation (TTL) in younger patients (P = 0.020). In addition, U2AF1 mutation was associated with shorter TTL in lower-risk MDS patients. Sequential analyses showed all original U2AF1 mutations in U2AF1-mutated patients were retained during follow-ups unless complete remission was achieved, whereas none of the U2AF1-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution. U2AF1 mutation is more prevalent in younger MDS patients and associated with inferior outcomes although it is stable during the clinical course. The mutation may be used as a biomarker for risk stratification.","['Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Li, Li-Yu', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Lai, Yen-Jun', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wu SJ', 'Tang JL', 'Lin CT', 'Kuo YY', 'Li LY', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Lai YJ', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Hou HA', 'Chen CY', 'Chou WC', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Tsay W', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Splicing Factor U2AF', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23541 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Nov;88(11):E277-82. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23541.

NOTCH1 mutations are known to be more prevalent among +12 patients, whereas mutations of FBXW7, a gene involved in NOTCH1 degradation, that lead to the constitutional activation of NOTCH1 have not been investigated in this setting. We analyzed a unicentric cohort of 44 +12 patients with CLL for mutations of TP53, NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes, and we correlated them with B-cell receptor (BCR) configurations. FBXW7, TP53 and NOTCH1 mutations were identified in 4.5%, 6.8% and 18.2% of patients, respectively. FBXW7 and NOTCH1 mutations appeared in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that both aberrations might affect the same biological pathway. We found that 44.1% of +12 CLL patients had stereotyped B-cell receptors, which is significantly higher than that observed in patients with CLL and no +12 (27%, p = 0.01). Subsets #1, #8, #10, #28 and #59 were the most represented stereotyped patterns, and IGHV4-39*01 was the gene configuration most commonly used. There was a significantly higher risk for Richter's syndrome (RS) transformation in patients with NOTCH1 or FBXW7 mutations, with four of the seven (57%) patients developing RS and characterized at least by one of the two abnormalities. These observations suggest that, similarly to the aberrations of NOTCH1, FBXW7 gene mutations may also result in cell proliferation and evasion from apoptosis in patients with +12 CLL. Together with the extremely high frequency of stereotyped BCRs and RS transformation, these abnormalities appear to cluster in these CLL patients with additional chromosome 12, suggesting a connection with the prognosis of the disease.","['Falisi, Erika', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Guercini, Nicola', 'Maura, Francesco', 'Giaretta, Ilaria', 'Pomponi, Fabrizio', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Finotto, Silvia', 'Montaldi, Annamaria', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco']","['Falisi E', 'Novella E', 'Visco C', 'Guercini N', 'Maura F', 'Giaretta I', 'Pomponi F', 'Nichele I', 'Finotto S', 'Montaldi A', 'Neri A', 'Rodeghiero F']","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, S.

Contrary to earlier assumptions, it is now clear that both PTKs and PTPs are highly specific, non-redundant, and tightly regulated enzymes. Hematopoietic cells express particularly high numbers of PTKs and PTPs, and aberrant function of these proteins have been linked to many hematopoietic disorders. While PTK inhibitors are among FDA approved drugs for the treatment of leukemia and other cancers, efforts to develop therapeutics that target specific PTPs are still in its infancy. Here, we describe methods on how to evaluate effects of PTP inhibitors on T cell receptor signaling. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive strategy for compound prioritization, applicable to any drug discovery project involving T cells. We present a testing funnel that starts with relatively high-throughput luciferase reporter assays, followed by immunoblot, calcium flux, flow cytometry, and proliferation assays, continues with cytokine bead arrays, and finishes with specificity assays that involve RNA interference.

However, there has been no consistent approach to JAK2-V617F detection, with assays varying markedly in performance, affecting clinical utility. Therefore, we established a network of 12 laboratories from seven countries to systematically evaluate nine different DNA-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, including those in widespread clinical use. Seven quality control rounds involving over 21,500 qPCR reactions were undertaken using centrally distributed cell line dilutions and plasmid controls. The two best-performing assays were tested on normal blood samples (n=100) to evaluate assay specificity, followed by analysis of serial samples from 28 patients transplanted for JAK2-V617F-positive disease. The most sensitive assay, which performed consistently across a range of qPCR platforms, predicted outcome following transplant, with the mutant allele detected a median of 22 weeks (range 6-85 weeks) before relapse. Four of seven patients achieved molecular remission following donor lymphocyte infusion, indicative of a graft vs MPN effect. This study has established a robust, reliable assay for sensitive JAK2-V617F detection, suitable for assessing response in clinical trials, predicting outcome and guiding management of patients undergoing allogeneic transplant.","['Jovanovic, J V', 'Ivey, A', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Lippert, E', 'Oppliger Leibundgut, E', 'Cassinat, B', 'Pallisgaard, N', 'Maroc, N', 'Hermouet, S', 'Nickless, G', 'Guglielmelli, P', 'van der Reijden, B A', 'Jansen, J H', 'Alpermann, T', 'Schnittger, S', 'Bench, A', 'Tobal, K', 'Wilkins, B', 'Cuthill, K', 'McLornan, D', 'Yeoman, K', 'Akiki, S', 'Bryon, J', 'Jeffries, S', 'Jones, A', 'Percy, M J', 'Schwemmers, S', 'Gruender, A', 'Kelley, T W', 'Reading, S', 'Pancrazzi, A', 'McMullin, M F', 'Pahl, H L', 'Cross, N C P', 'Harrison, C N', 'Prchal, J T', 'Chomienne, C', 'Kiladjian, J J', 'Barbui, T', 'Grimwade, D']","['Jovanovic JV', 'Ivey A', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Lippert E', 'Oppliger Leibundgut E', 'Cassinat B', 'Pallisgaard N', 'Maroc N', 'Hermouet S', 'Nickless G', 'Guglielmelli P', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Alpermann T', 'Schnittger S', 'Bench A', 'Tobal K', 'Wilkins B', 'Cuthill K', 'McLornan D', 'Yeoman K', 'Akiki S', 'Bryon J', 'Jeffries S', 'Jones A', 'Percy MJ', 'Schwemmers S', 'Gruender A', 'Kelley TW', 'Reading S', 'Pancrazzi A', 'McMullin MF', 'Pahl HL', 'Cross NC', 'Harrison CN', 'Prchal JT', 'Chomienne C', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Barbui T', 'Grimwade D']","[""King's College London School of Medicine, Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC3806250,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013219 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.219 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2032-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.219.

A comparative analysis with flow cytometry.,391-7,10.1038/leu.2013.217 [doi],"We have analyzed the applicability, sensitivity and prognostic value of allele-specific oligonucleotide real-time quantitative PCR (ASO RQ-PCR) as a method for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), comparing the results with those of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). A total of 170 patients enrolled in three consecutive Spanish trials achieving at least partial response after treatment were included. Lack of clonality detection (n=31), unsuccessful sequencing (n=17) and suboptimal ASO performance (n=51) limited the applicability of PCR to 42% of cases. MRD was finally investigated in 103 patients (including 32 previously studied) with persistent disease identified by PCR and MFC in 54% and 46% of cases, respectively. A significant correlation in MRD quantitation by both the techniques was noted (r=0.881, P<0.001), being reflective of treatment intensity. Patients with <10(-4) residual tumor cells showed longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared with the rest (not reached (NR) vs 31 months, P=0.002), with similar results observed with MFC. Among complete responders (n=62), PCR discriminated two risk groups with different PFS (49 vs 26 months, P=0.001) and overall survival (NR vs 60 months, P=0.008). Thus, although less applicable than MFC, ASO RQ-PCR is a powerful technique to assess treatment efficacy and risk stratification in MM.","['Puig, N', 'Sarasquete, M E', 'Balanzategui, A', 'Martinez, J', 'Paiva, B', 'Garcia, H', 'Fumero, S', 'Jimenez, C', 'Alcoceba, M', 'Chillon, M C', 'Sebastian, E', 'Marin, L', 'Montalban, M A', 'Mateos, M V', 'Oriol, A', 'Palomera, L', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Blade, J', 'Lahuerta, J J', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Miguel, J F S', 'Garcia-Sanz, R']","['Puig N', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Balanzategui A', 'Martinez J', 'Paiva B', 'Garcia H', 'Fumero S', 'Jimenez C', 'Alcoceba M', 'Chillon MC', 'Sebastian E', 'Marin L', 'Montalban MA', 'Mateos MV', 'Oriol A', 'Palomera L', 'de la Rubia J', 'Vidriales MB', 'Blade J', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Gonzalez M', 'Miguel JF', 'Garcia-Sanz R']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico 'Lozano Blesa', Zaragoza, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe and Universidad Catolica 'San Vicente Martir', Valencia, Spain."", 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic I Provincial, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca; IBSAL; IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,,2013/07/19 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013217 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.217 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Feb;28(2):391-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.217.

The 30-item Therapy-Related Symptom Checklist for Children (TRSC-C) has good measurement and psychometric properties and uses ""kid-friendly"" terms to monitor symptom occurrence and severity during oncology treatment. A secondary analysis is reported using participants who self-identified as Hispanic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine among Hispanic pediatric oncology outpatients (a) occurrence and (b) severity of symptoms reported on the TRSC-C, (c) relationships of symptoms to gender and age (<12 vs >/=12), and (d) differences in summated TRSC-C symptom scores between patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other diagnoses. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional analysis using secondary data and descriptive statistics. SAMPLE: The sample was composed of 79 children (55% male) aged 5 to 17 years (mean, 10.3 years) with diagnosis of ALL (52%) or other (48%). Instrument used was TRSC-C by patient/parent report (Cronbach's alpha = .91). RESULTS: (a) Symptom occurrence: 15 symptoms on the TRSC-C were reported by 40% or greater. (b) Severity means on 11 symptoms were greater than ""a little bit."" (c) No gender or age differences were found on mean TRSC-C summated scores. (d) Mean TRSC-C scores (symptom occurrence and severity) were slightly lower but not significantly different (t = 1.71) between ALL (13.71 [SD, 8.06]) and other diagnoses (15.71 [SD, 7.01]). CONCLUSION: Symptom occurrence and severity reported on the TRSC-C by this Hispanic subsample are consistent with findings in the calibration study and with those of another Hispanic group and other ethnicities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Use of the TRSC-C is appropriate during pediatric oncology treatment and diagnoses of Hispanic populations.","['Williams, Phoebe D', 'Robinson, Jane', 'Williams, Arthur R']","['Williams PD', 'Robinson J', 'Williams AR']","['Author Affiliations: School of Nursing, University of Kansas, Kansas City (Dr P.

Five of 7 reported cases describe SCFE in children shortly after GnRHa therapy cessation. METHODS: We report 3 cases of SCFE that occurred in children on GnRHa therapy for the treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP) and discuss possible promoting factors. RESULTS: An otherwise healthy 8.75-year-old girl [body mass index (BMI) Z score +1.75] developed SCFE 6.75 years into GnRHa therapy for idiopathic CPP. A second girl (with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia requiring total body irradiation) was 10.6 years old (BMI Z score +1.06) when she developed SCFE 3.3 years into GnRHa therapy. The third case was an 8.75-year-old female with CPP secondary to a hypothalamic hamartoma (BMI Z score +1.65) who developed bilateral SCFE 5.6 years into therapy. CONCLUSION: Increasing evidence suggests an association between GnRHa therapy for CPP and the occurrence of SCFE. We suggest that a lack of adequate sex hormone exposure at a 'critical period' of bone formation may result in a weakened epiphysis that becomes susceptible to slipping. (c) 2013 S.

This study assesses whether an ethnic influence has an effect on the frequency of any of the four fusion genes: BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and MLL-AFF1 found in ALL. To study this ethnic influence, mononuclear cells were obtained from bone marrow samples from 143 patients with ALL. We performed RNA extraction and reverse transcription, then assessed the quality of the cDNA by amplifying the ABL1 control gene, and finally evaluated the presence of the four transcripts by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found 10 patients who had the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (7%); 3 patients (2%) were TCF3-PBX1 positive; and 6 patients (4.5%) were ETV6-RUNX1 positive.

The low incidence of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene found in Guatemala matches the incidence rates that have been reported in Spain and Indian Romani.

This study examined the association between atomic bomb radiation and the incidence of prostate cancer among male Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. The subjects were classified by distance from the hypocenter into a proximal group (<2 km), a distal group (>/=2 km), and an early entrance group (those who entered the region <2 km from the hypocenter within 2 weeks after the explosion). Between 1996 and 2009, 631 new cases of prostate cancer were identified among approximately 18 400 male Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors who were alive in 1996. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the risk of prostate cancer development, with adjustment for age at atomic bomb explosion, attained age, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Compared with the distal group, the proximal group had significant increased risks of total, localized, and high-grade prostate cancer (relative risk and 95% confidence interval: 1.51 [1.21-1.89]; 1.80 [1.26-2.57]; and 1.88 [1.20-2.94], respectively).

To better understand the mechanisms underlying EVI1-associated disease, we sought to define the EVI1 interactome in cancer cells. By using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics, we could confidently assign 78 proteins as EVI1-interacting partners for FLAG-tagged EVI1. Subsequently, we showed that 22 of 27 tested interacting proteins could coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous EVI1 protein, which represented an 81.5% validation rate. Additionally, by comparing the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) data with high-throughput yeast two hybrid results, we showed that five of these proteins interacted directly with EVI1. Functional classification of EVI1-interacting proteins revealed associations with cellular transcription machinery; modulators of transcription; components of WNT, TGF-beta, and RAS pathways; and proteins regulating DNA repair, recombination, and mitosis. We also identified EVI1 phosphorylation sites by MS analysis and showed that Ser538 and Ser858 can be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by two EVI1 interactome proteins, casein kinase II and protein phosphatase-1alpha. Finally, mutations that impair EVI1 phosphorylation at these sites reduced EVI1 DNA binding through its C-terminal zinc finger domain and induced cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, these combinatorial proteomic approaches demonstrate that EVI1 interacts with large and complex networks of proteins, which integrate signals from various different signaling pathways important for oncogenesis. Comprehensive analysis of the EVI1 interactome has thus provided an important resource for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of EVI1-associated disease.","['Bard-Chapeau, Emilie A', 'Gunaratne, Jayantha', 'Kumar, Pankaj', 'Chua, Belinda Q', 'Muller, Julius', 'Bard, Frederic A', 'Blackstock, Walter', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A']","['Bard-Chapeau EA', 'Gunaratne J', 'Kumar P', 'Chua BQ', 'Muller J', 'Bard FA', 'Blackstock W', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA']","['Cancer Genetics Group, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130715,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', '*Mitosis', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', '*Recombinational DNA Repair', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",PMC3732971,['NOTNLM'],"['EVI1 complex locus mass spectrometry', 'MDS1']",2013/07/17 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1309310110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1309310110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 30;110(31):E2885-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1309310110.

The knowledge of the mechanisms that induce sarcopenia and the ability to prevent or counteract them, therefore, can greatly contribute to the prevention of disability and probably also mortality in the elderly.

While most PD is sporadic in nature, a significant subset can be linked to either dominant or recessive germ line mutations. PARK2, encoding the ubiquitin ligase parkin, is the most frequently mutated gene in hereditary Parkinson's disease. Here, we present evidence for a neuronal ubiquitin ligase cascade involving parkin and the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase SCF(Fbw7beta). Specifically, parkin targets the SCF substrate adapter Fbw7beta for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, we show that the physiological role of parkin-mediated regulation of Fbw7beta levels is the stabilization of the mitochondrial prosurvival factor Mcl-1, an SCF(Fbw7beta) target in neurons. We show that neurons depleted of parkin become acutely sensitive to oxidative stress due to an inability to maintain adequate levels of Mcl-1. Therefore, loss of parkin function through biallelic mutation of PARK2 may lead to death of dopaminergic neurons through unregulated SCF(Fbw7beta)-mediated ubiquitylation-dependent proteolysis of Mcl-1.","['Ekholm-Reed, Susanna', 'Goldberg, Matthew S', 'Schlossmacher, Michael G', 'Reed, Steven I']","['Ekholm-Reed S', 'Goldberg MS', 'Schlossmacher MG', 'Reed SI']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130715,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (Fbxw7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (parkin protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'F-Box Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3753862,,,2013/07/17 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00535-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00535-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Sep;33(18):3627-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00535-13.

The most dynamically regulated miRNA was miR-223, which is bound at its promoter and up-regulated by the TAL1 complex. miR-223 expression mirrors TAL1 levels during thymic development, with high expression in early thymocytes and marked down-regulation after the double-negative-2 stage of maturation. We demonstrate that aberrant miR-223 up-regulation by TAL1 is important for optimal growth of TAL1-positive T-ALL cells and that sustained expression of miR-223 partially rescues T-ALL cells after TAL1 knockdown. Overexpression of miR-223 also leads to marked down-regulation of FBXW7 protein expression, whereas knockdown of TAL1 leads to up-regulation of FBXW7 protein levels, with a marked reduction of its substrates MYC, MYB, NOTCH1, and CYCLIN E. We conclude that TAL1-mediated up-regulation of miR-223 promotes the malignant phenotype in T-ALL through repression of the FBXW7 tumor suppressor.","['Mansour, Marc R', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Lawton, Lee N', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Kreslavsky, Taras', 'Novina, Carl D', 'Brand, Marjorie', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Kelliher, Michelle A', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'von Boehmer, Harald', 'Young, Richard A', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Mansour MR', 'Sanda T', 'Lawton LN', 'Li X', 'Kreslavsky T', 'Novina CD', 'Brand M', 'Gutierrez A', 'Kelliher MA', 'Jamieson CH', 'von Boehmer H', 'Young RA', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130715,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3727321,,,2013/07/17 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20122516 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20122516 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Jul 29;210(8):1545-57. doi: 10.1084/jem.20122516.

This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of this protocol in children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), irrespective of histopathologic subtype. PROCEDURE: From January 1996 to December 2011, 146 newly diagnosed children and adolescents with NHL were treated with the modified New York protocol. Treatment duration was determined according to the stage. RESULTS: The 5-year failure-free survival (FFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86.7 +/- 2.9%, 79.1 +/- 3.5%, and 84.7 +/- 3.1%, respectively. The 5-year FFS for patients with mature B-cell lymphoma, T-cell and NK-cell lymphoma (T/NK-cell lymphoma), and lymphoblastic lymphoma were 95.4 +/- 2.6%, 76.1 +/- 7.0%, and 82.1 +/- 6.6%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, T/NK-cell lymphoma and non-complete response (non-CR) at the end of induction chemotherapy were associated with a significant increase in treatment failure rate (relative risk [RR], 4.5, P = 0.03, and RR, 5.0, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The protocol appears to be efficacious in the treatment of children and adolescents with NHL, irrespective of histopathologic subtype. Achievement of CR after intensive induction chemotherapy was an important prognostic factor. Early response to treatment may be used to stratify risk groups and modify therapy in children with NHL.","['Lee, Soo Hyun', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Ko, Young Hyeh', 'Lee, Jung Won', 'Koo, Hong Hoe']","['Lee SH', 'Yoo KH', 'Sung KW', 'Ko YH', 'Lee JW', 'Koo HH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130716,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['New York protocol', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'survival']",2013/07/17 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24695 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Nov;60(11):1842-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24695.

Boutique arrays, which are small, spotted, dedicated microarrays, constitute an inexpensive alternative to whole-genome screening methods. The data extracted from each microarray-based experiment must be transformed and processed prior to further analysis to eliminate any technical bias. The normalization of the data is the most crucial step of microarray data pre-processing and this process must be carefully considered as it has a profound effect on the results of the analysis. Several normalization algorithms have been developed and implemented in data analysis software packages. However, most of these methods were designed for whole-genome analysis. In this study, we tested 13 normalization strategies (ten for double-channel data and three for single-channel data) available on R Bioconductor and compared their effectiveness in the normalization of four boutique array datasets. The results revealed that boutique arrays can be successfully normalized using standard methods, but not every method is suitable for each dataset. We also suggest a universal seven-step workflow that can be applied for the selection of the optimal normalization procedure for any boutique array dataset. The described workflow enables the evaluation of the investigated normalization methods based on the bias and variance values for the control probes, a differential expression analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The analysis of each component results in a separate ranking of the normalization methods. A combination of the ranks obtained from all the normalization procedures facilitates the selection of the most appropriate normalization method for the studied dataset and determines which methods can be used interchangeably.","['Uszczynska, Barbara', 'Zyprych-Walczak, Joanna', 'Handschuh, Luiza', 'Szabelska, Alicja', 'Kazmierczak, Maciej', 'Woronowicz, Wieslawa', 'Kozlowski, Piotr', 'Sikorski, Michal M', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Siatkowski, Idzi', 'Figlerowicz, Marek']","['Uszczynska B', 'Zyprych-Walczak J', 'Handschuh L', 'Szabelska A', 'Kazmierczak M', 'Woronowicz W', 'Kozlowski P', 'Sikorski MM', 'Komarnicki M', 'Siatkowski I', 'Figlerowicz M']","['Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130715,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",,,,2013/07/17 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2013.1443 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2013 Sep;32(3):668-84. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1443.

Unsupervised affinity propagation clustering of the metabolic footprints yielded five distinct clusters that grouped the investigated cell cultures mainly according to the tissue of origin. A common expected feature of all neoplastic cells was high lactate production. Extracellular arginine and nicotinamide were major discriminants between normal and neoplastic hepatocytes.

In this work, we used a chimeric recombinant protein strategy to test the possibility of irreversibly destroying the HIV-1 virion using an agent that simultaneously binds the Env protein and viral membrane. We constructed a fusion of the lectin cyanovirin-N (CVN) and the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) peptide with a variable-length (Gly4Ser)x linker (where x is 4 or 8) between the C terminus of the former and N terminus of the latter. The His-tagged recombinant proteins, expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration, were found to display a nanomolar efficacy in blocking BaL-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection of HOS.T4.R5 cells. This antiviral activity was HIV-1 specific, since it did not inhibit cell infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or amphotropic-murine leukemia virus. Importantly, the chimeric proteins were found to release intraviral p24 protein from both BaL-pseudotyped HIV-1 and fully infectious BaL HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of host cells. The addition of either MPER or CVN was found to outcompete this virolytic effect, indicating that both components of the chimera are required for virolysis. The finding that engaging the Env protein spike and membrane using a chimeric ligand can destabilize the virus and lead to inactivation opens up a means to investigate virus particle metastability and to evaluate this approach for inactivation at the earliest stages of exposure to virus and before host cell encounter.","['Contarino, Mark', 'Bastian, Arangassery R', 'Kalyana Sundaram, Ramalingam Venkat', 'McFadden, Karyn', 'Duffy, Caitlin', 'Gangupomu, Vamshi', 'Baker, Michelle', 'Abrams, Cameron', 'Chaiken, Irwin']","['Contarino M', 'Bastian AR', 'Kalyana Sundaram RV', 'McFadden K', 'Duffy C', 'Gangupomu V', 'Baker M', 'Abrams C', 'Chaiken I']","['Drexel University College of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130715,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '184539-38-6 (cyanovirin N)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3811417,,,2013/07/17 06:00,2014/04/10 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.00309-13 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00309-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Oct;57(10):4743-50. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00309-13.

For MTC therapy, the Food and Drug Administration recently approved vandetanib and cabozantinib, multi-kinase inhibitors targeting RET and other tyrosine kinase receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor. Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity. Previously, we reported that expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, can induce growth arrest and RET downregulation via a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated autocrine/paracrine loop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice. These results suggest that LIF is a potent cytostatic agent for MTC cells, which regulates unique mechanisms that are not targeted by currently available therapeutic agents.","['Starenki, Dmytro', 'Singh, Nishant K', 'Jensen, Davin R', 'Peterson, Francis C', 'Park, Jong-In']","['Starenki D', 'Singh NK', 'Jensen DR', 'Peterson FC', 'Park JI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'Thyroid cancer, medullary']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/metabolism', '*Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3771534,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MALDI-TOF', 'MEN', 'MTC', 'Medullary thyroid carcinoma', 'PBS', 'RET', 'STAT3', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight', 'medullary thyroid carcinoma', 'multiple endocrine neoplasia', 'phosphate-buffered saline', 'rearranged during transfection']",2013/07/17 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(13)00511-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2013.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Oct 1;339(1):144-51. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.07.006.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of BZL on the growth of the leukemic cell lines THP-1 and OCI/AML3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated cell proliferation by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT reduction as well as cell death by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. We assessed apoptosis by flow cytometry for detection of annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative cells, along with nuclear morphology by diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) staining. Western blot studies were performed to evaluate changes in cell cycle proteins in BZL-treated cells. RESULTS: BZL significantly reduced proliferation of both cell lines without inducing cell death. Likewise it produced no significant differences in apoptosis between treated cells and controls. In addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that BZL caused a larger number of THP-1 cells in G0/G1 phase and a smaller number of cells in S phase than controls. This was accompanied with an increase in the expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 and of cyclin D1, with no significant differences in the protein levels of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, cyclins E, A and B as compared to controls. CONCLUSION: BZL inhibits the proliferation of leukemic non-adherent cells by controlling cell cycle at G0/G1 cell phase through up-regulation of p27.","['Calvo, Karina Lucrecia', 'Ronco, Maria Teresa', 'Noguera, Nelida Ines', 'Garcia, Fabiana']","['Calvo KL', 'Ronco MT', 'Noguera NI', 'Garcia F']","['Instituto de Inmunologia, Facultad Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional Rosario, Rosario, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitroimidazoles)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'YC42NRJ1ZD (benzonidazole)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nitroimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Trypanocidal Agents/*pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/17 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923973.2013.811597 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2013 Aug;35(4):478-86. doi: 10.3109/08923973.2013.811597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nursing consultation involving cancer survivors might be beneficial for other patients as they successfully managed and lived with cancer. But controversies still exist in the research findings as how nursing consultation involving cancer survivors might influence other cancer patients' QoL. Therefore, a research study was done to determine the effect of nursing consultation with the presence of cancer survivors on cancer patients' QoL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a quasi-experimental research using a pre-post test design, which was conducted in Sayyed- AL-Shohada Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, in 2010. Twenty-two adult patients who suffered from acute leukemia who were receiving chemotherapy were selected. They participated in a nursing consultation group in which cancer survivors were actively engaged. The patients' QoL was assessed before, 1 week, and 1 month after the nursing consultation using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core-30 Version 3 (EORTC QLQ-C30-V3) questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparing QoL mean scores of patients in the symptom, performance, and the general health status scales showed that there was not any significant change in the QoL scores before, 1 week, and 1 month after the consultation. CONCLUSION: It seems that the nursing consultation with the presence of cancer survivors couldn't enhance patients' QoL, although it might prevent worsening the patients' QoL. Cancer has deleterious impacts on patients' QoL and nursing consultation may not improve QoL in a short period of time. It is recommended that the study be conducted with a larger sample, in a longer time and with a case-control design.","['Bahrami, Masoud', 'Parnian, Raziyeh', 'Samimi, Mozhgan Alam']","['Bahrami M', 'Parnian R', 'Samimi MA']","['Nursing and Midwifery Care Research Center, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Department of Adult Health Nursing, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,Iranian journal of nursing and midwifery research,101558775,,,,PMC3703073,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Iran', 'consultation', 'nursing', 'peer group', 'quality of life', 'survivor']",2013/07/16 06:00,2013/07/16 06:01,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res. 2012 Jul;17(5):338-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically, rapid and early diagnosis prevents IA progression. In this study we performed a Real Time PCR/ Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for diagnosis of IA in hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty two patients with hematologic malignancies and marrow transplant recipients were evaluated for IA in Sari and Tehran from 2009 to 2010. The primer and hybridization probe were designed to amplify the specific sequence of 18S rRNA genes using Light Cycler system and FRET. Galactomannan (GM) assay was performed on serums which obtained from selected patients using the Platelia Aspergillus kit. RESULTS: According to the criteria defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) for IA, 18 (29%) patients out of 62 patients were stratified into probable and possible groups. The female-to-male ratio was 1:2; the mean age of the patients was 36 years. The most common malignancies in these patients were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (38.9%). The minimum detection limit was 10 conidia (10(1) CFU/ml) equivalents (100 fg) per PCR reaction. GM assay was positive in 20.9% and real-time PCR probe set assay were positive in 17.7% patients who had clinical signs and host factor according to the mentioned criteria. CONCLUSION: Using the Real-Time PCR/FRET assay in whole blood specimens seems to be a promising method for diagnosis of IA, especially when used in combination with the GM detection test.","['Nabili, Mojtaba', 'Shokohi, Tahereh', 'Janbabaie, Ghasem', 'Hashemi-Soteh, Mohammad Bagher', 'Ali-Moghaddam, Kamran', 'Aghili, Seyed Reza']","['Nabili M', 'Shokohi T', 'Janbabaie G', 'Hashemi-Soteh MB', 'Ali-Moghaddam K', 'Aghili SR']","['Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Invasive Fungi Research Center, Sari, Iran ; Social Security Organization, Golestan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Glob Infect Dis,Journal of global infectious diseases,101521436,,,,PMC3703213,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological malignancy', 'Invasive aspergillosis', 'Real-Time PCR']",2013/07/16 06:00,2013/07/16 06:01,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-777X.112296 [doi]', 'JGID-5-68 [pii]']",ppublish,J Glob Infect Dis. 2013 Apr;5(2):68-75. doi: 10.4103/0974-777X.112296.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of tobacco smoke on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML), especially subtypes of prenatal origin such as ALL with translocation t(12;21) or high-hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes). METHODS: We collected information on exposures to tobacco smoking before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth in 767 ALL cases, 135 AML cases, and 1,139 controls (1996-2008). Among cases, chromosome translocations, deletions, or aneuploidy were identified by conventional karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Multivariable regression analyses for ALL and AML overall showed no definite evidence of associations with self-reported (yes/no) parental prenatal active smoking and child's passive smoking. However, children with history of paternal prenatal smoking combined with postnatal passive smoking had a 1.5-fold increased risk of ALL [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.23], compared to those without smoking history (ORs for pre- or postnatal smoking only were close to one). This joint effect was seen for B-cell precursor ALL with t(12;21) (OR = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.04-4.16), but not high hyperdiploid B-cell ALL. Similarly, child's passive smoking was associated with an elevated risk of AML with chromosome structural changes (OR = 2.76; 95% CI, 1.01-7.58), but not aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that exposure to tobacco smoking was associated with increased risks of childhood ALL and AML; and risks varied by timing of exposure (before and/or after birth) and cytogenetic subtype, based on imprecise estimates. IMPACT: Parents should limit exposures to tobacco smoke before and after the child's birth.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Bartley, Karen', 'Schiffman, Joshua', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Fu, Cecilia H', 'Ducore, Jonathan', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Metayer C', 'Zhang L', 'Wiemels JL', 'Bartley K', 'Schiffman J', 'Ma X', 'Aldrich MC', 'Chang JS', 'Selvin S', 'Fu CH', 'Ducore J', 'Smith MT', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA94704-7392, USA. cmetayer@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130712,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC3769478,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/06/12 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-13-0350 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0350 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Sep;22(9):1600-11. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0350.

Here, we provide evidence that depletion of MKL1 and 2 abolishes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft growth. Loss of the tumour suppressor deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and the subsequent activation of RhoA were prerequisites for MKL1/2 knockdown-mediated growth arrest. We identified oncogene-induced senescence as the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of MKL1/2 knockdown. MKL1/2 depletion resulted in Ras activation, elevated p16 expression and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in DLC1-deficient HCC cells. Interestingly, reconstitution of HuH7 HCC cells with DLC1 also induced senescence. Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of MKL1/2 knockdown in vivo revealed that systemic treatment of nude mice bearing HuH7 tumour xenografts with MKL1/2 siRNAs complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI) completely abolished tumour growth. The regression of the xenografts was associated with senescence. Importantly, PEI-complexed MKL1 siRNA alone was sufficient for complete abrogation of HCC xenograft growth.

In contrast to childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, there is still a lack of data concerning late morbidities among young adult (YA) cancer survivors. Thus, our aim was to investigate cardiac and vascular morbidity among early-onset cancer survivors with a special interest in YA cancer survivors. In a population-based setting, we explored the risk of cardiovascular disease in early-onset cancer survivors compared to healthy siblings. Patients diagnosed with cancer below 35 years of age since 1975 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry, and 5-year survivors were included in our study (N = 13,860). Information on cardiovascular morbidity was collected from the national hospital discharge registry. Compared to siblings, cancer survivors aged 0-19 and 20-34 at diagnosis had significantly elevated hazard ratios (HRs) for the studied outcomes: HR 13.5 (95% CI 8.9-20.4) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.8-4.6) for cardiomyopathy/cardiac insufficiency; HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.3-5.1) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.4-2.0) for atherosclerosis/brain vascular thrombosis; HR 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-6.5) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.1) for myocardial infarction/cardiac ischemia and HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.6) and 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) for cardiac arrhythmia. In both groups, depending on the outcome, the HR for adverse events was highest among lymphoma, brain tumor, leukemia and testicular malignancy survivors. Our results regarding late effects of childhood cancer survivors confirmed previous findings. Additionally, our study provides novel information concerning the YA cancer survivor population. Hence, our data may help in planning the risk-based long-term follow-up of early-onset cancer survivors.","['Kero, A E', 'Jarvela, L S', 'Arola, M', 'Malila, N', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, L M', 'Matomaki, J', 'Lahteenmaki, P M']","['Kero AE', 'Jarvela LS', 'Arola M', 'Malila N', 'Madanat-Harjuoja LM', 'Matomaki J', 'Lahteenmaki PM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130809,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Siblings', '*Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cardiovascular morbidity', 'early-onset cancer survivors', 'late effects']",2013/07/16 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28385 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Feb 1;134(3):664-73. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28385.

Active DC immunization protocols are quickly obtaining interest as an alternative therapeutic approach in acute myeloid leukemia patients. Despite apparent progress in DC-based immunotherapy, some discrepancies were reported in generating potent DCs and their source. In addition to monocytes, DCs can be differentiated from leukemic blasts of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (AML-DC) possessing the ability of stimulating anti-leukemic immune response. In this study, we differentiated peripheral blood blasts of 16 out of 20 AML patients in vitro in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 into immature AML-DC. Then, DCs matured using different combinations of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to obtain functional DCs as demonstrated by cell morphology, immunophenotype, and functional activity. Autologous cytotoxic T cell induction of matured DCs was evaluated in four patients and compared with immature counterparts. Our results showed that although the TLR3 agonist (Poly I:C) has a synergistic effect on the TLR4 agonist (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), the addition of the TLR7/8 agonist (R848) is necessary to reinforce the effect of LPS or LPS + POLY(I:C) to produce efficient DCs with the higher level of IL-12 (30 to 90 times). Such DCs activate allogeneic T cells and effectively prime autologous cytotoxic T cells in vitro. In contrast, FSL-1 as a TLR2/6 agonist has a negative effect on LPS + Poly(I:C) and LPS + R848 to produce IL-12. Thus, DCs prepared using a maturation mixture including a TLR7/8 agonist may be used as a potential tool for DC-based immunotherapy purposes in leukemic patients.","['Nourizadeh, Maryam', 'Masoumi, Farimah', 'Memarian, Ali', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Moazzeni, Seyed Mohammad', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Hadjati, Jamshid']","['Nourizadeh M', 'Masoumi F', 'Memarian A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Moazzeni SM', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Hadjati J']","['Immunology Department, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Poorsina Ave., 16 Azar St., Keshavarz Blvd., P.O.

Among 26 variables examined, the strongest predictor for poor collection was a platelet count <100 x 10(6)/l before mobilization (P<0.001). A subsequent aHCT was performed in 154 of the 221 patients. Sole use of HPC procured after aHCT in 86 patients was associated with delayed platelet recovery (P<0.001) and linked to development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-associated cytogenetic abnormalities (MDS-CA; P=0.027, odds ratio (OR) 10.34) and a tendency towards clinical MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML; P=0.091, OR 3.57). However, treatment-related mortality (P=0.766) and time to absolute neutrophil count recovery >/=0.5 x 10(9)/l (P=0.879) were similar to when a pre-aHCT graft was used. Indeed, adding HPC collected before any aHCT neutralized the risk of MDS-CA or MDS/AML.

In our study, enhanced expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Screening of a phage display peptide library using Biopanning and Rapid Analysis of Selective Interactive Ligands (BRASIL) identified a TLR2-binding peptide motif, Pep2. We show that the TLR2-binding peptide motif targeted and penetrated into leukemia cells in a TLR2-dependent manner. Moreover, a synthetic, chimeric peptide composed of the TLR2-binding motif linked to a programmed cell death-inducing sequence, D(KLAKLAK)2, induced apoptosis in AML cells with high TLR2 expression (TLR2(high)) but not in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells with low TLR2 expression (TLR2(low)). The antileukemia activity of this chimeric peptide was confirmed in leukemia patient samples and an animal model of myeloid leukemia, as the development of leukemia was significantly delayed in mice with TLR2(high) AML compared to TLR2(low) CML NOD/SCID mice.

The system is composed of nodes storing many small cells and thin vessels branching out from the nodes. Inside the vessel there are multiple subvessels. The PVS is found in and on most organs, including the brain, and interestingly inside some lymph and blood vessels. The PVS is normally difficult to visualize due to its semitransparent optical property and its small size, which may be the main reason why it was not discovered until recently. The diameter of primo vessels (PVs) is in the range of 20-50 mum and the size of a primo node (PN), 100-1,000 mum. The outermost layer of the PVS is more porous than that of blood or lymph capillary vessels, and the nuclei of the PVS endothelial cells are rod shaped. Important PVS properties reported are: in the fluid inside the PVS, there are cells presenting stem cell markers CD133, Oct4, and Nanog, which may imply that this system has a role in regeneration. Another very important finding is its potential relevance to cancer. According to results from an animal study using xenografts of various cancer types (lung, ovarian, skin, gastric cancer, and leukemia), as the tumor grows, the PVS is formed in a high density in the vicinity of the tumor. In addition, it was shown that PVs connect the primary and secondary tumors and that cancer cells were transported via the PVs in an active manner. In this report, we illustrated the formation of the PVS in breast cancer, and using the green fluorescent protein-expressing gastric cancer cell lines, we observed the cancer cell movement from the primary to the secondary sites during the cancer progression.","['Kang, Kyung A', 'Maldonado, Claudio', 'Perez-Aradia, Gustavo', 'An, Ping', 'Soh, Kwang-Sup']","['Kang KA', 'Maldonado C', 'Perez-Aradia G', 'An P', 'Soh KS']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. kyung.kang@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Nano Primo Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Nano Primo Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Vessels/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*blood supply/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-7411-1_39 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;789:289-296. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-7411-1_39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the potential chemopreventive effect of Chel A has not been explored. Here, we showed that Chel A treatment with various concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mumol/L) for 3 weeks could dramatically inhibit EGF-induced cell transformation in Cl41 cells (IC50 approximately 2.0 mumol/L). Also, coincubation of Cl41 cells with Chel A (2.0 and 4.0 mumol/L) for 48 hours could induce cell apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner. Mechanically, Chel A treatment could result in increased p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and elevated p53 total protein expression. Moreover, we found that p53 induction by Chel A was regulated at the protein degradation level, but not at either the transcription or the mRNA level. Further studies showed that p53 stabilization by Chel A was mediated via induction of phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 protein at Ser345. This notion was substantiated by the results that transfection of dominant negative mutant of Chk1 (GFP-Chk1 D130A) significantly attenuated the p53 protein expression, cell apoptosis, and inhibition of cell transformation by Chel A. Finally, increased hydrogen peroxide was found to mediate Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345, p53 protein induction, cell apoptotic induction, and transformation inhibition following Chel A treatment. Taken together, our studies identify Chel A as a chemopreventive agent with the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved.","['Zhang, Jingjie', 'Gao, Guangxun', 'Chen, Liang', 'Deng, Xu', 'Li, Jingxia', 'Yu, Yonghui', 'Zhang, Dongyun', 'Li, Fei', 'Zhang, Min', 'Zhao, Qinshi', 'Huang, Chuanshu']","['Zhang J', 'Gao G', 'Chen L', 'Deng X', 'Li J', 'Yu Y', 'Zhang D', 'Li F', 'Zhang M', 'Zhao Q', 'Huang C']","['Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 57 Old Forge Rd, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130712,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (cheliensisin A)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Epidermis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Epoxy Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/*drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3769189,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/04/04 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0097 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2013 Sep;6(9):949-958. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0097.

The transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 is a master regulator of haematopoiesis and its alteration leads to leukaemia. Spi-1 overexpression inhibits differentiation and promotes resistance to apoptosis in erythroleukaemia. Here, we show that Spi-1 inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through the transcriptional repression of Bim, a proapoptotic factor. BIM interacts with MCL-1 that behaves as a major player in the survival of the preleukaemic cells. The repression of BIM expression reduces the amount of BIM-MCL-1 complexes, thus increasing the fraction of potentially active antiapoptotic MCL-1. We then demonstrate that Spi-1 represses Bim transcription by binding to the Bim promoter and by promoting the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3, a repressive histone mark) on the Bim promoter. The PRC2 repressive complex of Polycomb is directly responsible for the deposit of H3K27me3 mark at the Bim promoter. SUZ12 and the histone methyltransferase EZH2, two PRC2 subunits bind to the Bim promoter at the same location than H3K27me3, distinct of the Spi-1 DNA binding site. As Spi-1 interacts with SUZ12 and EZH2, these results indicate that Spi-1 modulates the activity of PRC2 without directly recruiting the complex to the site of its activity on the chromatin. Our results identify a new mechanism whereby Spi-1 represses transcription and provide mechanistic insights on the antiapoptotic function of a transcription factor mediated by the epigenetic control of gene expression.","['Ridinger-Saison, M', 'Evanno, E', 'Gallais, I', 'Rimmele, P', 'Selimoglu-Buet, D', 'Sapharikas, E', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F', 'Guillouf, C']","['Ridinger-Saison M', 'Evanno E', 'Gallais I', 'Rimmele P', 'Selimoglu-Buet D', 'Sapharikas E', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Guillouf C']","['Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130712,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Spic protein, mouse)', '0 (Suz12 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",PMC3741512,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201388 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Sep;20(9):1268-78. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.88.

Here we show that Bach2-mediated activation of p53 is required for stringent elimination of pre-B cells that failed to productively rearrange immunoglobulin VH-DJH gene segments. After productive VH-DJH gene rearrangement, pre-B cell receptor signaling ends BACH2-mediated negative selection through B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)-mediated repression of p53. In patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the BACH2-mediated checkpoint control is compromised by deletions, rare somatic mutations and loss of its upstream activator, PAX5. Low levels of BACH2 expression in these patients represent a strong independent predictor of poor clinical outcome. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2(+/+) pre-B cells resist leukemic transformation by Myc through Bach2-dependent upregulation of p53 and do not initiate fatal leukemia in transplant-recipient mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and gene expression analyses carried out by us revealed that BACH2 competes with BCL6 for promoter binding and reverses BCL6-mediated repression of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint-control genes.

However, modest virion production and limited spread between noncontiguous circulating leukemic cells requires high-dose administration of RVs, which exceeds the maximum tolerable dose of the live virus. Furthermore, in severely immunosuppressed leukemic patients, the potential for uncontrolled live virus spread may compromise the safety of a live virus approach. We hypothesized that the barriers to oncolytic virotherapy in liquid tumors may be overcome by administration of high-dose non-replicating RVs.

This novel biopharmaceutical is multimodal possessing direct cytolytic and immunomodulatory activity against acute leukemia. We demonstrate that NRRP resistance in normal cells is mediated by intact antiviral defences including interferon (IFN). This data was substantiated using murine models of blast crisis. The translational promise of NRRPs was demonstrated in clinical samples obtained from patients with high-burden multidrug-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. This is the first successful attempt to eradicate disseminated cancer using a non-replicating virus-derived agent, representing a paradigm shift in our understanding of oncolytic virus-based therapies and their application toward the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Batenchuk, C', 'Le Boeuf, F', 'Stubbert, L', 'Falls, T', 'Atkins, H L', 'Bell, J C', 'Conrad, D P']","['Batenchuk C', 'Le Boeuf F', 'Stubbert L', 'Falls T', 'Atkins HL', 'Bell JC', 'Conrad DP']","['1] Center for Cancer Therapeutics, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada [2] Department of Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada [3] Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130712,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,PMC3730201,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2013/07/16 06:01,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201323 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.23 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Jul 12;3:e123. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.23.,,['Blood Cancer J. 2014 Apr 11;4:e201.

In order to investigate this possibility, male Wistar rats of 22 months of age were divided into three groups. One group remained untreated and acted as the control group. The second was treated with growth hormone (hGH) for 10 weeks (2 mg/kg/d sc) and the third was subjected to melatonin treatment (1 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water for the same time. A group of 2-months-old male rats was used as young controls. All rats were killed by decapitation at more than 24 month of age and dentate gyri of the hippocampi were collected. Aging in the dentate gyrus was associated with an increase in apoptosis promoting markers (Bax, Bad and AIF) and with the reduction of some anti-apoptotic ones (XIAP, NIAP, Mcl-1). Expressions of sirtuin 1 and 2 (SIRT1 and 2) as well as levels of HSP 70 were decreased in the dentate gyrus of old rats. GH treatment was able to reduce the pro/anti-apoptotic ratio to levels observed in young animals and also to increase SIRT2. Melatonin reduced also expression of pro-apoptotic genes and proteins (Bax, Bad and AIF), and increased levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 proteins and SIRT1. Both treatments were able to reduce apoptosis and to enhance survival markers in this part of the hippocampus.","['Kireev, R A', 'Vara, E', 'Tresguerres, J A F']","['Kireev RA', 'Vara E', 'Tresguerres JA']","['Department Physiology, Medical School, University Complutense of Madrid, Spain. rakireev@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130713,Netherlands,Biogerontology,Biogerontology,100930043,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Dentate Gyrus/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Melatonin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3739870,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10522-013-9443-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Biogerontology. 2013 Aug;14(4):431-42. doi: 10.1007/s10522-013-9443-6.

Common fragile sites (CFSs) are specific regions in the human genome that are sensitive to replication stress and are prone to genomic instability in different cancer types. Here we molecularly cloned a new CFS, FRA11H, in 11q13. The genomic region of FRA11H harbors a hotspot of chromosomal breakpoints found in different types of cancer, indicating that this region is unstable during cancer development. We further found that FRA11H is a hotspot for integrations of Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV)-based vectors, following CD34+ infections in vitro as well as ex-vivo during gene therapy trials. Importantly, we found that the MLV-based vector infection in-vitro leads to replication perturbation, DNA damage and increased CFS expression. This suggests that infection by MLV-based vectors leads to replication-induced genome instability, raising further concerns regarding the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy trials.","['Bester, Assaf C', 'Kafri, Moshe', 'Maoz, Karin', 'Kerem, Batsheva']","['Bester AC', 'Kafri M', 'Maoz K', 'Kerem B']","['Department of Genetics, The Life Sciences Institute, Edmond J.

We investigated the precise mechanisms underlying the apoptosis induction by FTY720, especially focusing on the roles of BH3-only proteins, and the therapeutic potency of FTY720 for CML. Enforced expression of either BCL2 or the dominant-negative protein of FADD (FADD.DN) partly protected CML cells from apoptosis by FTY720, indicating the involvement of both cell extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. FTY720 activates pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins: BIM, which is essential for apoptosis by BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and BID, which accelerates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Gene knockdown of either BIM or BID partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720, but the extent of cell protection was not as much as that by overexpression of either BCL2 or FADD.DN. Moreover, knockdown of both BIM and BID did not provide additional protection compared with knockdown of only BIM or BID, indicating that BIM and BID complement each other in apoptosis by FTY720, especially when either is functionally impaired. FTY720 can overcome TKI resistance caused by ABL kinase domain mutations, dysfunction of BIM resulting from gene deletion polymorphism, and galectin-3 overexpression. In addition, ABT-263, a BH3-mimetic, significantly augmented cell death induction by FTY720 both in TKI-sensitive and -resistant leukemic cells. These results provide the rationale that FTY720, with its unique effects on BIM and BID, could lead to new therapeutic strategies for CML.","['Kiyota, Miki', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Yamamoto-Sugitani, Mio', 'Shimura, Yuji', 'Nakayama, Ryuko', 'Nagoshi, Hisao', 'Mizutani, Shinsuke', 'Chinen, Yoshiaki', 'Sasaki, Nana', 'Sakamoto, Natsumi', 'Kobayashi, Tsutomu', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Kiyota M', 'Kuroda J', 'Yamamoto-Sugitani M', 'Shimura Y', 'Nakayama R', 'Nagoshi H', 'Mizutani S', 'Chinen Y', 'Sasaki N', 'Sakamoto N', 'Kobayashi T', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Horiike S', 'Taniwaki M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. junkuro@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10495-013-0882-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-013-0882-y [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Nov;18(11):1437-1446. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0882-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address the role of gammadeltaTCR specificity in their generation, we analyzed their development in mice transgenic (Tg) for a Vgamma1-Jgamma4 chain frequently expressed by NKTgammadelta cells (Tg-gamma) and in mice Tg for the same Vgamma1-Jgamma4 chain together with a Vdelta6BDdelta2Jdelta1 chain not usually found among NKTgammadelta cells (Tg-gammadelta). Surprisingly, both promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)(+) and NK1.1(+) NKTgammadelta cells were found in the thymus of Tg-gammadelta albeit at lower numbers than in Tg-gamma mice, and virtually all of them expressed the Tg TCR. However, the PLZF(+) subset, but not the NK1.1(+) subset, also expressed an endogenous Vdelta6.3/6.4 chain, and its size was severely reduced in TCRdelta(-/-) Tg-gammadelta mice. These results could suggest that the PLZF(+) and the NK1.1(+) subsets are developmentally unrelated. However, PLZF(+) and NK1.1(+) NKTgammadelta cells express identical Vdelta6.3/6.4 chains, and NK1.1(+) cells can be obtained upon intrathymic injection of sorted PLZF(+) cells, thus indicating their developmental relationship. In fact, the NK1.1(+) gammadelta thymocytes present in Tg-gammadelta mice correspond to a small subset of NK1.1(+) gammadelta thymocytes in wild-type animals, which express a more diverse repertoire of TCRs and can be recognized by the expression of the CD62L Ag. Collectively, our data demonstrated that TCR specificity is essential for the development of most NKTgammadelta T cells and revealed a developmental heterogeneity in gammadelta T cells expressing the NK1.1 marker.","['Pereira, Pablo', 'Berthault, Claire', 'Burlen-Defranoux, Odile', 'Boucontet, Laurent']","['Pereira P', 'Berthault C', 'Burlen-Defranoux O', 'Boucontet L']","['Institut Pasteur, Unite Lymphopoiese, INSERM U668, Paris 75724, France. ppereira@pasteur.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Klrb1c protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/analysis', 'L-Selectin/analysis', 'Lymphopoiesis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B/analysis', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1203168 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1203168 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Aug 15;191(4):1716-23. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1203168.

These needs underlie continuing interest in methods to detect and quantify the relevant leukemic cells in clinical samples with improved reliability and specificity. We report the results of comparing three methods to enumerate primitive CP-CML cells in the same samples: genotyping CD34(+)38(-) cells directly by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and measuring BCR-ABL1 transcript-genotyped colony-forming cell outputs in either 5-week long-term cultures (LTCs) containing non-engineered mouse fibroblasts or in 6-week LTCs containing mouse fibroblasts engineered to produce human Steel factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IL-3. The results demonstrate that the first two methods significantly overestimate the prevalence of primitive CP-CML cells by comparison to the third. In additional studies, we found that CML-CD34(+) cells can repopulate the marrow and spleen of serially transplanted adult NOD/SCID-IL-2Rgamma chain-null mice for more than 1 year with an almost exclusive myeloid differentiation in primary and secondary recipients and without evidence of disease progression.

Although autophagy was considered to be a non-selective bulk protein degradation system to recycle amino acids during periods of nutrient starvation, it is also believed to be an essential mechanism for the selective elimination of proteins/organelles that are damaged under pathological conditions. Research advances made using autophagy-deficient animals have revealed that impairments of autophagy often underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary disorders such as Danon, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On the other hand, there are many reports that drugs and toxicants, including arsenic, cadmium, paraquat, methamphetamine, and ethanol, induce autophagy during the development of their toxicity on many organs including heart, brain, lung, kidney, and liver. Although the question as to whether autophagic machinery is involved in the execution of cell death or not remains controversial, the current view of the role of autophagy during cell/tissue injury is that it is an important, often essential, cytoprotective reaction; disturbances in cytoprotective autophagy aggravate cell/tissue injuries. The purpose of this review is to provide (1) a gross summarization of autophagy processes, which are becoming more important in the field of toxicology, and (2) examples of important studies reporting the involvement of perturbations in autophagy in cell/tissue injuries caused by acute as well as chronic intoxication.","['Aki, Toshihiko', 'Funakoshi, Takeshi', 'Unuma, Kana', 'Uemura, Koichi']","['Aki T', 'Funakoshi T', 'Unuma K', 'Uemura K']","['Section of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan. aki.legm@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130710,Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn', 'Humans']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AMP-activated protein kinase', 'AMPK', 'Autophagy', 'BCL2/adenovirus E1B nineteen kDa protein-interacting protein 3', 'BNIP3', 'CYP2E1', 'Drug', 'FIP200', 'FK506-binding protein 12', 'FKBP12', 'Hereditary disorder', 'Keap1', 'Kelch-like ECH associated protein1', 'LAMP', 'LC3', 'LKB1', 'MPT', 'NBR1', 'NIP3-like protein X', 'NPC', 'Niemann-Pick type C', 'Nix', 'Nrf2', 'PI', 'PINK1', 'PML/RARA', 'PTEN-inducible putative kinase protein1', 'ROS', 'SOD', 'TFEB', 'Toxicology', 'ULK1/2', 'cytochrome P450 2E1', 'focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein of 200kDa', 'liver kinase B1', 'lysosome-associated membrane protein', 'mTOR', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'microtuble-associated protein 1 light chain 3', 'mitochondrial permeability transition', 'neighbor of Brca1 gene', 'nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'p62/SQSTM1', 'p62/sequestosome1', 'phosphatidylinositol', 'promyelocytic leukemia protein/retinoic acid receptor alpha', 'reactive oxygen species', 'superoxide anion dismutase', 'transcription factor EB', 'unc-51-like kinase1/2']",2013/07/16 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-483X(13)00170-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2013.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2013 Sep 15;311(3):205-15. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2013.07.001.

Autocrine hGH promotes mammary carcinoma cell survival, proliferation, immortalization; it confers an invasive phenotype as a result of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contributes to chemoresistance and radioresistance. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is being successfully used as a first and second line therapy for the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. It also inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in a broad range of solid tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hGH on sensitivity of a mammary adenocarcinoma cell to ATO, using a stable hGH-transfectant MCF-7 cell line, MCF7-hGH. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the overexpression of hGH increased sensitivity of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to ATO through apoptotic and anti-proliferative mechanisms. The effect of ATO on the transcriptional level of genes involved in survival (Bcl-2, Bax and Survivin), self-sufficiency in growth signals (c-Myc, ARF, Cdc25A, p53 and Bax), immortalization (hTERT) and invasion and metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9, uPA and uPAR and E-cadherin) was more pronounced in MCF7-hGH compared with its parental MCF-7 line.

Because of the importance of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we investigated the activity of the NVP-BKM120, an orally available pan class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor. Sensitivity to NVP-BKM120 was analyzed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia primary samples in the context of B-cell receptor and microenvironment stimulation. NVP-BKM120 promoted mitochondrial apoptosis in most primary cells independently of common prognostic markers. NVP-BKM120 activity induced the blockage of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling, decreased Akt and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to concomitant Mcl-1 downregulation and Bim induction. Accordingly, selective knockdown of BIM rescued cells from NVP-BKM120-induced apoptosis, while the kinase inhibitor synergistically enhanced the apoptosis induced by the BH3-mimetic ABT-263. We also found NVP-BKM120 to inhibit B-cell receptor- and stroma-dependent Akt pathway activation, thus sensitizing chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to bendamustine and fludarabine. Furthermore, NVP-BKM120 down-regulated secretion of chemokines after B-cell receptor stimulation and inhibited cell chemotaxis and actin polymerization upon CXCR4 triggering by CXCL12. Our findings establish that NVP-BKM120 effectively inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling pathway and disturbs the protective effect of the tumor microenvironment with the subsequent apoptosis induction through the Akt/FoxO3a/Bim axis. We provide here a strong rationale for undertaking clinical trials of NVP-BKM120 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients alone or in combination therapies.","['Rosich, Laia', 'Saborit-Villarroya, Ifigenia', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Xargay-Torrent, Silvia', 'Montraveta, Arnau', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Campo, Elias', 'Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Roue, Gael', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Rosich L', 'Saborit-Villarroya I', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Xargay-Torrent S', 'Montraveta A', 'Aymerich M', 'Villamor N', 'Campo E', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Roue G', 'Colomer D']",['dcolomer@clinic.ub.es.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NVP-BKM120)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminopyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC3815175,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.088849 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.088849 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Nov;98(11):1739-47. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.088849.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of complement-dependent cytotoxicity is strongly restricted due to the expression and acquisition of regulators of complement activation by lymphocytic leukemia cells. Whereas the role of membrane regulators of complement activation, such as CD55 and CD59, has been investigated in detail in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the involvement of soluble regulators of complement activation, such as complement factor H, has not yet been reported. Propidium iodide staining was performed to investigate the efficacy of ofatumumab and factor H-derived short-consensus-repeat 18-20 in the induction of complement-dependent cytotoxicity on primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from 20 patients. Deposition of complement C3 fragments was monitored by western blot analysis. Expression of CD20, CD55 or CD59 was determined by FACS analysis. Replacement of factor H with short consensus repeat 18-20 significantly increased the susceptibility of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to ofatumumab-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity. More importantly, addition of short-consensus-repeat 18-20 was able to overcome complement- resistance occurring during treatment with ofatumumab alone. Use of short consensus repeat 18-20 is likely to prolong the turnover time of active C3b fragments generated on the target cells following ofatumumab-induced complement activation, thereby improving specific killing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The relative contribution of factor H to the protection of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells against complement-dependent cytotoxicity was comparable to that of CD55. Our data suggest that, by abrogating factor H function, short consensus repeat 18-20 may provide a novel approach that improves the complement-dependent efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.","['Horl, Susanne', 'Banki, Zoltan', 'Huber, Georg', 'Ejaz, Asim', 'Mullauer, Brigitte', 'Willenbacher, Ella', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Stoiber, Heribert']","['Horl S', 'Banki Z', 'Huber G', 'Ejaz A', 'Mullauer B', 'Willenbacher E', 'Steurer M', 'Stoiber H']",['virologie@i-med.ac.at.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '80295-65-4 (Complement Factor H)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement Factor H/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Consensus Sequence/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology']",PMC3856969,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.089615 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.089615 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Dec;98(12):1939-47. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.089615.

The exposure of dinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA), as a model antigen that stimulates mast cells, induced a robust and long-lasting electrochemical impedance signal in a dose-dependent manner which efficiently measured degranulation of anti-DNP IgE-stimulated mast cells. Then this mast cell-based biosensor was applied into quantification for the shrimp allergen with anti-shrimp tropomyosin IgE-sensitization.

We have isolated four known distinct metabolites designated as alpha-Hydroxyerysotrine, 4'-Methoxy licoflavanone (MLF), Alpinumisoflavone (AIF) and Wighteone. Among the four isolated metabolites the two flavonoids, MLF and AIF were found to be the most potent cytotoxic agent with IC50 of approximately 20muM in human leukemia HL-60 cells. We are reporting first time the anticancer and apoptotic potential of MLF and AIF in HL-60 cells. Both MLF and AIF inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation and induce apoptosis as measured by several biological endpoints. MLF and AIF induce apoptosis bodies formation, enhanced annexinV-FITC binding of the cells, increased sub-G0 cell fraction, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), release of cytochrome c, Bax, activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP (poly ADP Ribose polymers) cleavage in HL-60 cells. MLF and AIF also increase the expression of apical death receptor, Fas, with inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein Bid. All the above parameters revealed that these two flavonoids induce apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in HL-60 cells. In spite of apoptosis, these two flavonoids significantly inhibit nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB and STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) signaling pathway, which are highly expressed in leukemia. The present study provide an insight of molecular mechanism of cell death induced by MLF and AIF in HL-60 cells which may be useful in managing and treating leukemia.","['Kumar, Sunil', 'Pathania, Anup Singh', 'Saxena, A K', 'Vishwakarma, R A', 'Ali, Asif', 'Bhushan, Shashi']","['Kumar S', 'Pathania AS', 'Saxena AK', 'Vishwakarma RA', 'Ali A', 'Bhushan S']","['Division of Natural Product Chemistry, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, CSIR, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130709,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"[""0 (4'-methoxy licoflavanone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '6Q33HOF94Z (alpinumisoflavone)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Erythrina/chemistry', 'Flavonoids/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Isoflavones/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Necrosis', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide', ""4'-Methoxy licoflavanone"", 'AIF', 'Alpinumisoflavone', 'Apoptosis', 'Erythrina suberosa', 'Flavonoids', 'IKK', 'IkappaB kinase', 'MLF', 'MTT', 'NF-kappaB', 'PI', 'PS', 'PTP', 'Rh-123', 'Rhodamine-123', 'STAT', 'Ser', 'Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription', 'Tyr', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'mitochondrial permeability transition pore', 'nuclear transcription factor-kappaB', 'phosphatidyl serine', 'propidium iodide', 'serine', 'tyrosine', 'Deltapsi(m)']",2013/07/16 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(13)00160-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2013.06.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2013 Sep 25;205(2):128-37. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2013.06.020.

The C-terminal domain of Ell3 shows strong similarities to that of Ell (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia gene), which acts as a negative regulator of p53 and regulates cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies in our laboratory showed that Ell3 induces the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells by protecting differentiating cells from apoptosis via the promotion of p53 degradation. In this study, we evaluated the function of Ell3 in breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7 cell lines overexpressing Ell3 were used to examine cell proliferation and cancer stem cell properties. Ectopic expression of Ell3 in breast cancer cell lines induces proliferation and 5-FU resistance. In addition, Ell3 expression increases the cancer stem cell population, which is characterized by CD44 (+) or ALDH1 (+) cells. Mammosphere-forming potential and migration ability were also increased upon Ell3 expression in breast cancer cell lines. Through biochemical and molecular biological analyses, we showed that Ell3 regulates proliferation, cancer stem cell properties and drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines partly through the MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. Murine xenograft experiments showed that Ell3 expression promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. These results suggest that Ell3 may play a critical role in promoting oncogenesis in breast cancer by regulating cell proliferation and cancer stem cell properties via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.","['Ahn, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Gwangil', 'Park, Kyung-Soon']","['Ahn HJ', 'Kim G', 'Park KS']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Life Science, CHA University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ELL3 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-FU', 'Breast cancer', 'Cancer stem cells', 'ERK1/2', 'Ell3', 'Proliferation']",2013/07/16 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)01124-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Aug 9;437(4):557-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.114.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we show that male 2i ESCs are globally hypomethylated compared to conventional ESCs maintained in serum. In serum, female ESCs are hypomethyated similarly to male ESCs in 2i, and DNA methylation is further reduced in 2i. Regions with elevated DNA methylation in 2i strongly correlate with the presence of H3K9me3 on endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and imprinted loci. The methylome of male ESCs in serum parallels postimplantation blastocyst cells, while 2i stalls ESCs in a hypomethylated, ICM-like state. WGBS analysis during adaptation of 2i ESCs to serum suggests that deposition of DNA methylation is largely random, while loss of DNA methylation during reversion to 2i occurs passively, initiating at TET1 binding sites. Together, our analysis provides insight into DNA methylation dynamics in cultured ESCs paralleling early developmental processes.","['Habibi, Ehsan', 'Brinkman, Arie B', 'Arand, Julia', 'Kroeze, Leonie I', 'Kerstens, Hindrik H D', 'Matarese, Filomena', 'Lepikhov, Konstantin', 'Gut, Marta', 'Brun-Heath, Isabelle', 'Hubner, Nina C', 'Benedetti, Rosaria', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Walter, Jorn', 'Gut, Ivo G', 'Marks, Hendrik', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G']","['Habibi E', 'Brinkman AB', 'Arand J', 'Kroeze LI', 'Kerstens HH', 'Matarese F', 'Lepikhov K', 'Gut M', 'Brun-Heath I', 'Hubner NC', 'Benedetti R', 'Altucci L', 'Jansen JH', 'Walter J', 'Gut IG', 'Marks H', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences NCMLS, Radboud University, 6525GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130711,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sulfites)', '0 (TET1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Genome/genetics', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sulfites/chemistry']",,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(13)00260-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2013 Sep 5;13(3):360-9. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.002.

We show that leukemic myeloid cells stimulate MSCs to overproduce functionally altered OBCs, which accumulate in the BM cavity as inflammatory myelofibrotic cells. We identify roles for thrombopoietin, CCL3, and direct cell-cell interactions in driving OBC expansion, and for changes in TGF-beta, Notch, and inflammatory signaling in OBC remodeling. MPN-expanded OBCs, in turn, exhibit decreased expression of many HSC retention factors and severely compromised ability to maintain normal HSCs, but effectively support LSCs.

As controls, non-leukemic pediatric patients were studied. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out by G- banding and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differential expression of certain proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The obtained data revealed that CLUS, CERU, APOE, APOA4, APOA1, GELS, S10A9, AMBP, ACTB, CATA and AFAM proteins play a significant role in leukemia prognosis, potentially serving as distinctive biomarkers for leukemia aggressiveness, or as suppressor proteins in HR-ALL cases.

FINDINGS: Using a novel approach based on the combination of fine-tiling comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) and ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), we molecularly identified a malignant gammadelta + T cell clone with a Vdelta5Ddelta2Jdelta1 rearrangement that was paired with a T cell receptor (TCR) VgammaI and comprised a Vgamma1Vdelta5 T cell clone in a relapse T-ALL patient. This malignant Vdelta5 T cell clone disappeared after chemotherapy, but the clone was detected again when disease relapsed post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at 100 weeks. Using PCR and GeneScan analyses, the distribution and clonality of the TCR Vgamma and Vdelta subfamilies were examined before and after allo-HSCT in the patient. A reactive T cell clone with a Vdelta4Ddelta3Jdelta1 rearrangement was identified in all samples taken at different time points (i.e., 4, 8, 68, 100 and 108 weeks after allo-HSCT). The expression of this Vdelta4+ T cell clone was higher in the patient during complete remission (CR) post allo-HSCT and at disease relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a sensitive methodology to detect T cell subclones, which may be used to monitor minimal residual disease and immune reconstitution.","['Chen, Shaohua', 'Huang, Xin', 'Zheng, Haitao', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Du, Xin', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Chen S', 'Huang X', 'Zheng H', 'Geng S', 'Wu X', 'Yang L', 'Weng J', 'Du X', 'Li Y']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Clone Cells', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*immunology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3717050,,,2013/07/16 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-73 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-73 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Jul 12;12:73. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Causal mutations have been identified in the gene encoding runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) of FPD patients. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of RUNX1 in the regulation of expression of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and to propose a plausible mechanism underlying RUNX1-mediated induction of the FPD phenotype. METHODS: We assessed whether RUNX1 and its mutants, in combination with E26 transformation-specific-1 (ETS-1), Core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFbeta), and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1), cooperatively regulate PF4 expression during megakaryocytic differentiation. In an embryonic stem cell differentiation system, expression levels of endogenous and exogenous RUNX1 and PF4 were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Promoter activation by the transcription factors were evaluated by reporter gene assays with HepG2 cells. DNA binding activity and protein interaction were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation assay with Cos-7 cells, respectively. Protein localization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting with Cos-7 cells. RESULTS: We demonstrated that RUNX1 activates endogenous PF4 expression in megakaryocytic differentiation. RUNX1, but not its mutants, in combination with ETS-1 and CBFbeta, or FLI-1, synergistically activated the PF4 promoter. Each RUNX1 mutant harbors various functional abnormalities, including loss of DNA-binding activity, abnormal subcellular localization, and/or alterations of binding affinities for ETS-1, CBFbeta, and FLI-1. CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1, but not its mutants, strongly and synergistically activates PF4 expression along with ETS family proteins. Furthermore, loss of the RUNX1 transcriptional activation function is induced by various functional abnormalities.","['Okada, Y', 'Watanabe, M', 'Nakai, T', 'Kamikawa, Y', 'Shimizu, M', 'Fukuhara, Y', 'Yonekura, M', 'Matsuura, E', 'Hoshika, Y', 'Nagai, R', 'Aird, W C', 'Doi, T']","['Okada Y', 'Watanabe M', 'Nakai T', 'Kamikawa Y', 'Shimizu M', 'Fukuhara Y', 'Yonekura M', 'Matsuura E', 'Hoshika Y', 'Nagai R', 'Aird WC', 'Doi T']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Platelet Factor 4/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ETS1 protein, human', 'FLI1 protein, human', 'RUNX1 protein, human', 'megakaryocytes', 'platelet disorder, familial, with associated myeloid malignancy', 'platelet factor 4']",2013/07/16 06:00,2014/04/24 06:00,['2013/07/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jth.12355 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2013 Sep;11(9):1742-50. doi: 10.1111/jth.12355.,,,['(c) 2013 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],,,,,,,,,,

Many of the high-risk cases of childhood leukemia with the poorest prognosis have been found to harbor specific genetic signatures, often resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. With increased understanding of the genetic and epigenetic makeup of high-risk pediatric leukemia has come the opportunity to develop targeted therapies that promise to be both more effective and less toxic than current chemotherapy. Of particular importance is an understanding of the interconnections between different targets within the same cancer, and observations of synergy between two different targeted therapies or between a targeted drug and conventional chemotherapy. It has become clear that many cancers are able to circumvent a single specific blockade, and pediatric leukemias are no exception in this regard. This review highlights the most promising approaches to new drugs and drug combinations for high-risk pediatric leukemia.

IDH1/2 mutations prevent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and modulate the function of IDH (neomorphic activity) thereby facilitating reduction of alpha-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), a putative oncometabolite. D-2HG is thought to act as a competitive inhibitor of alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases that include prolyl hydroxylases and chromatin-modifying enzymes. The end result is a global increase of cellular DNA hypermethylation and alterations of the cellular epigenetic state, which has been proposed to play a role in the development of a variety of tumors.

Recently, its pharmacological role in the prevention and treatment of cancer has received increasing attention. However, the mechanisms by which garlic extract (GE) induces cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in cancer cells remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to use HL-60 cells as a test model to evaluate whether or not GE-induced cytotoxicty and apoptosis in human leukemia (HL-60) cells is mediated through oxidative stress. METHODS: Human leukemia (HL-60) cells were treated with different concentrations of GE for 12 hr. Cell survival was determined by MTT assay. The extent of oxidative cell/tissue damage was determined by measuring malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation biomarker) concentrations by spectrophotometry. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry assessment (Annexin-V and caspase-3 assays) and agarose gel electrophoresis (DNA laddering assay). RESULTS: Data obtained from the MTT assay indicated that GE significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the viability of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We detected a significant (p < 0.05) increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in GE-treated HL-60 cells compared to the control. Flow cytometry data showed a strong concentration-response relationship between GE exposure and Annexin-V positive HL-60 cells. Similarly, a statistically significant and concentration-dependent increase (p <0.05) were recorded with regard to caspase-3 activity in HL-60 cells undergoing late apoptosis. These results were confirmed by data of DNA laddering assay showing a clear evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in GE-treated cells. CONCLUSION: Our finding indicates that GE-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells involve phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation associated with the formation of MDA, a by-product of lipid peroxidation and biomarker of oxidative stress. At therapeutic concentrations, GE-induced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in HL-60 cells is mediated by oxidative stress.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, P.O.

Our data showed that the membrane capacitance of NB4 cells decreases from 9.42 to 7.63 mF/m(2) in the first 2 hours following treatment with Ara-C, and that this decreased capacitance persists for >12 hours. Additionally, cytoplasmic conductivity decreases from 0.217 to 0.190 S/m within 2 hours of Ara-C treatment; this level is maintained for a short period of time before decreasing. We also investigated these events molecularly at the level of gene expression using microarray analysis and showed that the expression of genes related to membrane capacitance and cytoplasmic conductivity change dramatically as early as 2 hours post-Ara-C treatment, and further demonstrated a temporal relationship between the dielectric properties and key events in apoptosis.

Although CML is very responsive to the selective TKIs, with response rates in chronic phase of greater than 90%, unusual presentations have been documented. Response rates for patients with CML in accelerated phase and blast crisis are notably lower to both first- and second-generation TKIs. This report presents a recent case of a young woman with newly diagnosed CML who presented with an accelerated phase isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse after standard imatinib therapy, who initially experienced a complete hematologic response. Further treatment options, and monitoring of disease response, are discussed. Aggressive strategies, such as intrathecal chemotherapy, change in tyrosine kinase inhibitor to one with increased CNS penetration, and consideration of allogenic stem cell transplantation, are potential therapeutic modalities.

Three-year estimates of overall survival were 73% (64%-79%) and 32% (17%-48%) for MRDneg and MRDpos CR1 patients, respectively, and 73% (57%-83%) and 44% (21%-65%) for MRDneg and MRDpos CR2 patients, respectively.

Among the MRDpos patients, there was no statistically significant evidence that increasing levels of MRD were associated with increasing risks of relapse and death. After multivariable adjustment, risks of death and relapse were 2.61 times and 4.90 times higher for MRD(pos) patients (P < .001).

Although the mechanism of action of LysoTracker dyes is not fully understood, they have been used in microscopy to image acidic spherical organelles, and their use in flow cytometry has not been thoroughly investigated in the study of autophagy. This investigation uses numerous autophagy-inducing agents including chloroquine (CQ), rapamycin, low serum (<1%) RPMI, and nutrient starvation to induce autophagy in Jurkat T-cell leukemia and K562 erythromyeloid cell lines. LC3B showed an increase with CQ treatment although this was different to LysoTracker signals in terms of dose and time. Rapamycin, low serum (<1%) RPMI, and nutrient starvation induction of autophagy also induced an increase in LysoTracker and LC3B signals. CQ also induced apoptosis in cell lines, which was blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD resulting in a reduction in cells undergoing apoptosis and a subsequent upregulation of autophagic markers LC3B and lysosomal dye signals. Given that LC3B and LysoTracker are measuring different biological events in the autophagic process, they surprisingly both upregulated during autophagic process. This study, however, shows that although LysoTracker dyes do not specifically label lysosomes or autophagosomes within the cell, they allow the simultaneous measurement of an autophagy-related process and other live-cell functions, which are not possible with the standard LC3B antibody-labeling technique. This method has the advantage of other live-cell LCB-GFP-tagged experiments in that be used to analyze patient cells as well as easier to use and significantly less costly.","['Chikte, Shaheen', 'Panchal, Neelam', 'Warnes, Gary']","['Chikte S', 'Panchal N', 'Warnes G']","['Flow Cytometry Core Facility, The Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London University, London, E1 2AT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130711,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Natural compound curcumin could potentially sensitize resistant cancer cells to TRAIL. We found that the combination of TRAIL with curcumin can synergistically induces apoptosis in three TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell lines. The mechanism behind this synergistic cell death was investigated by examining an effect of curcumin on the expression and activation of TRAIL-associated cell death proteins. Immunoblotting, RNA interference, and use of chemical inhibitors of TRAIL-activate signaling revealed differential effects of curcumin on the expression of Mcl-1 and activities of ERK and Akt. Curcumin-induced production of reactive oxygen species did not affect total expression of DR5 but it enhanced mobilization of DR5 to the plasma membrane. In these breast cancer cells curcumin also induced downregulation of IAP proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that a combination of TRAIL and curcumin is a potentially promising treatment for breast cancer, although the specific mechanisms involved in this sensitization could differ even among breast cancer cells of different origins.","['Park, Sojung', 'Cho, Dong Hyung', 'Andera, Ladislav', 'Suh, Nayoung', 'Kim, Inki']","['Park S', 'Cho DH', 'Andera L', 'Suh N', 'Kim I']","['Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 138-736, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130712,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/13 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-013-1752-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2013 Nov;383(1-2):39-48. doi: 10.1007/s11010-013-1752-1.

Previous studies have reported FLT3 mutation in as many as 9.2% of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs), as well as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, that are negative for the JAK2 V617F gene mutation; no FLT3 mutation has been found in JAK2-positive MPNs, suggesting that the mutations are mutually exclusive. The goal of our study is to evaluate the mutational status of the FLT3 gene in patients with an MPN or MDS/MPN, in correlation with the JAK2 mutational status. Patient specimens were retrospectively identified on the basis of MPN or MDS/MPN diagnosis and JAK2 analysis from February 2006 to December 2011. FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on DNA extracted from 152 patients using polymerase chain reaction amplification and analysis of amplicons by gel electrophoresis for internal tandem duplication mutations and by restriction endonuclease digestion fragment analysis for the D835 point mutation. FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on 90 cases of JAK2-negative MPN or MDS/MPN and 62 cases of JAK2-positive MPN. One FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation was identified in the JAK2-negative group (1.1%), and none were identified in the JAK2-positive group, confirming the absence of FLT3 mutations in JAK2-positive specimens. The FLT3-positive MPN patient was diagnosed with MPN, unclassifiable, and was later found to have myeloid sarcoma; thus, FLT3 mutation was not seen in the usual types of MPN in our series. Our result of 1.1% FLT3 mutations in JAK2-negative MPN and MDS/MPN cases is lower than the 9.2% previously reported.","['Williams, Lindsay', 'Kelley, Harlan H', 'Meng, Xiuling', 'Prada, Anne', 'Crisan, Domnita']","['Williams L', 'Kelley HH', 'Meng X', 'Prada A', 'Crisan D']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USA. lindsay.williams@beaumont.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,,2013/07/13 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e31828564fe [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2013 Sep;22(3):156-60. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e31828564fe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of ITD-positive minor clones at the initial diagnosis and during the minimal residual disease stage may be essential. We previously designed a delta-PCR strategy to improve the sensitivity to 0.1% ITD-positive leukemia cells and showed that minor mutants with an allele burden of <1% can be clinically significant. In this study, we report on tandem duplication PCR (TD-PCR), a modified inverse PCR assay, and demonstrate a limit of detection of a few molecules of ITD mutants. The TD-PCR was initially designed to confirm ITD mutation of an amplicon, which was undetectable by capillary electrophoresis and was incidentally isolated by a molecular fraction collecting tool. Subsequently, TD-PCR detected ITD mutation in 2 of 77 patients previously reported as negative for ITD mutation by a standard PCR assay. TD-PCR can also potentially be applied to monitor minimal residual disease with high analytic sensitivity in a portion of ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further studies using TD-PCR to detect ITD mutants at diagnosis may clarify the clinical significance of those ITD mutants with extremely low allele burden.","['Lin, Ming-Tseh', 'Tseng, Li-Hui', 'Beierl, Katie', 'Hsieh, Antony', 'Thiess, Michele', 'Chase, Nadine', 'Stafford, Amanda', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Eshleman, James R', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Lin MT', 'Tseng LH', 'Beierl K', 'Hsieh A', 'Thiess M', 'Chase N', 'Stafford A', 'Levis MJ', 'Eshleman JR', 'Gocke CD']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3744591,,,2013/07/13 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e31828308a1 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2013 Sep;22(3):149-55. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e31828308a1.,"['R21 HG004315/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HG005745/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HG004315/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HG005745/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS435912'],,,,,,,,

This study consisted of two parts. Tolerability was assessed in phase I (Part A), while the overall response rate (ORR) was assessed in phase II (comprising Parts A and B). Three patients were enrolled in Part A, and another seven patients were enrolled in Part B. Ofatumumab 300 mg was given at the first infusion, followed by seven weekly and four monthly infusions of 2000 mg. No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity, and tolerability was confirmed. The ORR was 70 %. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. No patients discontinued the study due to AEs.

I/R injury is associated with transient tissue oxygen deprivation due to vessel occlusion and a subsequent reperfusion period following restoration of blood flow. Initial tissue damage inflicted by ischemia is aggravated in the reperfusion period through mechanisms such as burst of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and inflammatory reactions. I/R injury occurs during surgical interventions, organ transplantation, diseases such as myocardial infarction, circulatory shock, and toxic insults. Recently, microRNAs have come into focus as powerful regulators of gene expression and potential diagnostic tools during I/R injury. These small noncoding ribonucleotides (~22 nucleotides in length) posttranscriptionally target mRNAs, culminating in suppression of protein synthesis or increase in mRNA degradation, thus fundamentally influencing organ function.

DNA damage in a healthy cell activates the FA pathway where 15 individual FA proteins interact and function together to maintain genomic stability. The disruption of this pathway results in the characteristic cellular phenotype and clinical outcome of the disease. The diverse clinical symptoms of FA such as impaired immunity and predisposition to cancers may not be explained exclusively by a non-functional FA pathway. These symptoms could then be attributed to defects in other functions of the individual FA proteins. To identify the effects of a mutant FA protein, FANCC, a transcriptome analysis was carried out on a FANCC mutant cell line (EUFA 450) and its revertant isogenic control cell line (EUFA 450Rev). Microarray data revealed dysregulation of genes involved in regulation of cell death and immune response. This study reports for the first time, the lowered expression of a tumor suppressor gene - caveolin-1, in FANCC mutant cells. The downregulation of caveolin-1 can be significant as Fanconi anemia patients have an elevated predisposition to develop cancer.","['Shyamsunder, Pavithra', 'Vidyasekar, Prasanna', 'Shukla, Akshay Ranjan', 'Mohan, Sheila', 'Verma, Rama Shanker']","['Shyamsunder P', 'Vidyasekar P', 'Shukla AR', 'Mohan S', 'Verma RS']","['Stem cell and Molecular Biology laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600 036, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20130709,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Caveolin 1/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome']",,['NOTNLM'],"[""2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2"", 'CDC2', 'CXCL10', 'CXCR3', 'Cav-1', 'Caveolin-1', 'Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10', 'Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3', 'Cyclin dependent kinase 1', 'EBV', 'Epstein barr virus', 'FA', 'FANCC', 'FAZF', 'Fanconi anemia', 'Fanconi anemia C complementation group', 'Functional enrichment', 'GO', 'Gene Ontology', 'HES1', 'HSP70', 'Hairy enhancer split 1', 'Heat shock protein 70', 'IFN', 'IL1R1', 'Impaired immunity', 'Interferon', 'Interleukin 1 receptor, type I', 'Microarray analysis', 'OAS2', 'PKR', 'Protein kinase R', 'TIR', 'TNF', 'Toll and IL-receptor 1', 'Tumor necrosis factor', 'Tumor suppressor', 'Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 32']",2013/07/13 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(13)00819-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.051 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2013 Sep 25;527(2):521-8. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.06.051.

The development of preventive and therapeutic strategies against sarcopenia is therefore perceived as an urgent need by health professionals and has instigated intensive research on the pathophysiology of this syndrome. The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is multifaceted and encompasses lifestyle habits, systemic factors (e.g., chronic inflammation and hormonal alterations), local environment perturbations (e.g., vascular dysfunction), and intramuscular specific processes. In this scenario, derangements in skeletal myocyte mitochondrial function are recognized as major factors contributing to the age-dependent muscle degeneration. In this review, we summarize prominent findings and controversial issues on the contribution of specific mitochondrial processes - including oxidative stress, quality control mechanisms and apoptotic signaling - on the development of sarcopenia. Extramuscular alterations accompanying the aging process with a potential impact on myocyte mitochondrial function are also discussed. We conclude with presenting methodological and safety considerations for the design of clinical trials targeting mitochondrial dysfunction to treat sarcopenia. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of monitoring the effects of an intervention on muscle mitochondrial function and identifying the optimal target population for the trial.

Importantly, at these concentrations, no cytotoxicity was observed in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results confirmed that GTN inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat and K562 leukemia cells at concentrations as low as 5 muM as shown by reporter gene assays and western blots. Moreover, GTN down-regulated translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer to the nucleus, prevented binding of NF-kappaB to its DNA response element and reduced TNF-alpha-activated interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression. In conclusion, GTN inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation at non-apoptogenic concentrations in different leukemia cell models without presenting toxicity towards healthy blood cells underlining the anti-leukemic potential of this natural compound.","['Orlikova, Barbora', 'Schumacher, Marc', 'Juncker, Tom', 'Yan, Choo Chee', 'Inayat-Hussain, Salmaan H', 'Hajjouli, Sheherazade', 'Cerella, Claudia', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Orlikova B', 'Schumacher M', 'Juncker T', 'Yan CC', 'Inayat-Hussain SH', 'Hajjouli S', 'Cerella C', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Fondation de Recherche Cancer et Sang, Hopital Kirchberg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '34W9GO6B2Z (goniothalamin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Discovery', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Goniothalamus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Malaysia', 'NF-kappa B/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrones/adverse effects/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer drug discovery', 'BSA', 'Cancer', 'EMSA', 'GTN', 'IKKbeta', 'IL-8', 'Inflammation', 'NF-kappaB', 'NF-kappaB inducing kinase', 'NIK', 'PBMC', 'Plant natural product', 'TAB1', 'TAK1', 'TAK1-binding protein 1', 'TNF-alpha', 'TNF-alpha-receptor-1', 'TNFR-1', 'TNFR-1 associated death domain', 'TNFR-associated factor-2', 'TRADD', 'TRAF2', 'bovine serum albumin', 'electrophoretic mobility shift assay', 'goniothalamin', 'inhibitor of kappaB kinase beta', 'interleukine-8', 'nuclear factor kappaB', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'tumor growth factor activated kinase 1', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha']",2013/07/13 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(13)00443-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2013.06.051 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2013 Sep;59:572-8. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2013.06.051.

This identity is maintained during cell replication in a heritable but DNA-independent manner. The preservation of cell identity is fundamental, especially when cells must undergo changes in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals. The maintenance proteins, which are required for cell identity preservation, act epigenetically by regulating gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling. Among the maintenance proteins, the Trithorax (TrxG) and Polycomb (PcG) group proteins are the best characterized. In this review, we summarize the structures and activities of the TrxG and PcG complexes and describe their pivotal roles in nuclear estrogen receptor activity. In addition, we provide evidence that perturbations in these epigenetic regulators are involved in disrupting epithelial cell identity, mammary gland remodeling, and breast cancer initiation.","['Coradini, Danila', 'Oriana, Saro']","['Coradini D', 'Oriana S']","['Department of Clinical and Community Health Sciences, Medical Statistics, Biometry and Bioinformatics, University of Milan 20133, Italy. danila.coradini@yahoo.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130712,England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/growth & development', '*Mammary Glands, Human/cytology/growth & development', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism']",PMC3935006,,,2013/07/13 06:00,2014/11/15 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cjc.013.10040 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.013.10040 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2014 Feb;33(2):51-67. doi: 10.5732/cjc.013.10040.

This reaction requires the multimerization of IN to coordinate a nucleophilic attack of the 3' ends of viral DNA at two staggered phosphodiester bonds on the recipient DNA. Several models indicate that a tetramer of IN would be required for two-end concerted integration. Complementation assays have shown that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of integrase is essential for concerted integration, contributing to the formation of a multimer through protein-protein interaction. The isolated NTD of Mo-MLV integrase behave as a dimer in solution however the structure of the dimer in solution is not known. RESULTS: In this work, crosslinking and mass spectrometry were used to identify regions involved in the dimerization of the isolated Mo-MLV NTD. The distances between the crosslinked lysines within the monomer are in agreement with the structure of the NTD monomer found in 3NNQ. The intermolecular crosslinked peptides corresponding to Lys 20-Lys 31, Lys 24-Lys 24 and Lys 68-Lys 88 were identified. The 3D coordinates of 3NNQ were used to derive a theoretical structure of the NTD dimer with the suite 3D-Dock, based on shape and electrostatics complementarity, and filtered with the distance restraints determined in the crosslinking experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The crosslinking results are consistent with the monomeric structure of NTD in 3NNQ, but for the dimer, in our model both polypeptides are oriented in parallel with each other and the contacting areas between the monomers would involve the interactions between helices 1 and helices 3 and 4.","['Henriquez, Daniel R', 'Zhao, Caifeng', 'Zheng, Haiyan', 'Arbildua, Jose J', 'Acevedo, Monica L', 'Roth, Monica J', 'Leon, Oscar']","['Henriquez DR', 'Zhao C', 'Zheng H', 'Arbildua JJ', 'Acevedo ML', 'Roth MJ', 'Leon O']","['Programa de Virologia ICBM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130711,England,BMC Struct Biol,BMC structural biology,101088689,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dimerization', 'Integrases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Static Electricity', 'Viral Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism']",PMC3750625,,,2013/07/13 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6807-13-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6807-13-14 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Struct Biol. 2013 Jul 11;13:14. doi: 10.1186/1472-6807-13-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical antifungal therapy is considered if the fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin. However, the timing of initiating empirical antifungal therapy can vary from 3 to 8 days of non-response to antibiotics. We choose to determine the response of empirical amphotericin B deoxycholate (dAMB) starting either on day 4 or day 8 in febrile neutropenic patients not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics and without localisation of fever. Fifty-six patients with persistent neutropenic fever despite 72 h of antibiotic therapy were randomly assigned to receive dAMB either starting on day 4 (group A, n = 27, median age 23 years) or starting on day 8 (group B, n = 29, median age 25 years). Satisfactory response (patient remaining afebrile for 48 h and maintaining absolute neutrophil count >500 mul(-1) ) occurred in 85.2% of patients in group A vs. 69.5% in group B (P = 0.209). Patients in group A took significantly fewer days to become afebrile than group B (5.4 +/- 3.9 days vs. 11.3 +/- 4.0 days, P = 0.0001). The adverse side effects of dAMB (nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) occurred at similar rates in both groups. Early addition of empirical dAMB in febrile neutropenic patients leads to their early defervescence and decreased dose requirement.","['Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Makkar, Akash', 'Guru Murthy, Guru Subramanian', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Chakrabarti, Arunaloke']","['Malhotra P', 'Makkar A', 'Guru Murthy GS', 'Varma N', 'Varma S', 'Chakrabarti A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20130711,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antifungal therapy', 'aplastic anaemia', 'empirical therapy', 'haematological disorders', 'infections', 'leukaemia']",2013/07/13 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2013/07/13 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/myc.12108 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2014 Feb;57(2):110-5. doi: 10.1111/myc.12108.

Individuals who carry TPMT allele variants are more likely to experience life-threatening toxicity when these drugs are given at a standard dose. Wildtype phenotype TPMT*1 exhibits high level of catalytic activity, while all variants manifest with a decreased enzymatic activity. Ethnic-related differences in the distribution of TPMT variant alleles have been found. In Mexico, limited information is available; so far only two studies have been published and clear differences exist between them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Allelic variants and genotypes of the TPMT gene were determined in 240 Mexican children with leukemia and solid tumors using DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Polymorphisms G460A and A719G were identified by PCR-RFLP and G238C by the specific-allele PCR assay. The enzyme variants were detected by allelic discrimination. RESULTS: Homozygous wild-type genotype TPMT*1/TPMT*1 was found in 173 patients (72.1%); 67 cases (27.9%) were heterozygous: 18 with genotype TPMT*1/TPMT*3B (7.5%), 17 TPMT*1/TPMT*3C (7.1%), 16 TPMT*1/TMPT*2 (6.7%), 14 TPMT*1/TPMT*3A (5.8%), and 2 (0.8%) were homozygous for two variants: TPMT*2/ TPMT*3B in both.

In general, information on the frequency of thrombotic events, their clinical characteristics and survival in adult patients with acute leukemia is still scarce and controversial. OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of thrombotic events, their clinical characteristics and survival of adult patients with acute leukemia at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion, Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A patient cohort, diagnosed and treated between October 2003 and December 2009, was retrospectively analyzed in terms of thrombotic events, frequencies and survival curves. RESULTS: We analyzed 181 patients with a median age of 33 years, 80 were female (44.2%). Fifteen cases with thrombosis (8.3%) were documented and in 53.3% of cases, they were related to the use of a central venous catheter. The median time to development of thrombosis was 92 days; 33.3% of events occurred during the first 30 days after diagnosis. The incidence of thrombosis in patients receiving L-asparaginase was 15%. Of the 15 patients with thrombosis, 27% were alive and without evidence of disease at last follow-up, and 73% had died; disease progression was the most common cause of death (81.8%). None of the thrombotic events had an impact on mortality. Median overall survival (OS) was 349 days. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of thrombosis in this adult acute leukemia population is comparable to that reported in the literature. Only a third of cases occurred during the first month after diagnosis; however, 93.3% of patients developed a thrombotic event during the first year after the diagnosis of acute leukemia. All cases were symptomatic and central venous catheter-related thrombosis was the most frequent presentation in this group.

Using data from population-based insurance claims, we assessed the risk of developing secondary malignancies after multiple myeloma, in particular hematologic malignancies. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 3970 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma from the registry of catastrophic illnesses between 1997 and 2009. A total of 15880 subjects without multiple myeloma were randomly selected as comparisons from the insured population, frequency-matched based on gender, age, and the date of diagnosis. The incidence of secondary malignancies was ascertained through cross-referencing with the National Cancer Registry System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for analyses. The incidence of multiple myeloma in the insured population increased annually. The overall incidence of secondary malignancy was lower in the multiple myeloma cohort than in the comparison cohort (93.6 vs. 104.5 per 10,000 person-years, IRR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.78-1.04). The incidence of hematologic malignancies was 11-fold greater for multiple myeloma patients (47.2 vs. 4.09 per 10,000 person-years) with an adjusted HR of 13.0 (95% CI = 7.79-21.6) compared with the comparison cohort. The relative risk of secondary malignancy was also strong for myeloid leukemia (21.2 vs. 1.36 per 10,000 person-years). Gender- and age-specific analysis for secondary hematologic malignancies showed that males and patients with multiple myeloma <60 years of age had a higher risk of secondary malignancy than females and patients with multiple myeloma >60 years of age.

These included a group enriched in MBL(lo) clones expressing specific IGHV subgroups (e.g. VH3-23) with no or isolated good-prognosis cytogenetic alterations, a second group which mainly consisted of clinical MBL(hi) and advanced stage CLL with a skewed but different CLL-associated IGHV gene repertoire (e.g. VH1-69), frequently associated with complex karyotypes and poor-prognosis cytogenetic alterations, and a third group of clones with intermediate features, with prevalence of mutated IGHV genes, and higher numbers of del(13q)(+) clonal B-cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that the specific IGHV repertoire and IGHV mutational status of CLL-like B-cell clones may modulate the type of cytogenetic alterations acquired, their rate of acquisition and/or potentially also their clinical consequences. Further long-term follow-up studies investigating the IGHV gene repertoire of MBL(lo) clones in distinct geographic areas and microenvironments are required to confirm our findings and shed light on the potential role of some antigen-binding BCR specificities contributing to clonal evolution.","['Henriques, Ana', 'Rodriguez-Caballero, Arancha', 'Nieto, Wendy G', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Criado, Ignacio', 'Lecrevisse, Quentin', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Pais, Maria L', 'Paiva, Artur', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Henriques A', 'Rodriguez-Caballero A', 'Nieto WG', 'Langerak AW', 'Criado I', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Gonzalez M', 'Pais ML', 'Paiva A', 'Almeida J', 'Orfao A']","['Cancer Research Center, IBMCC, USAL-CSIC, Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service, University of Salamanca and Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Size', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3701012,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067751 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-04321 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 3;8(7):e67751. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067751.

Few interventions have sought to improve functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) during treatment. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of an exercise intervention among older adults with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pilot study of adults >/=50 years of age hospitalized for AML chemotherapy. The four week exercise intervention included stretching, walking, and strength exercises. Feasibility measures included recruitment, retention, number of exercise sessions completed, and barriers to participation. Physical function, HRQL, depression, and distress were assessed at baseline (week 1), upon completion of intervention (week 5), and during follow-up (weeks 9-13). Exploratory analyses used repeated measures ANCOVA to model changes over time. RESULTS: Among 55 eligible inpatients, 24 enrolled (43.6%). Mean age was 65.1 years (SD 7.8). 87.5% of participants completed baseline measures; 70.8% attended >/=1 exercise sessions, and 50.0% completed post-intervention assessment. Among baseline characteristics, only higher physical performance was associated with greater number of exercise sessions attended (p=0.001). Post intervention, HRQL and depressive symptoms improved (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to an exercise intervention was feasible. Exercise shows promise to maintain physical function and enhance HRQL. Strategies to enhance adherence to exercise are needed to maximize benefit.","['Klepin, Heidi D', 'Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Stott, Kylie', 'Daley, Kristin', 'Vishnevsky, Tanya', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Mihalko, Shannon L']","['Klepin HD', 'Danhauer SC', 'Tooze JA', 'Stott K', 'Daley K', 'Vishnevsky T', 'Powell BL', 'Mihalko SL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, NC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Geriatr Oncol,Journal of geriatric oncology,101534770,,,,PMC3703780,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'elderly', 'exercise', 'physical activity', 'physical function', 'quality of life']",2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jgo.2010.10.004 [doi]', 'S1879-4068(10)00059-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Geriatr Oncol. 2011 Jan;2(1):11-17. doi: 10.1016/j.jgo.2010.10.004.,['P30 AG021332/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS468421'],,,,,,,,

These gammaretroviruses rely on the XPR1 receptor for entry, and the unique resistance of laboratory mice is due to two mutations in different putative XPR1 extracellular loops. Cells from avian species differ in susceptibility to X-MLVs, and 2 replacement mutations in the virus-resistant chicken XPR1 (K496Q and Q579E) distinguish it from the more permissive duck and quail receptors. These substitutions align with the two mutations that disable the laboratory mouse XPR1. Mutagenesis of the chicken and duck genes confirms that residues at both sites are critical for virus entry. Among 32 avian species, the 2 disabling XPR1 mutations are found together only in the chicken, an omnivorous, ground-dwelling fowl that was domesticated in India and/or Southeast Asia, which is also where X-MLV-infected house mice evolved. The receptor-disabling mutations are also present separately in 5 additional fowl and raptor species, all of which are native to areas of Asia populated by the virus-infected subspecies Mus musculus castaneus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the avian XPR1 gene is under positive selection at sites implicated in receptor function, suggesting a defensive role for XPR1 in the avian lineage. Contact between bird species and virus-infected mice may thus have favored selection of mouse virus-resistant receptor orthologs in the birds, and our data suggest that similar receptor-disabling mutations were fixed in mammalian and avian species exposed to similar virus challenges.","['Martin, Carrie', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Wollenberg, Kurt', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Martin C', 'Buckler-White A', 'Wollenberg K', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130710,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asia', 'Chickens', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Resistance', 'Ducks', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poultry Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Virus Internalization', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*physiology']",PMC3754004,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01327-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01327-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Sep;87(18):10094-104. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01327-13.

METHODS: We compared immunological aspects and markers for ATLL in HTLV-1 patients with or without strongyloidiasis, and evaluated the influence of Strongyloides stercoralis treatment on the immune response and clinical outcomes of HTLV-1 infection. RESULTS: Levels of TNFalpha and IFNgamma were lower in patients coinfected with HTLV-1 and S. stercoralis than in patients with HTLV-1 only (p < 0.05), and there was an increase in TNFalpha levels after anthelmintic treatment. Levels of sIL-2R were higher in patients with HTLV-1 coinfected with S. stercoralis and anthelmintic treatment decreased sIL-2R levels (p < 0.05). The one patient who developed ATLL was coinfected with S. stercoralis. CONCLUSION: These data show that helminthic infection has a modulatory role in HTLV-1 infection and that S. stercoralis may be a cofactor in the development of ATLL.","['Salles, Fernanda', 'Bacellar, Andrea', 'Amorim, Mirla', 'Orge, Gloria', 'Sundberg, Michael', 'Lima, Marcia', 'Santos, Silvane', 'Porto, Aurelia', 'Carvalho, Edgar']","['Salles F', 'Bacellar A', 'Amorim M', 'Orge G', 'Sundberg M', 'Lima M', 'Santos S', 'Porto A', 'Carvalho E']","['Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, BA, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,7506129,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anthelmintics/*therapeutic use', 'Coinfection', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood/immunology', 'Strongyloides stercoralis/immunology', 'Strongyloidiasis/blood/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*blood/immunology']",PMC3735360,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'HTLV-1', 'Interleukin-2 receptor', 'Leukemia', 'Strongyloides stercoralis', 'sIL-2R']",2013/07/12 06:00,2014/06/06 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['trt052 [pii]', '10.1093/trstmh/trt052 [doi]']",ppublish,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2013 Aug;107(8):526-9. doi: 10.1093/trstmh/trt052.,"['R01 AI079238/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-079238/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Still, surprisingly little is known about gene expression signatures of differentiating stem cells at the boundaries between regions. We thus combined inducible gene expression with a microfluidic technology to pattern gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells. Regional depletion of the Nanog transcriptional regulator was achieved through the exposure of cells to microfluidic gradients of morphogens. In this way, we established pluripotency-differentiation boundaries between Nanog expressing cells (pluripotency zone) and Nanog suppressed cells (early differentiation zone) within the same cell population, with a gradient of Nanog expression across the individual cell colonies, to serve as a mimic of the developmental process. Using this system, we identified strong interactions between Nanog and its target genes by constructing a network with Nanog as the root and the measured levels of gene expression in each region. Gene expression patterns at the pluripotency-differentiation boundaries recreated in vitro were similar to those in the developing blastocyst. This approach to the study of cellular commitment at the boundaries between gene expression domains, a phenomenon critical for understanding of early development, has potential to benefit fundamental research of stem cells and their application in regenerative medicine.","['Zhang, Yue Shelby', 'Sevilla, Ana', 'Wan, Leo Q', 'Lemischka, Ihor R', 'Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana']","['Zhang YS', 'Sevilla A', 'Wan LQ', 'Lemischka IR', 'Vunjak-Novakovic G']","['Department for Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microfluidics', 'Models, Biological', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC3795787,['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'Embryonic stem cells', 'Experimental models', 'Pluripotency', 'Stem cell-microenvironment interactions', 'Technology', 'Tissue regeneration']",2013/07/12 06:00,2014/05/08 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1468 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2013 Sep;31(9):1806-15. doi: 10.1002/stem.1468.,"['R21 EB015888/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'EB002520/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 RR026244/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'GM078465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'EB015888/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB002520/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM078465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) AlphaMed Press.'],,['NIHMS511339'],,,,,,,,

Can DIC scores predict bleeding in APL?,652,10.1007/s12032-013-0652-2 [doi],"Predicting outcome with a scoring system should be interpreted with caution. In the application of the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring system, a key point is to use well-established cutoff values for the variables. In the article by Mitrovic et al., activated partial thromboplastin time was presented by seconds, while prothrombin time (PT) was expressed as percentage. Such expressions appear confusing and contradictory. In the DIC scoring system, scoring of PT is determined by prolongation in seconds. I cannot see the reason to use the percentage of PT in this article. Furthermore, the PT cutoff was defined as 50%, which may be entirely arbitrary. We had conducted an investigation in our hospital cohort. We had analyzed our cohort by the chi-square method to determine the correlation between DIC scores and bleeding events. We found no relationship between scores and events of bleeding or fatal bleeding. However, reanalysis using a cutoff DIC >==6 revealed a marginally significant difference in bleeding risk between high-score and low-score patients (P = 0.046). The difference was insignificant for life-threatening bleeding. While our experience appears to support authors' conclusion that DIC score >==6 is associated with bleeding in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, we remain skeptical in regard to such manipulations. We believe subsequent studies on a large-scale basis or more accumulated data critically reviewed by experts are needed to shed lights on this important issue.","['Chang, Hung']",['Chang H'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130711,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*physiopathology', 'Hemorrhage/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Risk']",,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2014/04/18 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0652-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2013;30(3):652. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0652-2.

It is difficult to determine whether a specific constellation of lesions observed across a cohort of multiple tumors provides statistically significant evidence that the lesions target a set of genes that may be located across different chromosomes but yet are all involved in a single specific biological process or function. RESULTS: We introduce the genomic random interval (GRIN) statistical model and analysis method that evaluates the statistical significance of the abundance of genomic lesions that overlap a specific locus or a pre-defined set of biologically related loci. The GRIN model retains certain biologically important properties of genomic lesions that are ignored by other methods. In a simulation study and two example analyses of leukemia genomic lesion data, GRIN more effectively identified important loci as significant than did three methods based on a permutation-of-markers model. GRIN also identified biologically relevant pathways with a significant abundance of lesions in both examples.

Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer-normal sequencing datasets are VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer-normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm. RESULTS: Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.

The demonstration that small-molecule ABL kinase inhibitors could effectively treat chronic myeloid leukaemia opened the door to the era of targeted cancer therapies. Recent reports have uncovered roles for ABL kinases in solid tumours. Enhanced ABL expression and activation in some solid tumours, together with altered cell polarity, invasion or growth induced by activated ABL kinases, suggest that drugs targeting these kinases may be useful for treating selected solid tumours.","['Greuber, Emileigh K', 'Smith-Pearson, Pameeka', 'Wang, Jun', 'Pendergast, Ann Marie']","['Greuber EK', 'Smith-Pearson P', 'Wang J', 'Pendergast AM']","['Department of Pharmacology & Cancer Biology, Duke University School of Medicine, BOX 3813, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20130711,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to examine the reliability, validity, and clinical feasibility of several VIPN measures for use in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Children (n = 65) aged 1 to 18 years receiving vincristine at 4 academic centers participated in the study. Baseline and pre-vincristine administration VIPN assessments were obtained using the Total Neuropathy Score-Pediatric Vincristine (TNS(c)-PV), the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, the Balis grading scale, and the FACES Pain Scale. The TNS-PV scores (n = 806) were obtained over 15 weeks. Blood was obtained at several time points to quantify pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for a reduced TNS-PV scale was .84. The TNS-PV scores correlated with cumulative vincristine dosage (r = 0.53, P = 0.01), pharmacokinetic parameters (r = 0.41, P = 0.05), and grading scale scores (r range = 0.46-0.52, P = .01). FACES scores correlated with the TNS-PV neuropathic pain item (r = 0.48; P = .01) and were attainable in all ages. A 2-item V-Rex score (vibration and reflex items) was the most responsive to change (effect size = 0.65, P < 0.001). The TNS-PV scores were attainable in 95% of children 6 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: The TNS-PV is reliable and valid for measuring VIPN. It is sensitive to change over time (15 weeks) and feasible for use in children 6 years or older. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The TNS-PV may be a useful tool for assessing vincristine toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Lavoie Smith, Ellen M', 'Li, Lang', 'Hutchinson, Raymond J', 'Ho, Richard', 'Burnette, W Bryan', 'Wells, Elizabeth', 'Bridges, Celia', 'Renbarger, Jamie']","['Lavoie Smith EM', 'Li L', 'Hutchinson RJ', 'Ho R', 'Burnette WB', 'Wells E', 'Bridges C', 'Renbarger J']","['School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. ellenls@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nursing Assessment', 'Pain Measurement/*nursing', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/*nursing', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*nursing', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tissue Distribution', 'United States', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",PMC3951303,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e318299ad23 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2013 Sep-Oct;36(5):E49-60. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e318299ad23.,"['3UL 1RR025761-02S5/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 PAR-08-248-0132428/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 HD062484/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA146882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM099924/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS487762'],,,,,,,,

Prediction of severe aGvHD as early as possible is crucial to allow timely initiation of treatment. Here we report on a multicentre validation of an aGvHD-specific urinary proteomic classifier (aGvHD_MS17) in 423 patients. Samples (n=1106) were collected prospectively between day +7 and day +130 and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line to mass spectrometry. Integration of aGvHD_MS17 analysis with demographic and clinical variables using a logistic regression model led to correct classification of patients developing severe aGvHD 14 days before any clinical signs with 82.4% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity. Multivariate regression analysis showed that aGvHD_MS17 positivity was the only strong predictor for aGvHD grade III or IV (P<0.0001). The classifier consists of 17 peptides derived from albumin, beta2-microglobulin, CD99, fibronectin and various collagen alpha-chains, indicating inflammation, activation of T cells and changes in the extracellular matrix as early signs of GvHD-induced organ damage.

Its significance in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma treated with the novel regimen SMILE was investigated. EBV DNA was quantified with a World Health Organization EBV standard in 910 plasma samples collected during 230 courses of SMILE in 56 patients. Median presentation EBV DNA was 1900 (0-1.4 x 10(7)) IU/ml. Presentation EBV DNA was significantly associated with tumor load and treatment response. To examine lymphoma chemosensitivity, EBV DNA changes after SMILE were evaluated. EBV DNA after SMILE (I) significantly correlated with tumor load and treatment response. Two dynamic parameters were further analyzed: negative EBV DNA after SMILE (I) and EBV DNA change patterns during treatment (A: persistently undetectable; B: persistently detectable<presentation; C: persistently detectable>presentation). Negative EBV DNA after SMILE (I) and pattern A EBV DNA change significantly correlated with lower tumor load and superior outcome. Multivariate analysis involving presentation features, international prognostic index (IPI), Korean prognostic score and EBV DNA parameters showed that negative EBV DNA after SMILE (I) had the most significant impact (P<0.001) on overall survival and pattern A EBV DNA change had the most significant impact (P=0.002) on disease-free survival.

Although MDS can transform into leukemia, most of the morbidity experienced by these patients is due to chronically low blood counts. Conventional cytotoxic agents used to treat MDS have yielded some encouraging results but are characterized by many adverse effects in the predominantly elderly patient population. Targeted interventions aimed at reversing the bone marrow failure and increasing the peripheral blood counts would be advantageous in this cohort of patients. Studies have demonstrated over-activated signaling of myelo-suppressive cytokines such as TGF-beta, TNF-alpha and Interferons in MDS hematopoietic stem cells. Targeting these signaling cascades could be potentially therapeutic in MDS. The p38 MAP kinase pathway, which is constitutively activated in MDS, is an example of cytokine stimulated kinase that promotes aberrant apoptosis of stem and progenitor cells in MDS. ARRY-614 and SCIO-469 are p38 MAPK inhibitors that have been used in clinical trials and have shown activity in a subset of MDS patients. TGF-beta signaling has been therapeutically targeted by small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta receptor kinase, LY-2157299, with encouraging preclinical results. Apart from TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibition, members of TGF-beta super family and BMP ligands have also been targeted by ligand trap compounds like Sotatercept (ACE-011) and ACE-536. The multikinase inhibitor, ON-01910.Na (Rigosertib) has demonstrated early signs of efficacy in reducing the percentage of leukemic blasts and is in advanced stages of clinical testing. Temsirolimus, Deforolimus and other mTOR inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials and have shown preclinical efficacy in CMML. EGF receptor inhibitors, Erlotinib and Gefitinib have shown efficacy in small trials that may be related to off target effects. Cell cycle regulator inhibitors such as Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (Tipifarnib, Lonafarnib) and MEK inhibitor (GSK1120212) have shown acceptable toxicity profiles in small studies and efforts are underway to select mutational subgroups of MDS and AML that may benefit from these inhibitors. Altogether, these studies show that targeting various signal transduction pathways that regulate hematopoiesis offers promising therapeutic potential in this disease. Future studies in combination with high resolution correlative studies will clarify the subgroup specific efficacies of these agents.","['Bachegowda, Lohith', 'Gligich, Oleg', 'Mantzaris, Ionnis', 'Schinke, Carolina', 'Wyville, Dale', 'Carrillo, Tatiana', 'Braunschweig, Ira', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Verma, Amit']","['Bachegowda L', 'Gligich O', 'Mantzaris I', 'Schinke C', 'Wyville D', 'Carrillo T', 'Braunschweig I', 'Steidl U', 'Verma A']","['Division of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130710,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC3716523,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-50 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jul 10;6:50. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the Mayo Clinic CLL Database to identify patients with newly diagnosed CLL between January 2000 and July 2011. Individuals who developed biopsy-proven RS during follow-up were identified. After a median follow-up of 4 years, 37/1641 (2.3%) CLL patients developed RS. The rate of RS was approximately 0.5%/year. Risk of RS was associated with advanced Rai stage at diagnosis (P < 0.001), high-risk genetic abnormalitites on fluorescence in situ hybridization (P < 0.0001), unmutated IGHV (P = 0.003), and expression of ZAP70 (P = 0.02) and CD38 (P = 0.001). The rate of RS doubled in patients after treatment for CLL (1%/year). Stereotyped B-cell receptors (odds-ratio = 4.2; P = 0.01) but not IGHV4-39 family usage was associated with increased risk of RS. Treatment with combination of purine analogues and alkylating agents increased the risk of RS three-fold (odds-ratio = 3.26, P = 0.0003). Median survival after RS diagnosis was 2.1 years. The RS prognosis score stratified patients into three risk groups with median survivals of 0.5 years, 2.1 years and not reached. Both underlying characteristics of the CLL clone and subsequent CLL therapy influence the risk of RS. Survival after RS remains poor and new therapies are needed.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Ding, Wei', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Macon, William R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Parikh SA', 'Rabe KG', 'Call TG', 'Zent CS', 'Habermann TM', 'Ding W', 'Leis JF', 'Schwager SM', 'Hanson CA', 'Macon WR', 'Kay NE', 'Slager SL', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130711,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC4098845,['NOTNLM'],"['Richter syndrome survival score', 'aggressive lymphoma', 'purine analogues', 'stem cell transplantation', 'transformation']",2013/07/12 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12458 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Sep;162(6):774-82. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12458.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety profile of Mitoxantrone in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS), and worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Overall, 509 patients (395 SPMS, 81 worsening RRMS, 33 PRMS) were enrolled and treated at 46 multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment centers located in the US. Patients received Mitoxantrone in accordance with the package insert every 3 months. During the treatment phase, patients received laboratory workups and cardiac monitoring every 3 months and then annually for a total of 5 years. RESULTS: Five hundred and nine subjects were enrolled in this trial and received at least one infusion of Mitoxantrone. Overall, 172 (33.8%) completed the 5-year trial (i.e., participated for 5 years +/- 3 months [treatment + follow-up]); 337 (66.2%) did not complete the 5-year trial. Annual follow-up data were available for 250 of 509 enrolled patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction reduction under 50% was reported in 27 (5.3%) patients during the treatment phase (n = 509) and 14 (5.6%) patients during the annual follow-up phase (n = 250). Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure were observed in 10 (2.0%) patients (six during treatment phase and four during the annual follow-up phase). Post-hoc analyses of the risk for cardiotoxicity outcomes revealed that cumulative dose exposure is the primary risk factor associated with the risk of cardiac toxicity with Mitoxantrone. Therapy-related leukemia was reported in three (0.6%) patients who received total cumulative Mitoxantrone doses of 73.5 mg/m(2), 107.3 mg/m(2), and 97.1 mg/m(2) respectively. During the treatment phase, persistent amenorrhea developed in 22% (28/128) of women with regular menses and 51% (25/49) of women with irregular menses at baseline. During the annual follow-up phase, persistent amenorrhea developed in 5% (4/73) of women with regular menses at baseline. CONCLUSION: RENEW results are consistent with the known safety profile of Mitoxantrone, and provide additional long-term safety data for Mitoxantrone in MS patients.","['Rivera, Victor M', 'Jeffery, Douglas R', 'Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca', 'Bock, Daena', 'Dangond, Fernando']","['Rivera VM', 'Jeffery DR', 'Weinstock-Guttman B', 'Bock D', 'Dangond F']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130711,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3710498,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2377-13-80 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2377-13-80 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2013 Jul 11;13:80. doi: 10.1186/1471-2377-13-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, multicenter trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in patients with APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk (white-cell count, </=10x10(9) per liter). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ATRA plus arsenic trioxide for induction and consolidation therapy or standard ATRA-idarubicin induction therapy followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy and ATRA. The study was designed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5%. RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in all 77 patients in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group who could be evaluated (100%) and in 75 of 79 patients in the ATRA-chemotherapy group (95%) (P=0.12). The median follow-up was 34.4 months. Two-year event-free survival rates were 97% in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group and 86% in the ATRA-chemotherapy group (95% confidence interval for the difference, 2 to 22 percentage points; P<0.001 for noninferiority and P=0.02 for superiority of ATRA-arsenic trioxide). Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide (P=0.02). As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy, ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL.

An absolute lymphocyte count < 500/muL was defined as lymphocytopenia. There was a significant relationship between lymphocytopenia and advanced disease at allo-HSCT or corticosteroid administration within 100 days. Lymphocytopenia on day 100 (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-4.5; p = 0.006) and advanced disease at allo-HSCT (HR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.9; p = 0.005) were prognostic factors for overall survival by multivariate analysis. Advanced disease was significantly associated with relapse (HR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.5-5.4; p = 0.002), while lymphocytopenia was an independent predictor of non-relapse mortality (HR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1-6.8; p = 0.027). These results suggest that lymphocyte recovery on day 100 may be an important predictor of late complications in patients receiving allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies.","['Yamamoto, Wataru', 'Ogusa, Eriko', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa']","['Yamamoto W', 'Ogusa E', 'Matsumoto K', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Kanamori H']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center , Yokohama , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130828,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*mortality/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/12 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.823491 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 May;55(5):1113-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.823491.

The anti-CD22 immunoconjugate, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and the anti-CD19 BiTE((R)) antibody, blinatumomab, have demonstrated impressive single agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.

METHODS: Human leukemia cell line NB4 was cultured in vitro. The NB4 cells were treated with PSO extracted from Chinese medicine psoralea fruits at different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 microL) plus UVA of wave length 360 nm at different irradiation time points (0 and 5 min). The apoptosis ratio was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The ultrastructure changes were observed using transmission electron microscope (TEM). The expressions of Caspase-8 and Caspase-8 protein were detected by immunocytochemical method (ICC). RESULTS: After treatment of PSO at different concentrations with a 0 and 5-min exposure of UVA, the apoptosis rate of NB4 cells increased dose-and time-dependently, and was up to peak after treatment of PSO at 40 microg/mL with 5-min exposure of UVA. An interaction was shown between the two factors (P <0. 01). There were obvious morphological apoptosis of NB4 cells under TEM after treated with PUVA. The expressions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 protein were up-regulated by PSO, UVA, and PUVA, but the effects of PUVA on Caspase-3 protein were stronger than PSO and UVA at 12 h time-dependently (P <0.01).An interaction was shown between the concentration of PSO and time of UVA (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The optimal combination of PUVA was PSO in 40 microg/mL and 5-min exposure of UVA.

We have determined that the incompatibility between HIV-1 and GaLV Env is primarily caused by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu, which prevents GaLV Env from being incorporated into particles. We have characterized the 'Vpu sensitivity sequence' in the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of GaLV Env using a chimeric MLV Env with the GaLV Env CTD (MLV/GaLV Env). Vpu sensitivity is dependent on an alpha helix with a positively charged face containing at least one Lysine. In the present study, we utilized functional complementation to address whether all the three helices in the CTD of an Env trimer have to contain the Vpu sensitivity motif for the trimer to be modulated by Vpu. Taking advantage of the functional complementation of the binding defective (D84K) and fusion defective (L493V) MLV and MLV/GaLV Env mutants, we were able to assay the activity of mixed trimers containing both MLV and GaLV CTDs.

However, trimers containing an Env with the GaLV CTD and an Env with no CTD remained functional but were resistant to Vpu.

Recent evidence suggests that brain networks constructed in this manner are inherently more clustered than random networks of the same size and degree. Thus, null networks constructed by randomizing topology are not a good choice for benchmarking small-world parameters of these networks. In the present report, we investigated the influence of choice of null networks on small-world parameters of gray matter correlation networks in healthy individuals and survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three types of null networks were studied: 1) networks constructed by topology randomization (TOP), 2) networks matched to the distributional properties of the observed covariance matrix (HQS), and 3) networks generated from correlation of randomized input data (COR). The results revealed that the choice of null network not only influences the estimated small-world parameters, it also influences the results of between-group differences in small-world parameters. In addition, at higher network densities, the choice of null network influences the direction of group differences in network measures. Our data suggest that the choice of null network is quite crucial for interpretation of group differences in small-world parameters of structural correlation networks. We argue that none of the available null models is perfect for estimation of small-world parameters for correlation networks and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the selected model should be carefully considered with respect to obtained network measures.","['Hosseini, S M Hadi', 'Kesler, Shelli R']","['Hosseini SM', 'Kesler SR']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America. hosseiny@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130628,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Functional Neuroimaging', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Net/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3696118,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067354 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-01956 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 28;8(6):e67354. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067354.

It causes aberrant gene regulation and leukemic transformation through mechanisms that are not fully understood. NUP98-HOXA9 consists of an N-terminal portion of the nucleoporin NUP98 that contains many FG repeats fused to the DNA-binding homeodomain of HOXA9. We used a Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid assay to identify proteins that interact with NUP98-HOXA9. We identified Dynein Light Chain 1 (DYNLT1), an integral 14 KDa protein subunit of the large microtubule-based cytoplasmic dynein complex, as an interaction partner of NUP98-HOXA9. Binding was confirmed by in vitro pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays and the FG repeat region of NUP98-HOXA9 was shown to be essential for the interaction. RNAi-mediated knockdown of DYNLT1 resulted in reduction of the ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to activate transcription and also inhibited the ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to induce proliferation of primary human hematopoietic CD34+ cells. DYNLT1 also showed a strong interaction with wild-type NUP98 and other nucleoporins containing FG repeats. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that DYNLT1 localizes primarily to the nuclear periphery, where it co-localizes with the nuclear pore complex, and to the cytoplasm. Deletion studies showed that the interactions of the nucleoporins with DYNLT1 are dependent predominantly on the C-terminal half of the DYNLT1. These data show for the first time that DYNLT1 interacts with nucleoporins and plays a role in the dysregulation of gene expression and induction of hematopoietic cell proliferation by the leukemogenic nucleoporin fusion, NUP98-HOXA9.","['Sarma, Nayan J', 'Yaseen, Nabeel R']","['Sarma NJ', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130626,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DYNLT1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 3.6.4.2 (Dyneins)']",IM,"['Dyneins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Pore/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3694108,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/07/11 06:01,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067032 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-06143 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 26;8(6):e67032. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067032.

FLT3 is a commonly mutated gene found in AML patients. In clinical trials, the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation significantly correlates with an increased risk of relapse and dismal overall survival. Therefore, activated FLT3 is a promising molecular target for AML therapies. In this study, we have shown that green tea polyphenols including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) suppress the proliferation of AML cells. Interestingly, EGCG, EGC and ECG showed the inhibition of FLT3 expression in cell lines harboring FLT3 mutations. In the THP-1 cells harboring FLT3 wild-type, EGCG showed the suppression of cell proliferation but did not suppress the expression of FLT3 even at the concentration that suppress 100% cell proliferation. Moreover, EGCG-, EGC-and ECG-treated cells showed the suppression of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation. Altogether, we suggest that green tea polyphenols could serve as reagents for treatment or prevention of leukemia harboring FLT3 mutations.","['Ly, Bui Thi Kim', 'Chi, Hoang Thanh', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Hara, Yukihiko', 'Nakano, Kazumi', 'Sato, Yuko', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Ly BT', 'Chi HT', 'Yamagishi M', 'Kano Y', 'Hara Y', 'Nakano K', 'Sato Y', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130620,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '92587OVD8Z (epicatechin gallate)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'HEJ6575V1X (gallocatechol)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3688791,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066378 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39860 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 20;8(6):e66378. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066378.

Thus, it is needed to clarify whether shikonin could cause necroptosis in glioma cells and investigate its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Shikonin and rat C6 glioma cell line and Human U87 glioma cell line were used in this study. The cellular viability was assayed by MTT. Flow cytometry with annexin V-FITC and PI double staining was used to analyze cellular death modes. Morphological alterations in C6 glioma cells treated with shikoinin were evaluated by electronic transmission microscopy and fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 and PI double staining. The level of reactive oxygen species was assessed by using redox-sensitive dye DCFH-DA. The expressional level of necroptosis associated protein RIP-1 was analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: Shikonin induced cell death in C6 and U87 glioma cells in a dose and time dependent manner. The cell death in C6 and U87 glioma cells could be inhibited by necroptosis inhibitor necrotatin-1, not by pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Shikonin treated C6 glioma cells presented electron-lucent cytoplasm, loss of plasma membrane integrity and intact nuclear membrane in morphology. The increased ROS level caused by shikonin was attenuated by necrostatin-1 and blocking ROS by anti-oxidant NAC rescued shikonin-induced cell death in both C6 and U87 glioma cells. Moreover, the expressional level of RIP-1 was up-regulated by shikonin in a dose and time dependent manner as well, but NAC suppressed RIP-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the cell death caused by shikonin in C6 and U87 glioma cells was mainly via necroptosis. Moreover, not only RIP-1 pathway, but also oxidative stress participated in the activation of shikonin induced necroptosis.","['Huang, Chuanjiang', 'Luo, Yinan', 'Zhao, Jingwei', 'Yang, Fuwei', 'Zhao, Hongwei', 'Fan, Wenhai', 'Ge, Pengfei']","['Huang C', 'Luo Y', 'Zhao J', 'Yang F', 'Zhao H', 'Fan W', 'Ge P']","['Department of Neurosurgery, First Bethune hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AGFG1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Glioma', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Necrosis', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC3695975,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00712 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 28;8(6):e66326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066326.

Of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes expressed in CLL, IGHV1-69 is the most common, and often is expressed with little or no somatic mutation, and restricted IGHD and IGHJ gene usage. We found that antibodies encoded by one particular IGHV1-69 subset, designated CLL69C, with the HCDR3 encoded by the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 and IGHJ6, specifically bound to oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE), which are products of enhanced lipid peroxidation and a major target of innate natural antibodies. Specifically, CLL69C bound immunodominant OSE adducts termed MAA (malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde-adducts), which are found on apoptotic cells, inflammatory tissues, and atherosclerotic lesions. It also reacted specifically with MAA-specific peptide mimotopes. Light chain shuffling indicated that non-stochastically paired L chain of IGLV3-9 contributes to the antigen binding of CLL69C. A nearly identical CLL69C Ig heavy chain was identified from an MAA-enriched umbilical cord phage displayed Fab library, and a derived Fab with the same HCDR3 rearrangement displayed identical MAA-binding properties. These data support the concept that OSE (MAA-epitopes), which are ubiquitous products of inflammation, may play a role in clonal selection and expansion of CLL B cells.","['Que, Xuchu', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Amir, Shahzada', 'Hartvigsen, Karsten', 'Hansen, Lotte F', 'Woelkers, Douglas', 'Tsimikas, Sotirios', 'Binder, Christoph J', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Witztum, Joseph L']","['Que X', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Amir S', 'Hartvigsen K', 'Hansen LF', 'Woelkers D', 'Tsimikas S', 'Binder CJ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Witztum JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. xque@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130620,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'GO1N1ZPR3B (Acetaldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetaldehyde/*immunology', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/immunology', 'Malondialdehyde/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plaque, Atherosclerotic/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits']",PMC3688726,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0065203 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-11185 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 20;8(6):e65203. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0065203.

Viral DNA is known to integrate in the human genome, but the integration of bacterial DNA has not been described. Using publicly available sequence data from the human genome project, the 1000 Genomes Project, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we examined bacterial DNA integration into the human somatic genome. Here we present evidence that bacterial DNA integrates into the human somatic genome through an RNA intermediate, and that such integrations are detected more frequently in (a) tumors than normal samples, (b) RNA than DNA samples, and (c) the mitochondrial genome than the nuclear genome. Hundreds of thousands of paired reads support random integration of Acinetobacter-like DNA in the human mitochondrial genome in acute myeloid leukemia samples. Numerous read pairs across multiple stomach adenocarcinoma samples support specific integration of Pseudomonas-like DNA in the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR of four proto-oncogenes that are up-regulated in their transcription, consistent with conversion to an oncogene. These data support our hypothesis that bacterial integrations occur in the human somatic genome and may play a role in carcinogenesis. We anticipate that the application of our approach to additional cancer genome projects will lead to the more frequent detection of bacterial DNA integrations in tumors that are in close proximity to the human microbiome.","['Riley, David R', 'Sieber, Karsten B', 'Robinson, Kelly M', 'White, James Robert', 'Ganesan, Ashwinkumar', 'Nourbakhsh, Syrus', 'Dunning Hotopp, Julie C']","['Riley DR', 'Sieber KB', 'Robinson KM', 'White JR', 'Ganesan A', 'Nourbakhsh S', 'Dunning Hotopp JC']","['Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130620,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Bacteria/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics', '*Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",PMC3688693,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003107 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-12-01821 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2013;9(6):e1003107. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003107.

It is widely assumed that initiation and pathogenesis of AML following Bz exposure (Bz-AML) is similar or identical to therapy-related AML (t-AML), in which clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, including aneuploidy, are initiating events. However, this assumption is not supported by studies reporting actual disease outcomes together with cytogenetic analyses. Here, using clinically relevant cytogenetic, hematologic, and epidemiological methods, we directly show for 722 consecutive AML cases that the pattern of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities encountered in Bz-exposed cases (n = 78) more closely resembles de novo-AML than t-AML. The prevalence of aneuploidy in Bz-exposed- and de novo-AML cases was identical (23%), and no significant increases in -5/5q- (RR = 0.79) (95% CI: 0.29-2.12) or -7/7q- (RR = 1.27) (95% CI: 0.55-2.92) abnormalities were observed between Bz- vs de novo-AML, respectively. Previous studies have suggested a role for autoimmunity in Bz related MDS including immune mediated inflammatory features and positive responses to immunosuppressive therapy which are indistinguishable from those reported in MDS with low risk of progression to AML. These observations are more consistent with an epigenetic model for initiation of Bz-AML in which altered homeostatic regulation in the bone marrow niche, not direct cytogenetic injury, predominates in the initial development of the leukemic stem cell phenotype, a mechanism biologically distinct from previous models of clonal cytogenetic injury. These findings are important for further understanding the biological basis of AML, particularly in environmental and occupational settings.","['Irons, Richard D', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Ryder, John', 'Kerzic, Patrick J']","['Irons RD', 'Chen Y', 'Wang X', 'Ryder J', 'Kerzic PJ']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

In vitro studies demonstrated that bosutinib displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility, suggesting that concomitant administration of agents that alter gastric pH could affect bosutinib absorption. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of lansoprazole, a gastric proton pump inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of bosutinib. METHODS: This open-label, non-randomized, phase I study involved inpatients and outpatients at a single site. The study participants were healthy men or women of non-childbearing potential aged 18-50 years. Each subject received bosutinib 400 mg on Day 1, lansoprazole 60 mg on Day 14, and bosutinib 400 mg co-administered with lansoprazole 60 mg on Day 15 under fasting conditions. The main outcome measure was the effect of multiple doses of lansoprazole on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral dose of bosutinib. RESULTS: A total of 24 healthy male subjects were enrolled. Co-administration with lansoprazole decreased the mean maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of bosutinib from 70.2 to 42.9 ng/mL, and the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 1,940 to 1,470 ng.h/mL. Log-transformed bosutinib pharmacokinetic parameters indicated significant between-treatment differences; the least squares geometric mean ratio for C(max) was 54 % (95 % CI 42-70) and for AUC was 74 % (95 % CI 60-90). Mean apparent total body clearance from plasma after oral administration increased from 237 to 330 L/h, and the median time to reach Cmax increased from 5 to 6 h, although this change may be related to decreased bosutinib absorption when combined with lansoprazole. When co-administered with lansoprazole, bosutinib maintained an acceptable safety profile, which was primarily characterized by diarrhea (33 %), headache (21 %), and nausea (13 %). One subject experienced serious adverse events of diverticulitis, gastritis, and duodenitis after co-administration; however, no participant withdrew because of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that bosutinib absorption may be reduced when co-administered with lansoprazole or other proton pump inhibitors. Caution should be used with such drug combinations, as subtherapeutic exposure of bosutinib may limit its clinical antitumor activity; short-acting antacids are recommended instead.","['Abbas, Richat', 'Leister, Cathie', 'Sonnichsen, Daryl']","['Abbas R', 'Leister C', 'Sonnichsen D']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA. richat.abbas-borhan@pfizer.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0K5C5T2QPG (Lansoprazole)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Female', 'Half-Life', '*Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Lansoprazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40261-013-0103-z [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2013 Aug;33(8):589-95. doi: 10.1007/s40261-013-0103-z.,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00952913'],,,,,

Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) contribute to stroma in part as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), but a complete understanding of how MSC contribute to the tumor stroma is lacking. In this study, we show how CAF phenotypes rely upon MSC expression of the multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein CD44, a putative stem cell marker. Through bone marrow transplantation experiments in a transgenic mouse model of cancer, we determined that CD44 deficiency leads to a relative reduction in the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to tumor stroma. CD44 attenuation in MSC limited their expression of CAF markers induced by tumor conditioning, and these MSC migrated poorly and provided weak angiogenic support compared with wild-type MSC. These defects were linked to deficiencies in the ability of CD44-attenuated MSC to transcriptionally upregulate Twist expression. Together, our results establish that CD44 expression contributes to critical functions in the tumor stroma.","['Spaeth, Erika L', 'Labaff, Adam M', 'Toole, Bryan P', 'Klopp, Ann', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Marini, Frank C']","['Spaeth EL', 'Labaff AM', 'Toole BP', 'Klopp A', 'Andreeff M', 'Marini FC']","['Departments of Leukemia, Molecular and Cellular Oncology, and Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130709,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3767181,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-0087 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0087 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Sep 1;73(17):5347-59. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0087.

The primary objectives were to describe the incidence and characteristics of CDI in children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The secondary objective was to describe factors associated with CDI. METHOD: We performed a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of children with de novo AML and evaluated CDI. Recurrence, sepsis and infection-related death were examined. Factors associated with CDI were also evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-three CDI occurred in 37 of 341 (10.9%) patients during 42 of 1277 (3.3%) courses of chemotherapy. There were 6 children with multiple episodes of CDI. Three infections were associated with sepsis, and no children died of CDI. Only 2 children had an associated enterocolitis.

Here we have validated, for the first time, the effectiveness and the possible mechanism of action of young leaf extracts of Shorea robusta, used by two distinct tribes of India, and its isolated compounds as a topical formulation in three wound models in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioactivity-guided study of the active extract resulted in the isolation of two known compounds. The prepared ointment containing extracts (2.5 and 5%, w/w), fractions (5% w/w) and isolated compounds (0.25% w/w) were evaluated on excision, incision and dead space wound models in rats by the rate of wound closure, period of epithelialisation, tensile strength, granulation tissue weight, hydroxyproline content and histopathology. RESULTS: The animals treated with the extracts and fractions (5%) showed significant reduction in wound area 96.55 and 96.41% with faster epithelialisation (17.50 and 17.86), while the isolated compounds bergenin and ursolic acid heal the wound faster, but complete epithelialisation with 100% wound contraction was evident with 5% povidone-iodine group on 18th post-wounding day. Moreover, the tensile strength of incision wound, granuloma tissue weight, and hydroxyproline content was significantly increased in both the extract and compound(s) treated animals. Furthermore, the tissue histology of animals treated with the isolated compound(s) showed complete epithelialisation with increased collagenation, similar to povidone-iodine group. CONCLUSION: Thus, our results validated the traditional use of Shorea robusta young leaves in wound management.","['Mukherjee, Hemanta', 'Ojha, Durbadal', 'Bharitkar, Yogesh P', 'Ghosh, Soma', 'Mondal, Supriya', 'Kaity, Sudipta', 'Dutta, Shanta', 'Samanta, Amalesh', 'Chatterjee, Tapan K', 'Chakrabarti, Sekhar', 'Mondal, Nirup B', 'Chattopadhyay, Debprasad']","['Mukherjee H', 'Ojha D', 'Bharitkar YP', 'Ghosh S', 'Mondal S', 'Kaity S', 'Dutta S', 'Samanta A', 'Chatterjee TK', 'Chakrabarti S', 'Mondal NB', 'Chattopadhyay D']","['ICMR Virus Unit, ID & BG Hospital, GB-4, First Floor, 57 Dr Suresh C Banerjee Road, Beliaghata, Kolkata-700010, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130706,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipterocarpaceae/*chemistry', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Stability', '*Ethnopharmacology', 'India', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Skin Irritancy Tests', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Wound Healing/*drug effects', 'Wounds, Penetrating/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['(3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide', 'AE', 'Aqueous extract', 'BP', 'British Pharmacopoeia', 'COX', 'Cyclooxygenase', 'DMSO', 'Dimethyl sulfoxide', 'Epithelialisation', 'Ethnomedicine', 'FBS', 'FTIR', 'Fetal bovine serum', 'Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy', 'Hb', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line', 'IFN-gamma', 'IL', 'IR', 'Inducible nitric oxide synthase', 'Infrared', 'Interferon- gamma', 'Interleukin', 'LPS', 'Lipopolysaccharide', 'ME', 'MS', 'MTT', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Methanol extract', 'N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide', 'NMR', 'NO', 'NS-398', 'Nitric oxide', 'PGE', 'PMA', 'Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate', 'Prostaglandin', 'RBC', 'RPMI', 'Red blood corpuscles', 'Roswell park memorial institute medium', 'Shorea robusta', 'T helper', 'THP', 'TLC', 'TNF-alpha', 'Tensile strength', 'Th', 'Thin layer chromatography', 'Tumour necrosis factor-alpha', 'USP', 'United State Pharmacopoeia', 'WBC', 'White blood corpuscles', 'Wound healing', 'iNOS', 'nuclear magnetic resonance']",2013/07/11 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(13)00478-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2013.06.045 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2013 Aug 26;149(1):335-43. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.06.045.

We report a randomized comparison of low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) vs the novel nucleoside, clofarabine, in untreated older patients with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 406 patients with de novo (62%), secondary disease (24%), or high-risk MDS (>10% marrow blasts) (15%), median age 74 years, were randomized to LDAC 20 mg twice daily for 10 days every 6 weeks or clofarabine 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, both for up to 4 courses.

Currently, it remains unclear whether a normal capacity for self-renewal is required for acquiring an aberrant self-renewal capacity. Our results in a new conditional transgenic mouse showed that a mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion oncogene, MLL-ENL, at an endogenous-like expression level led to leukemic transformation selectively in a restricted subpopulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through upregulation of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf). Interestingly, forced expression of Plzf itself immortalized HSCs and myeloid progenitors in vitro without upregulation of Hoxa9/Meis1, which are well-known targets of MLL fusion proteins, whereas its mutant lacking the BTB/POZ domain did not. In contrast, depletion of Plzf suppressed the MLL-fusion-induced leukemic transformation of HSCs in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression analyses of human clinical samples showed that a subtype of PLZF-high MLL-rearranged myeloid leukemia cells was closely associated with the gene expression signature of HSCs. These findings suggested that MLL fusion protein enhances the self-renewal potential of normal HSCs to develop leukemia, in part through a Plzf-driven self-renewal program.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Masuya, Masahiro', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Enomoto, Yutaka', 'Miyata, Eri', 'Nakamura, Akihide', 'Ishii, Satomi', 'Suzuki, Kei', 'Shibata-Minoshima, Fumi', 'Katayama, Naoyuki', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya']","['Ono R', 'Masuya M', 'Nakajima H', 'Enomoto Y', 'Miyata E', 'Nakamura A', 'Ishii S', 'Suzuki K', 'Shibata-Minoshima F', 'Katayama N', 'Kitamura T', 'Nosaka T']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)54282-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-456665 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 15;122(7):1271-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-456665.

Strategies to improve outcome and prevent relapse are therefore required. Immunotherapy with antigen-specific T cells can have antileukemic activity without the toxicities seen with intensive chemotherapy, and therefore represents an attractive strategy to improve the outcome of high-risk patients with ALL. We explored the feasibility of generating tumor antigen-specific T cells ex vivo from the peripheral blood of 50 patients with ALL [26 National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk and 24 standard-risk] receiving maintenance therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with complete peptide libraries of WT1, Survivin, MAGE-A3, and PRAME, antigens frequently expressed on ALL blasts. RESULTS: T-cell lines were successfully expanded from all patients, despite low lymphocyte counts and irrespective of NCI risk group. Antigen-specificity was observed in more than 50% of patients after the initial stimulation and increased to more than 90% after three stimulations as assessed in IFN-gamma-enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and (51)Cr-release assays. Moreover, tumor-specific responses were observed by reduction of autologous leukemia blasts in short- and long-term coculture experiments. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of immunotherapy with adoptively transferred autologous tumor antigen-specific T cells to prevent relapse and improve the prognosis of patients with high-risk ALL.","['Weber, Gerrit', 'Caruana, Ignazio', 'Rouce, Rayne H', 'Barrett, A John', 'Gerdemann, Ulrike', 'Leen, Ann M', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Bollard, Catherine M']","['Weber G', 'Caruana I', 'Rouce RH', 'Barrett AJ', 'Gerdemann U', 'Leen AM', 'Rabin KR', 'Bollard CM']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine; The Methodist Hospital; Texas Children's Hospital; Texas Children's Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; and Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130709,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MAGEA3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feasibility Studies', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",PMC3778051,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0955 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0955 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Sep 15;19(18):5079-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0955.

After three days, mean fluorescence intensity and cell division generations of the tumor cells were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: UC-MSCs inhibited the proliferation of HL60, THP1, K562 and RPMI8226 cell lines, but promoted the proliferation of Raji and NCIH929 cell lines. UC-MSCs promoted the proliferation of Jurkat cells only at 1:1 ratio; as for U937 cells, UC-MSCs inhibited the proliferation at 2:1 ratio (UC-MSCs: U937), promoted proliferation at 1:4 and 1:16, whereas had no obvious effect at 1:1.

They have no promoting effects on four leukemic cell lines, but have bidirectional (promotion/inhibition) effects on lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines. The U937 cell line may serve as a good model for the mechanism study of this contradictory phenomenon.","['Pang, Yilin', 'Tang, Yongyong', 'Li, Qian', 'Xie, Jing', 'Zang, Xuefeng', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Chen, Hu']","['Pang Y', 'Tang Y', 'Li Q', 'Xie J', 'Zang X', 'Liu T', 'Zhang B', 'Chen H']","['General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/08/31 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jul;29(7):714-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during CR2 might be effective, but data on the role of HSCT for APL patients after CR2 are limited in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for 57 relapsed APL patients who achieved CR2 in the JALSG APL97 study. Of those, six received autologous (auto)-HSCT, 21 received allogeneic (allo)-HSCT, and 30 received various regimens other than HSCT. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate, overall survival (OS) rate and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were 50.7%, 77.4% and 51.0% in the non-HSCT group, 41.7%, 83.3% and 58.3% in the auto-HSCT group and 71.1%, 76.2% and 9.8% in the allo-HSCT group, respectively. Both the EFS rate and CIR were significantly better in the allo-HSCT group than in other groups. Allo-HSCT appears effective in APL patients in CR2, with a low relapse rate beyond a relatively early transplantation-related mortality (19%). Among older patients (age >/=40 years), the 5-year OS was significantly better in the non-HSCT group than in the HSCT group (78.0% vs 40.5%; P = 0.04). Further prospective studies with larger patient numbers are required to confirm the impact of HSCT alone and in combination with arsenic trioxide on outcomes for patients with APL in CR2.","['Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Asou, Norio', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Hyo, Rie', 'Nomura, Shosaku', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Okada, Masaya', 'Inaguma, Youko', 'Matsuda, Mitsuhiro', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Izumi, Tohru', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Shinagawa, Katsuji', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Fujita H', 'Asou N', 'Iwanaga M', 'Hyo R', 'Nomura S', 'Kiyoi H', 'Okada M', 'Inaguma Y', 'Matsuda M', 'Yamauchi T', 'Ohtake S', 'Izumi T', 'Nakaseko C', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Shinagawa K', 'Takeshita A', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Ohnishi K', 'Miyawaki S', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Yokohama Saiseikai Nanbu Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130805,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC7656542,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12230 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Oct;104(10):1339-45. doi: 10.1111/cas.12230.

CTCs are cancer cells shed from primary tumors; they circulate in the bloodstream, leading to metastasis. The extraordinary rarity of CTCs in the bloodstream makes their isolation a significant technological challenge. Herein, we report the development of a platform combining multivalent DNA aptamer nanospheres with microfluidic devices for efficient isolation of cancer cells from blood. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used as an efficient platform for assembling a number of aptamers for high-efficiency cell capture. Up to 95 aptamers were attached onto each AuNP, resulting in enhanced molecular recognition capability. An increase of 39-fold in binding affinity was confirmed by flow cytometry for AuNP-aptamer conjugates (AuNP-aptamer) when compared with aptamer alone. With a laminar flow flat channel microfluidic device, the capture efficiency of human acute leukemia cells from a cell mixture in buffer increased from 49% using aptamer alone to 92% using AuNP-aptamer. We also employed AuNP-aptamer in a microfluidic device with herringbone mixing microstructures for isolation of leukemia cells in whole blood. The cell capture efficiency was also significantly increased with the AuNP-aptamer over aptamer alone, especially at high flow rates. Our results show that the platform combining DNA nanostructures with microfluidics has a great potential for sensitive isolation of CTCs and is promising for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.","['Sheng, Weian', 'Chen, Tao', 'Tan, Weihong', 'Fan, Z Hugh']","['Sheng W', 'Chen T', 'Tan W', 'Fan ZH']","['Interdisciplinary Microsystems Group, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Florida, PO Box 116250, Gainesville, Florida 32611, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130715,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gold/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanospheres/*chemistry', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating']",PMC3785240,,,2013/07/11 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn4023747 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2013 Aug 27;7(8):7067-76. doi: 10.1021/nn4023747.

Thirty-two patients received chemotherapy alone, and the remaining 50 patients received chemotherapy followed by modified DLI. In patients receiving chemotherapy followed by modified DLI, complete remission rate was significantly higher (64.0% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.000), the incidence of relapse was significantly lower (50.0% vs. 100.0%, P = 0.000), and disease-free survival was significantly improved (36.0% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.000) compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

Besides anti-apoptotic proteins, the microenvironment provides substantial survival signals to CLL leukemic cells. However, in-depth knowledge on the role of individual Bcl-2 family members in the context of the microenvironment is still limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of transcripts and proteins of 18 Bcl-2 family members using an ""apoptosis array microfluidic card"" in primary cells before and after stromal co-cultures. Our data showed that five of six anti-apoptotic members (excluding Bcl-b), two of three pro-apoptotic members (excluding Bok) and six of nine BH3-only members were present at detectable mRNA levels in CLL cells. Importantly, stromal-mediated extended survival of CLL cells was strongly associated with elevated global transcription. Upon co-culturing with stromal cells, there was an early response of an increase in anti- (2/5) and pro-apoptotic protein (3/8) transcripts on day 1, while an increase in anti-apoptotic proteins was observed on day 3, with no significant change in pro-apoptotic proteins.

Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent that is incorporated into RNA as well as DNA. Thus, there is a rationale to its use in patients with AML. We determined whether baseline and/or early changes in the methylation of long interspersed element (LINE)-1 or CDH13 correlate with bone marrow blast clearance, hematological response, or survival in patients with AML treated with azacitidine. METHODS: An open label, phase I/II trial was performed in 40 AML patients (median bone marrow blast count was 42%) unfit for intensive chemotherapy treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/day subcutaneously for 5 days every 4 weeks. Bone marrow mononuclear cell samples were taken on day 0 (pretreatment) and day 15 during the first treatment cycle; LINE-1 and CDH13 methylation levels were quantified by methylation-specific, semiquantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Treatment with azacitidine significantly reduced LINE-1 but not CDH13 methylation levels over the first cycle (P < 0.0001). Absolute LINE-1 methylation levels tended to be lower on day 0 (P = 0.06) and day 15 of cycle 1 (P = 0.03) in patients who went on to achieve subsequent complete remission, partial remission or hematological improvement versus patients with stable disease. However, the decrease in LINE-1 methylation over the first treatment cycle did not correlate with subsequent response (P = 0.31). Baseline methylation levels of LINE-1 or CDH13 did not correlate with disease-related prognostic factors, including cytogenetic risk, relapsed/refractory AML, or presence of NPM1 or FLT3 mutations. No correlation was observed between LINE-1 or CDH13 methylation levels and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Analysis of baseline LINE-1 methylation levels may help identify elderly AML patients who are most likely to respond to azacitidine therapy.","['Cross, Michael', 'Bach, Enrica', 'Tran, Thao', 'Krahl, Rainer', 'Jaekel, Nadja', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Junghanss, Christian', 'Maschmeyer, Georg', 'Al-Ali, Haifa Kathrin']","['Cross M', 'Bach E', 'Tran T', 'Krahl R', 'Jaekel N', 'Niederwieser D', 'Junghanss C', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Al-Ali HK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130620,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC3699298,['NOTNLM'],"['CDH13', 'DNA methylation', 'LINE-1 methylation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'clinical response']",2013/07/10 06:00,2013/07/10 06:01,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S45459 [doi]', 'ott-6-741 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2013 Jun 20;6:741-8. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S45459.

In this study, we further confirmed that valproic acid inhibits the growth of Kasumi-1 cells in a murine xenograft tumor model, and that this occurs via upregulation of histone acetylation in the p21 promoter region, enhancement of p21 expression, suppression of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, blocking of transcription activated by E2F, and induction of G0/G1 arrest.","['Zhang, Zhihua', 'Hao, Changlai', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Liu, Peng', 'Zhao, Lei', 'Zhu, Cuimin', 'Tian, Xia']","['Zhang Z', 'Hao C', 'Wang L', 'Liu P', 'Zhao L', 'Zhu C', 'Tian X']","[""Hematology Department, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130618,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC3699303,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'E2F', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'p21', 'valproic acid']",2013/07/10 06:00,2013/07/10 06:01,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S46135 [doi]', 'ott-6-733 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2013 Jun 18;6:733-40. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S46135.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) detects the genomic RNA of incoming murine leukemia virus (MLV) in endosomes and mediates the antiviral response. However, the RNA-sensing PRR that recognizes the MLV in the cytosol is not fully understood. Here, we definitively demonstrate that zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) acts as a cytosolic RNA sensor, inducing the degradation of the MLV transcripts by the exosome, an RNA degradation system, on RNA granules. Although the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 detect various RNA viruses in the cytosol and induce the type I IFN-dependent antiviral response, RLR loss does not alter the replication efficiency of MLV. In sharp contrast, the loss of ZAP greatly enhances the replication efficiency of MLV. ZAP localizes to RNA granules, where the processing-body and stress-granule proteins assemble. ZAP induces the recruitment of the MLV transcripts and exosome components to the RNA granules. The CCCH-type zinc-finger domains of ZAP, which are RNA-binding motifs, mediate its localization to RNA granules and MLV transcripts degradation by the exosome. Although ZAP was known as a regulator of RIG-I signaling in a human cell line, ZAP deficiency does not affect the RIG-I-dependent production of type I IFN in mouse cells. Thus, ZAP is a unique member of the cytosolic RNA-sensing PRR family that targets and eliminates intracellular RNA viruses independently of TLR and RLR family members.","['Lee, Hanna', 'Komano, Jun', 'Saitoh, Yasunori', 'Yamaoka, Shoji', 'Kozaki, Tatsuya', 'Misawa, Takuma', 'Takahama, Michihiro', 'Satoh, Takashi', 'Takeuchi, Osamu', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Matsuura, Yoshiharu', 'Saitoh, Tatsuya', 'Akira, Shizuo']","['Lee H', 'Komano J', 'Saitoh Y', 'Yamaoka S', 'Kozaki T', 'Misawa T', 'Takahama M', 'Satoh T', 'Takeuchi O', 'Yamamoto N', 'Matsuura Y', 'Saitoh T', 'Akira S']","['Laboratory of Host Defense, World Premier International Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ddx58 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD Box Protein 58)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD Box Protein 58', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', '*Zinc Fingers']",PMC3725099,['NOTNLM'],"['ZC3HAV1', 'host defense', 'retrovirus']",2013/07/10 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1310604110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1310604110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 23;110(30):12379-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310604110.

HRR usually depends on BRCA1/2-RAD51, and RAD52-RAD51 serves as back-up. To target HRR in tumor cells, a phenomenon called ""synthetic lethality"" was applied, which relies on the addiction of cancer cells to a single DNA repair pathway, whereas normal cells operate 2 or more mechanisms. Using mutagenesis and a peptide aptamer approach, we pinpointed phenylalanine 79 in RAD52 DNA binding domain I (RAD52-phenylalanine 79 [F79]) as a valid target to induce synthetic lethality in BRCA1- and/or BRCA2-deficient leukemias and carcinomas without affecting normal cells and tissues. Targeting RAD52-F79 disrupts the RAD52-DNA interaction, resulting in the accumulation of toxic DNA double-stand breaks in malignant cells, but not in normal counterparts. In addition, abrogation of RAD52-DNA interaction enhanced the antileukemia effect of already-approved drugs. BRCA-deficient status predisposing to RAD52-dependent synthetic lethality could be predicted by genetic abnormalities such as oncogenes BCR-ABL1 and PML-RAR, mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes, and gene expression profiles identifying leukemias displaying low levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. We believe this work may initiate a personalized therapeutic approach in numerous patients with tumors displaying encoded and functional BRCA deficiency.","['Cramer-Morales, Kimberly', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Scheibner, Kara', 'Padget, Michelle', 'Irvine, David A', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Haas, Kimberly', 'Lee, Jaewoong', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Roy, Darshan', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Rassool, Feyruz V', 'Wasik, Mariusz A', 'Childers, Wayne', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Civin, Curt I', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Cramer-Morales K', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Scheibner K', 'Padget M', 'Irvine DA', 'Sliwinski T', 'Haas K', 'Lee J', 'Geng H', 'Roy D', 'Slupianek A', 'Rassool FV', 'Wasik MA', 'Childers W', 'Copland M', 'Muschen M', 'Civin CI', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aptamers, Peptide)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Aptamers, Peptide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'BRCA2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peptide Fragments', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3744994,,,2013/07/10 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)54284-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-05-501072 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 15;122(7):1293-304. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-05-501072.

Here we report that SCL levels are limiting for the clonal expansion of Kit(+) multipotent and erythroid progenitors. In addition, increased SCL expression specifically enhances the sensitivity of these progenitors to steel factor (KIT ligand) without affecting interleukin-3 response, whereas a DNA-binding mutant antagonizes KIT function and induces apoptosis in progenitors. Furthermore, a twofold increase in SCL levels in mice bearing a hypomorphic Kit allele (W41/41) corrects their hematocrits and deficiencies in erythroid progenitor numbers. At the molecular level, we found that SCL and c-Kit signaling control a common gene expression signature, of which 19 genes are associated with apoptosis. Half of those were decreased in purified megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs) from W41/41 mice and rescued by the SCL transgene. We conclude that Scl operates downstream of Kit to support the survival of MEPs. Finally, higher SCL expression upregulates Kit in normal bone marrow cells and increases chimerism after bone marrow transplantation, indicating that Scl is also upstream of Kit. We conclude that Scl and Kit establish a positive feedback loop in multipotent and MEPs.","['Lacombe, Julie', 'Krosl, Gorazd', 'Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Gerby, Bastien', 'Martin, Richard', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Lacombe J', 'Krosl G', 'Tremblay M', 'Gerby B', 'Martin R', 'Aplan PD', 'Lemieux S', 'Hoang T']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",PMC3952531,,,2013/07/10 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)54270-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-331819 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 15;122(7):1150-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-331819.

Here, we report for the first time that miRNA-20 and miRNA-106a are preferentially expressed in mouse SSCs. Functional assays in vitro and in vivo using miRNA mimics and inhibitors reveal that miRNA-20 and miRNA-106a are essential for renewal of SSCs. We further demonstrate that these two miRNAs promote renewal at the post-transcriptional level via targeting STAT3 and Ccnd1 and that knockdown of STAT3, Fos, and Ccnd1 results in renewal of SSCs.

We sought to examine whether these loci are susceptibility genes among Hispanics, whose reported incidence of childhood ALL is the highest of all ethnic groups in California, and whether their effects differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). We genotyped 13 variants in these genes among 706 Hispanic (300 cases, 406 controls) and 594 NHW (225 cases, 369 controls) participants in a matched population-based case-control study in California. We found significant associations for the five studied ARID5B variants in both Hispanics (p values of 1.0 x 10(-9) to 0.004) and NHWs (p values of 2.2 x 10(-6) to 0.018). Risk estimates were in the same direction in both groups (ORs of 1.53-1.99 and 1.37-1.84, respectively) and strengthened when restricted to B-cell precursor high-hyperdiploid ALL (>50 chromosomes; ORs of 2.21-3.22 and 1.67-2.71, respectively). Similar results were observed for the single CEBPE variant. Hispanics and NHWs exhibited different susceptibility loci at CDKN2A. Although IKZF1 loci showed significant susceptibility effects among NHWs (p < 1 x 10(-5)), their effects among Hispanics were in the same direction but nonsignificant, despite similar minor allele frequencies.

METHODS: We compared cancer incidence in children in Pennsylvania counties before and after HF drilling began, using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The total number of cancers observed was close to expected both before drilling began (SIR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.99) and after drilling (SIR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.07) for counties with oil and natural gas wells. Analyses for childhood leukemia were also unremarkable (SIR for leukemia before drilling = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.06]; SIR for leukemia after drilling = 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.11]). A slightly elevated SIR was found for central nervous system tumors after drilling (SIR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25). This was because of a slight excess in those counties with the fewest number of wells.

Typical therapy involves high-dose glucocorticosteroids combined with cyclophosphamide in a dose 1-2 mg/kg/per day. A high relapse rate in pulmonary vasculitis means prolonged courses of cyclophosphamide in some patients. Carcinogenic effects of cyclophosphamide, especially its toxic metabolite acrolein that is excreted into the urine, are responsible for the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and bladder cancer. These and other malignancies are cyclophosphamide dose-depended. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of cancer in patients with pulmonary vasculitis in comparison with the incidence of cancer in the general population. Analyses were done according to the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide, subdivided into low (</=35 g) and high (>35 g). During the observation period 15 cancers occurred. A significantly increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was observed for non-melanoma skin cancers (SIR 5.2; 95 % Cl 2.3-8.7), AML (SIR 4.3; 95 % Cl 2.1-11.2), and bladder cancer (SIR 3.4; 95 % Cl 1.6-5.2). Induction remission treatment and relapse treatment with cyclophosphamide involves a substantial risk of late appearing malignances in patients with pulmonary vasculitis. Monitoring and prophylactic management in pulmonary vasculitis after cessation of cyclophosphamide therapy is crucial.","['Zycinska, Katarzyna', 'Kostrzewa-Janicka, Jolanta', 'Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta', 'Wardyn, Kazimierz']","['Zycinska K', 'Kostrzewa-Janicka J', 'Nitsch-Osuch A', 'Wardyn K']","['Department of Family Medicine, Internal and Metabolic Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw and Systemic Vasculitis Outpatient Clinic, Czerniakowski Hospital, Warsaw, Poland, kzycinska@poczta.fm.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinogens', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lung Diseases/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Vasculitis/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/10 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-007-6627-3_47 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;788:349-53. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-6627-3_47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a standard treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia. This study aimed to explore the effect of therapeutic exposure to arsenic on lung function. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This was a case-control cross-sectional study on patients with haematological malignancies with or without exposure to ATO. Full lung function tests and serum Clara cell protein 16 (CC16) were measured. RESULTS: There were 57 cases (arsenic exposed) and 57 matched controls (arsenic non-exposed) recruited. Among cases, the median duration of ATO exposure was 519 (194-1259) days. The mean FEV(1)/FVC ratio, FEV(1) (% predicted), and RV/TLC (%), as well as % subjects with FEV(1)/FVC below lower limits of normal (LLN), were similar in the two groups with or without arsenic exposure. However the mean TLC (% predicted) and DLCO/VA were significantly higher in arsenic-exposed versus non-exposed group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008 respectively). There were mildly reduced FEV(1)/FVC ratio and FEF(25-75) (% predicted), largely within normal limits, among high level arsenic exposure compared with non-exposure (p = 0.01 and p = 0.05 respectively). Serum CC16 was comparable among both arsenic exposed and non-exposed groups. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic use of oral ATO for a median of around 1.5 years was not associated with clinically significant lung function impairment.","['Ho, James Chung-Man', 'Au, Wing-Yan', 'Han, Li', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Ip, Mary Sau-Man']","['Ho JC', 'Au WY', 'Han L', 'Kwong YL', 'Ip MS']","['Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. jhocm@hku.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130705,England,Respir Med,Respiratory medicine,8908438,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (SCGB1A1 protein, human)', '9060-09-7 (Uteroglobin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lung Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*adverse effects', 'Uteroglobin/metabolism', 'Vital Capacity/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATO', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'CC16', 'Clara cell protein', 'Clara cell protein 16', 'DLCO', 'DLCO/VA', 'FEF(25-75)', 'FEV(1)', 'FVC', 'IQR', 'Leukaemia', 'Lung function', 'RV', 'SD', 'TLC', 'acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'diffusing capacity corrected for haemoglobin', 'forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC', 'forced expiratory volume in one second', 'forced vital capacity', 'interquartile range', 'residual volume', 'standard deviation', 'total lung capacity', 'transfer factor']",2013/07/10 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0954-6111(13)00224-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rmed.2013.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Respir Med. 2013 Sep;107(9):1423-30. doi: 10.1016/j.rmed.2013.06.012.

While cyclic [KW]5-AuNPs formed sponge-like agglomerates, linear (KW)5-AuNPs demonstrated ball-shaped structures. A comparative flow cytometry study showed that the cellular uptake of fluorescence-labeled anti-HIV drugs (emtricitabine (FTC) and lamivudine (3TC)) in human leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells, and a negatively charged cell-impermeable phosphopeptide (GpYEEI) in human ovarian adecarcinoma (SK-OV-3) cells was significantly higher in the presence of cyclic [KW]5-AuNPs than that of linear (KW)5-AuNPs, parent cyclic [KW]5, and linear (KW)5 peptides. For example, the cellular uptake of F'-GpYEEI was enhanced 12.8-fold by c[KW]5-AuNPs.

This miR has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including chemoresistance, possibly by directly modulating the expression of several apoptotic related proteins. It was recently shown to directly target Bcl-2 mRNA and upregulate Bcl-2 protein expression. Nevertheless, the possible effect of miR-21 in autophagy has never been addressed. This study investigates the effects of targeting miR-21 with antimiRs on chronic myeloid leukemia cellular autophagy and on associated drug sensitivity. We observed that miR-21 downregulation decreased cellular viability and proliferation, although no changes to the normal cell cycle profile were observed. miR-21 downregulation also caused increased programmed cell death and a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein, although PARP cleavage was not affected, indicating that apoptosis was not the relevant mechanism underlying the observed results. Treatment with antimiR-21 caused an increase in the autophagy related proteins Beclin-1, Vps34 and LC3-II. Accordingly, autophagic vacuoles were visualized both by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and acridine orange (AO) staining and also by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, miR-21 downregulation increased K562 and KYO-1 cellular sensitivity to etoposide or doxorubicin. This chemosensitivity was reverted by pre-treating cells with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Finally, serum starvation (an autophagy inducer) also increased sensitivity to these drugs, confirming that autophagy sensitized these cells to the effect of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of autophagy induction via miR-21 targeting and its involvement in drug sensitivity.","['Seca, Hugo', 'Lima, Raquel T', 'Lopes-Rodrigues, Vanessa', 'Guimaraes, Jose E', 'Almeida, G M', 'Vasconcelos, M Helena']","['Seca H', 'Lima RT', 'Lopes-Rodrigues V', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Almeida GM', 'Vasconcelos MH']","['Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP - Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/10 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['CDT-EPUB-01-53707 [pii]', '10.2174/13894501113149990185 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2013 Sep;14(10):1135-43. doi: 10.2174/13894501113149990185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, MERTK is overexpressed or ectopically expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, pituitary adenomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas, potentially resulting in the activation of several canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. These include the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, as well as regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription family members, migration-associated proteins including the focal adhesion kinase and myosin light chain 2, and prosurvival proteins such as survivin and Bcl-2. Each has been implicated in MERTK physiologic and oncogenic functions. In neoplastic cells, these signaling events result in functional phenotypes such as decreased apoptosis, increased migration, chemoresistance, increased colony formation, and increased tumor formation in murine models. Conversely, MERTK inhibition by genetic or pharmacologic means can reverse these pro-oncogenic phenotypes. Multiple therapeutic approaches to MERTK inhibition are currently in development, including ligand ""traps"", a monoclonal antibody, and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Cummings, Christopher T', 'Deryckere, Deborah', 'Earp, H Shelton', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Cummings CT', 'Deryckere D', 'Earp HS', 'Graham DK']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado; and Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20130705,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MERTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase']",,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-1451 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1451 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 1;19(19):5275-80. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1451.

PTKs induce activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which can result in prevention of apoptosis. Here, we describe an important role of the TrkC-associated molecular network in the process of leukemogenesis. TrkC was found to be frequently overexpressed in human leukemia cells and leukemia subtypes. In U937 human leukemia cells, blockade of TrkC using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific to TrkC or K562a, a specific inhibitor of TrkC, resulted in a significant decrease in growth and survival of the cells, which was closely associated with reduced mTOR level and Akt activity. In addition, TrkC enhances the survival and proliferation of leukemia, which is correlated with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, TrkC significantly inhibits apoptosis via induction of the expression of PLK-1 and Twist-1 through activation of AKT/mTor pathway; therefore, it plays a key role in leukemogenesis. These findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for TrkC in the pathogenesis of leukemia and have important implications for understanding various hematological malignancies.","['Kim, Min Soo', 'Kim, Gyoung Mi', 'Choi, Yun-Jeong', 'Kim, Hye Joung', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Jin, Wook']","['Kim MS', 'Kim GM', 'Choi YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YJ', 'Jin W']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 406-840, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkC)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkC/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3887946,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/03/15 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10059-013-0061-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2013 Aug;36(2):177-84. doi: 10.1007/s10059-013-0061-6.

We compared neuropsychological outcomes for patients treated on DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01, which included a randomized comparison of the two steroid preparations during post-induction therapy in children and adolescents with ALL. PROCEDURE: Between 2000 and 2005, 408 children with standard-risk or high-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 00-01 were randomly assigned to prednisone or dexamethasone administered as 5-day pulses every 3 weeks for 2 years, beginning at week 7 of treatment. Blinded neuropsychological testing was completed for 170 randomized patients (prednisone, N = 76; dexamethasone, N = 94), all of whom were in continuous complete remission after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Outcomes were comparable for most variables, although patients on the dexamethasone arm performed more poorly on a measure of fluid reasoning (P = 0.02). They also tended to be more likely to be enrolled in special education (dexamethasone, 33% vs. prednisone, 20%, P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone has well documented benefit in treatment of ALL. Although formal testing provided little indication of increased risk for neurotoxicity relative to prednisone, the somewhat greater utilization of special education services by patients treated with dexamethasone merits further investigation.","['Waber, Deborah P', 'McCabe, Marie', 'Sebree, Mikaela', 'Forbes, Peter W', 'Adams, Heather', 'Alyman, Cheryl', 'Sands, Stephen A', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Romero, Ivonne', 'Routhier, Marie-Eve', 'Girard, Jonathan M', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Waber DP', 'McCabe M', 'Sebree M', 'Forbes PW', 'Adams H', 'Alyman C', 'Sands SA', 'Robaey P', 'Romero I', 'Routhier ME', 'Girard JM', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","[""Division of Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130706,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*adverse effects']",PMC5384642,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'behavior', 'children', 'cognition', 'dexamethasone']",2013/07/09 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24666 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Nov;60(11):1785-91. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24666.

So far, its oncogenic role has been controversially discussed because both overexpression and inactivating mutations are found. A recent study on primary samples from patients with acute T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) revealed that most of them do not express WT1 proteins although they express WT1 mRNA. In our study, we investigated WT-1 expression in ten T-ALL cell lines established from leukemia/lymphoma patients. We show that consistent with the finding in primary T-ALL cells, most of the leukemic T-cell lines tested do not overexpress WT1 proteins. We found that leukemic T-cells overexpressing WT1 protein produce higher levels of CD95L and show elevated CD95L-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) compared to cells lacking or expressing low levels of WT1. Ectopic expression of WT1 in the WT1-nonexpressing leukemic T-cell line increases CD95L expression and elevates activation-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing WT1 expression in the WT1-overexpressing leukemic T-cell line by siRNA confers reduced CD95L expression and reduction in AICD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase-promoter reporter analysis demonstrate that WT1 binds to and enhances CD95L promoter activity through the Egr-binding sites. Our study provides a new role of WT1 in regulation of CD95L-mediated cell death.","['Bourkoula, Konstantina', 'Englert, Christoph', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Kohler, Rebecca', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Bourkoula K', 'Englert C', 'Giaisi M', 'Kohler R', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130809,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD95 ligand', 'WT1', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'transcriptional regulation']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28379 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Jan 15;134(2):291-300. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28379.

Owing to their potential as drug targets in cancer therapy, several inhibitors of BCL-2 family proteins have been developed. These primarily target specific members of the BCL-2 family, particularly BCL-2 and BCL-XL but are ineffective against MCL-1. Major efforts have been invested in developing inhibitors of MCL-1, which is commonly amplified in human tumours and associated with tumour relapse and chemoresistance. In this report, the specificity of several BCL-2 family inhibitors (ABT-263, UCB-1350883, apogossypol and BH3I-1) was investigated and compared with putative MCL-1 inhibitors designed to exhibit improved or selective binding affinities for MCL-1 (TW-37, BI97C1, BI97C10, BI112D1, compounds 6 and 7, and MCL-1 inhibitor molecule (MIM-1)). ABT-263, BI97C1, BI112D1, MIM-1 and TW-37 exhibited specificity in inducing apoptosis in a Bax/Bak- and caspase-9-dependent manner, whereas the other agents showed no killing activity, or little or no specificity. Of these inhibitors, only ABT-263 and UCB-1350883 induced apoptosis in a BCL-2- or BCL-XL-dependent system. In cells that depend on MCL-1 for survival, ABT-263 and TW-37 induced extensive apoptosis, suggesting that at high concentrations these inhibitors have the propensity to inhibit MCL-1 in a cellular context. TW-37 induced apoptosis, assessed by chromatin condensation, caspase processing and phosphatidylserine externalisation, in a BAK-dependent manner and in cells that require MCL-1 for survival. TW-37-mediated apoptosis was also partly dependent on NOXA, suggesting that derivatives of TW-37, if engineered to exhibit better selectivity and efficacy at low nanomolar concentrations, may provide useful lead compounds for further synthetic programmes. Expanded medicinal chemistry iteration, as performed for the ABT series, may likewise improve the potency and specificity of the evaluated MCL-1 inhibitors.","['Varadarajan, S', 'Vogler, M', 'Butterworth, M', 'Dinsdale, D', 'Walensky, L D', 'Cohen, G M']","['Varadarajan S', 'Vogler M', 'Butterworth M', 'Dinsdale D', 'Walensky LD', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130705,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TW-37 compound)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3792441,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201379 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.79 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Nov;20(11):1475-84. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.79.

Closely positioned somatic SETBP1 mutations encoding changes in Asp868, Ser869, Gly870, Ile871 and Asp880, which match germline mutations in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), were detected in 17% of secondary acute myeloid leukemias (sAML) and 15% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. Mutant cases were associated with advanced age and monosomy 7/deletion 7q (-7/del(7q)) constituting poor prognostic factors. Analysis of serially collected samples indicated that SETBP1 mutations were acquired during leukemic evolution. Transduction with mutant Setbp1 led to the immortalization of mouse myeloid progenitors that showed enhanced proliferative capacity compared to cells transduced with wild-type Setbp1. Somatic mutations of SETBP1 seem to cause gain of function, are associated with myeloid leukemic transformation and convey poor prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and CMML.","['Makishima, Hideki', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Nguyen, Nhu', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Ng, Kwok Peng', 'Gudmundsson, Kristbjorn O', 'Vishwakarma, Bandana A', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Gomez-Segui, Ines', 'Takahashi, Mariko', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Guinta, Kathryn', 'Mori, Hiraku', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Paquette, Ronald L', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Du, Yang', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Makishima H', 'Yoshida K', 'Nguyen N', 'Przychodzen B', 'Sanada M', 'Okuno Y', 'Ng KP', 'Gudmundsson KO', 'Vishwakarma BA', 'Jerez A', 'Gomez-Segui I', 'Takahashi M', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Nagata Y', 'Guinta K', 'Mori H', 'Sekeres MA', 'Chiba K', 'Tanaka H', 'Muramatsu H', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Paquette RL', 'McDevitt MA', 'Kojima S', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Miyano S', 'Shih LY', 'Du Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130707,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Exome', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/mortality', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3729750,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ng.2696 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.2696 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2013 Aug;45(8):942-6. doi: 10.1038/ng.2696.

Molecular screening at diagnosis identified CALM-AF10 in 30/431 (7%) patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 16 years and over and in 15/234 (6%) of those aged up to 15 years. Adult CALM-AF10-positive patients were predominantly (72%) negative for surface (s)CD3/T-cell receptor, whereas children were predominantly (67%) positive for T-cell receptor. Among 22 adult CALM-AF10-positive patients treated according to the LALA94/GRAALL03-05 protocols, the poor prognosis for event-free survival (P=0.0017) and overall survival (P=0.0014) was restricted to the 15 T-cell receptor-negative cases. Among CALM-AF10-positive, T-cell receptor-negative patients, 82% had an early T-cell precursor phenotype, reported to be of poor prognosis in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia corresponded to 22% of adult LALA94/GRAALL03-05 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, but had no prognostic impact per se. CALM-AF10 fusion within early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (21%) did, however, identify a group with a poor prognosis with regards to event-free survival (P=0.04). CALM-AF10 therefore identifies a poor prognostic group within sCD3/T-cell receptor negative adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and is over-represented within early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, in which it identifies patients in whom treatment is likely to fail.

We have analyzed the outcome of 136 patients who underwent dUCBT reported to the SFGM-TC registry between 2005 and 2007. Forty-six patients received myeloablative regimens, and 90 patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. There were 84 cases of leukemia, 17 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 11 cases of myeloma, and 24 other hematologic malignancies. At transplantation, 40 (29%) patients were in complete remission. At day 60 after transplantation, the cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 91%. We observed one UCB unit domination in 88% of cases.

The identity of the LIC is highly diverse and ranges from populations resembling hematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors (MPPs) to more committed myeloid progenitors, and the question still remains whether this is a direct consequence of which cells are targets of the final transforming events. In this study, we use premalignant cells from a Cebpa mutant AML model, in which the LIC population resembles granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), to show that premalignant GMPs undergo spontaneous immortalization with a high clonal frequency when cultured in vitro, suggesting that these cells constitute the target of the final transforming events. Furthermore, we show that premalignant GMPs are characterized by a distinct T cell gene expression signature correlating with an increased potential for differentiation toward the T cell lineage. These findings have implications for our understanding of the transcriptional wiring in premalignant myeloid progenitors and how this contributes to the development of AML.","['Schuster, Mikkel B', 'Frank, Anne-Katrine', 'Bagger, Frederik O', 'Rapin, Nicolas', 'Vikesaa, Jonas', 'Porse, Bo T']","['Schuster MB', 'Frank AK', 'Bagger FO', 'Rapin N', 'Vikesaa J', 'Porse BT']","['The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Biotech Research and Innovation Center, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Danish Stem Cell Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130702,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors']",,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00558-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Oct;41(10):882-893.e16. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.06.003.

The chimeric transcription factor AML1-EVI-1 is activated in leukaemia where it plays a role as a differentiation block and stimulator of proliferation. Here, we cloned chicken Evi-1 and analysed its expression during embryonic development. There was early expression in the pharyngeal arches, in the brain and intermediate mesoderm of chicken embryos at stage 15. Later at stage 20, Evi-1 mesenchymal expression was concentrated in the second pharyngeal arch, and weaker expression was found in the mandibular and maxillary prominences. Facial expression decreased in intensity during development. Evi-1 expression in the limb was also limited to the mesenchyme with the most prominent expression in the anterior margin. Evi-1 was not detectable in the posterior limb bud. At later stages, Evi-1 was expressed in the peripheral mesenchyme of the limb but not in the developing precartilage blastema. At stage 29, the expression became restricted to the perichondrium and interdigital areas; however, the cartilage condensations themselves were negative. To study the function of Evi-1 in chondrogenesis, we knocked down expression in limb micromass cultures using siRNA. Chondrogenesis was significantly reduced in both anterior and posterior cultures. Since Evi-1 was expressed adjacent to the apical ectodermal ridge and this area is a source of FGFs, we tested whether endogenous FGF receptor signalling was necessary to maintain its expression. Inhibitors of FGFRs (PD161570 and SU5402) were applied to wing mesenchyme, and downregulation of Evi-1 expression was observed after treatment with both inhibitors. Therefore, Evi-1 may be a transcription factor mediating the effects of FGF and may also be defining the size of cartilage elements in the limb.","['Cela, P', 'Balkova, S Moravcova', 'Bryjova, A', 'Horakova, D', 'Misek, I', 'Richman, J M', 'Buchtova, M']","['Cela P', 'Balkova SM', 'Bryjova A', 'Horakova D', 'Misek I', 'Richman JM', 'Buchtova M']","['Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,Netherlands,Gene Expr Patterns,Gene expression patterns : GEP,101167473,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Body Patterning', 'Cartilage/embryology/metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Head/embryology', 'Limb Buds/embryology/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anterior-posterior axes', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Craniofacial', 'Ecotropical viral integration site 1', 'Limb patterning', 'Pharyngeal arch', 'siRNA']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/06/13 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-133X(13)00072-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gep.2013.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Expr Patterns. 2013 Dec;13(8):343-53. doi: 10.1016/j.gep.2013.06.002.

One-third of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are associated with aberrant localization of NPM1 to the cytoplasm (NPM1c+). This mutation is critical during leukemogenesis and constitutes a good prognostic factor for chemotherapy. At present, there is no clear molecular basis for the role of NPM1 in DNA repair and the tumorigenic process. We found that the nuclear apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), a core enzyme in base excision DNA repair (BER) of DNA lesions, specifically interacts with NPM1 within nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. Cytoplasmic accumulation of APE1 is associated with cancers including, as we show, NPM1c+ AML. Here we show that NPM1 stimulates APE1 BER activity in cells. We provide evidence that expression of the NPM1c+ variant causes cytoplasmic accumulation of APE1 in: (i) a heterologous cell system (HeLa cells); (ii) the myeloid cell line OCI/AML3 stably expressing NPM1c+; and (iii) primary lymphoblasts of NPM1c+ AML patients. Consistent with impaired APE1 localization, OCI/AML3 cells and blasts of AML patients have impaired BER activity. Cytoplasmic APE1 in NPM1c+ myeloid cells is truncated due to proteolysis. Thus, the good prognostic response of NPM1c+ AML to chemotherapy may result from the cytoplasmic relocalization of APE1 and the consequent BER deficiency. NPM1 thus has an indirect but significant role in BER in vivo that may also be important for NPM1c+ tumorigenesis.","['Vascotto, C', 'Lirussi, L', 'Poletto, M', 'Tiribelli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Fabbro, D', 'Damante, G', 'Demple, B', 'Colombo, E', 'Tell, G']","['Vascotto C', 'Lirussi L', 'Poletto M', 'Tiribelli M', 'Damiani D', 'Fabbro D', 'Damante G', 'Demple B', 'Colombo E', 'Tell G']","['Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medical Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medical Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Stony Brook University School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport']",,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013251 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 May 29;33(22):2876-87. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.251.

However, refinements of xenotransplantation assays, alternative methods of quantitation and syngeneic murine models have all led to an appreciation that LSCs display marked variability in frequency, immunophenotype and differentiation potential, both between and even within leukemias. Insights from next-generation sequencing efforts have dramatically extended understanding of the mutational landscape and clonal organization of AML and have added an additional layer of complexity to the biology of LSCs: a requirement to consider the effect of the various recurrently occurring genetic lesions in AML on the initiation and maintenance of leukemic subclones. Despite these advances, cure rates in AML remain substantially unchanged in recent years. A renewed focus on the biological properties of chemotherapy-resistant LSCs, a cellular entity of prime clinical importance, will be required to develop additional therapeutic strategies to enhance patient outcomes.","['Wiseman, D H', 'Greystoke, B F', 'Somervaille, T C P']","['Wiseman DH', 'Greystoke BF', 'Somervaille TC']","['Cancer Research UK Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130708,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/08/08 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013269 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.269 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Jun 12;33(24):3091-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.269.

Although EWS/FLI-1 chimeric proteins are necessary for carcinogenesis, additional events seem to be required for transformation to occur. We have previously reported that a protein product of an EWS mRNA target, whose expression is negatively regulated by EWS but not by EWS/FLI-1, contributes to ESFT development. However, the mechanism by which EWS represses protein expression remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that overexpression of full-length EWS repressed protein expression and induced nuclear retention of reporter mRNAs in a tethering assay. In contrast, when a mutant lacking the EWS C-terminal nuclear localization signal (classified as a PY-NLS) was expressed, reporter protein expression was upregulated, and the number of cells exporting reporter mRNA to the cytoplasm increased. EWS binds to the 3'-untranslated region in another mRNA target, cofilin 1 (CFL1), and negatively regulates the expression of CFL1. Overexpression of EWS induced nuclear retention of CFL1 mRNA. Furthermore, ESFT cell proliferation and metastatic potential were suppressed by small interfering RNA-mediated CFL1 knockdown. Together, our findings suggest that EWS induces nuclear retention of CFL1 mRNA, thereby suppressing expression of CFL1, and that CFL1 promotes development of ESFT.

Independent of these capabilities, LIF was also identified to be responsible for cancer development and progression. However, its detailed cellular function in cancer remains unclear thus far. We found LIF to be expressed in melanoma cell lines of primary and metastatic origin and in melanoma tissue. We further elucidated stimuli that are responsible for the high expression levels of LIF. Interestingly, hypoxia, specifically through HIF-1alpha, is involved in regulating LIF. Furthermore, our data showed that the signaling of LIF was not mediated by the classically described pathway via STAT3, but rather through BMP4 and BMP7. We hypothesize that the co-expression of LIF and BMP is necessary for a de-differentiated cancer phenotype. Ancillary to BMP4 and BMP7, classical stem cell proteins, e.g., SOX2, NANOG, OCT3/4 and GBX2, are regulated by LIF. We therefore speculate that LIF can induce a typical ""cancer stem cell""-like behavior, as the appropriate genes are regulated by LIF. Particularly, the expression of these genes has been proposed as a driving force for tumorigenesis and the initiation of metastasis. Notably, LIF has an important role not only for ES cells but also for cancer development. Melanoblast-related cells (MBrcs), which resemble the neural crest precursor cells of melanocytes, expressed LIF in minor amounts compared to normal human melanocytes. These data, along with the data that LIF is upregulated in melanoma cell lines compared to melanocytes, strongly indicate that LIF is important for the stabilization of the melanoma phenotype. To elucidate the role of LIF in cellular melanoma behavior, we analyzed proliferation, attachment, migration and colony formation after silencing LIF by siRNA, and found all four characteristics restricted. In summary, we can show that LIF is an important factor in melanoma progression.","['Kuphal, Silke', 'Wallner, Susanne', 'Bosserhoff, Anja K']","['Kuphal S', 'Wallner S', 'Bosserhoff AK']","['Institute of Pathology, Molecular Pathology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.

Maximal sympathetic axon regeneration in vitro requires phosphorylation of both S727 and Y705. Furthermore, cytokine signaling is necessary for NGF-induced sympathetic nerve sprouting in the heart after MI. Transfection studies in neurons lacking STAT3 suggest two independent pools of STAT3, phosphorylated on either S727 or Y705, that regulate sympathetic regeneration via both transcriptional and non-transcriptional means. Additional data identify STAT3-microtubule interactions that may complement the well-characterized role of STAT3 stimulating regeneration associated genes.

The gp85 gene from ALV-J was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein was injected intramuscularly into the breeder hens along with CpG-ODN or Freund's adjuvants, and the antibodies in the serum were assayed regularly post inoculation. The fertilized eggs from the vaccinated hens were hatched, the hatched chickens were challenged with 10(2.2) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) ALV-J on 1 day, and the maternal antibodies in the hatched chickens were examined regularly before and after the challenge.

The results suggest that the gp85 recombinant protein was successfully prepared and was inoculated with CpG-ODN adjuvant into breeder hens to induce serological antibody against ALV-J in the hens and in the hatched chickens. The positive maternal antibodies in the hatched chickens provided effective protection for most chickens against viremia and dramatically decreased the number of immunosuppressive lesions; these protective effects were better than those of the gp85 recombinant protein plus Freund's adjuvant.

We have shown that CDKN2A expression is associated with short-term survival in newly diagnosed MM patients (survival was 30.3 +/- 3.9 months for 'low' expressed and 7.5 +/- 5.6 months for 'high' expressed group, p<0.0001). Moreover low-expression CDKN2A group showed time-to-progression benefit in newly diagnosed patients (remission was 20.8 +/- 3.6 months for 'low' and 8.4 +/- 2.7 months for 'high' expressed group, p<0.0001) as well as in whole studied cohort of MM patients (remission was 20.8 +/- 2.8 months for 'low' and 9.8 +/- 1.1 months for 'high' expressed group, p<0.0001). The overexpression of inhibitors can be explained as a compensatory reaction to growing ""oncogenic stress"".","['Kryukov, Fedor', 'Dementyeva, Elena', 'Kubiczkova, Lenka', 'Jarkovsky, Jiri', 'Brozova, Lucie', 'Petrik, Jakub', 'Nemec, Pavel', 'Sevcikova, Sabina', 'Minarik, Jiri', 'Stefanikova, Zdena', 'Kuglik, Petr', 'Hajek, Roman']","['Kryukov F', 'Dementyeva E', 'Kubiczkova L', 'Jarkovsky J', 'Brozova L', 'Petrik J', 'Nemec P', 'Sevcikova S', 'Minarik J', 'Stefanikova Z', 'Kuglik P', 'Hajek R']","['Babak Myeloma Group, Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.

It is associated with decreased milk production and increased cull rates due to development of lymphosarcoma. The virus also affects the immune system. Infected cows display a weak response to some vaccinations. It is important to determine if the heritability of BL susceptibility is greater than zero, or if the environment is the only factor that can be used to reduce the transmission and incidence of the disease. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritability for BL incidence and the genetic merit of sires for leukosis resistance in Holstein and Jersey cattle. Continuous scores and binary milk ELISA results for 13,217 Holstein cows from 114 dairy herds across 16 states and 642 Jersey cows from 8 dairy herds were considered. Data were obtained from commercial testing records at Antel BioSystems (Lansing, MI). Out of the 13,859 animals tested, 38% were found to be infected with the disease. Linear and threshold animal models were used to analyze the continuous and binary data, respectively. Results from both models were similar in terms of estimated breeding values and variance components in their respective scales. Estimates of heritability obtained with the 2 approaches were approximately 8% for both breeds, indicating a considerable genetic component underlying BL disease incidence. The correlation between the estimated breeding values from the 2 models was larger than 0.90, and the lists of top 10% bulls selected from each model had about 80% overlap for both breeds. In summary, results indicate that a simple linear model using the continuous ELISA scores as the response variable was a reasonable approach for the genetic analysis of BL incidence in cattle. In addition, the levels of heritability found indicate that genetic selection could also be used to decrease susceptibility to bovine leukosis virus infection in Holstein and Jersey cattle. Further research is necessary to investigate the genetic correlations of BL with other production and reproduction traits, and to search for potential genomic regions harboring major genes affecting BL susceptibility.","['Abdalla, E A', 'Rosa, G J M', 'Weigel, K A', 'Byrem, T']","['Abdalla EA', 'Rosa GJ', 'Weigel KA', 'Byrem T']","['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA. eabdalla@wisc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130705,United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Breeding', 'Cattle/genetics', 'Dairying/statistics & numerical data', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/genetics', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Male', 'Milk/chemistry', 'Pedigree', 'Quantitative Trait, Heritable', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukosis', 'heritability', 'milk ELISA', 'threshold model']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-0302(13)00486-4 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.2013-6732 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2013 Sep;96(9):6022-9. doi: 10.3168/jds.2013-6732.

However, the molecular details of how these complexes form are poorly understood. One such complex, which contains the basic-helix-loop-helix heterodimer SCL:E47 and bridging proteins LMO2:LDB1, critically regulates hematopoiesis and induces T cell leukemia. Here, we report the crystal structure of (SCL:E47)bHLH:LMO2:LDB1LID bound to DNA, providing a molecular account of the network of interactions assembling this complex. This reveals an unexpected role for LMO2. Upon binding to SCL, LMO2 induces new hydrogen bonds in SCL:E47, thereby strengthening heterodimer formation. This imposes a rotation movement onto E47 that weakens the heterodimer:DNA interaction, shifting the main DNA-binding activity onto additional protein partners. Along with biochemical analyses, this illustrates, at an atomic level, how hematopoietic-specific SCL sequesters ubiquitous E47 and associated cofactors and supports SCL's reported DNA-binding-independent functions. Importantly, this work will drive the design of small molecules inhibiting leukemogenic processes.","['El Omari, Kamel', 'Hoosdally, Sarah J', 'Tuladhar, Kapil', 'Karia, Dimple', 'Hall-Ponsele, Elisa', 'Platonova, Olga', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Patient, Roger', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'Mancini, Erika J']","['El Omari K', 'Hoosdally SJ', 'Tuladhar K', 'Karia D', 'Hall-Ponsele E', 'Platonova O', 'Vyas P', 'Patient R', 'Porcher C', 'Mancini EJ']","['Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Multimerization', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3714592,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00286-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 Jul 11;4(1):135-47. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.06.008.

To understand this disease, physicians have been studying risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, aging, obesity, and joint malalignment; however have been unable to conclusively determine the direct etiology. Current treatment options are short-term or ineffective and fail to address pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms involved with cartilage degeneration and the induction of pain in arthritic joints. OA pain involves a complex integration of sensory, affective, and cognitive processes that integrate a variety of abnormal cellular mechanisms at both peripheral and central (spinal and supraspinal) levels of the nervous system Through studies examined by investigators, the role of growth factors and cytokines has increasingly become more relevant in examining their effects on articular cartilage homeostasis and the development of osteoarthritis and osteoarthritis-associated pain. Catabolic factors involved in both cartilage degradation in vitro and nociceptive stimulation include IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2, FGF-2 and PKCdelta, and pharmacologic inhibitors to these mediators, as well as compounds such as RSV and LfcinB, may potentially be used as biological treatments in the future.

As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are vital steps during cancer progression and metastatic colonization, the ability of cancer cells to resist anoikis has now attracted main attention from the scientific community. Cancer cells develop anoikis resistance due to several mechanisms, including change in integrins' repertoire allowing them to grow in different niches, activation of a plethora of inside-out pro-survival signals as over-activation of receptors due to sustained autocrine loops, oncogene activation, growth factor receptor overexpression, or mutation/upregulation of key enzymes involved in integrin or growth factor receptor signaling. In addition, tumor microenvironment has also been acknowledged to contribute to anoikis resistance of bystander cancer cells, by modulating matrix stiffness, enhancing oxidative stress, producing pro-survival soluble factors, triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition and self-renewal ability, as well as leading to metabolic deregulations of cancer cells. All these events help cancer cells to inhibit the apoptosis machinery and sustain pro-survival signals after detachment, counteracting anoikis and constituting promising targets for anti-metastatic pharmacological therapy.

When tested in a human tumor cell panel, the prodrug exhibited a preference for inhibiting the growth of leukemia and lymphoma cells.

A patient, with chemo- and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, who presented concomitant acute promyelocytic leukemia, showed a response in her breast lesions to retinoic acid, arsenic, and aracytin. We therefore investigated whether RARA gene amplification could be associated with sensitivity to retinoic acid derivatives in breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression arrays were used to characterize RARA amplifications and expression in 103 breast cancer samples. In vitro activity of ATRA was characterized in T47D, SKBR3, and BT474 cell lines. RESULTS: Retinoic acid receptor alpha was gained or amplified in 27% of HER2-positive and 13% of HER2-negative breast cancer samples. Retinoic acid receptor alpha can be coamplified with HER2. Retinoic acid receptor alpha copy number changes could be correlated with messenger RNA expression. All-trans-retinoic acid reduced cell viability of RARA-amplified, but not RARA-normal, cell lines through apoptosis. Gene expression arrays showed that ATRA-induced apoptosis in RARA-amplified cell lines was related to an increase in CASP1 and IRF1. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that breast cancers exhibiting RARA amplifications could be sensitive to retinoic acid. A phase II trial will evaluate this hypothesis in the clinical setting.","['Alsafadi, Samar', 'Even, Caroline', 'Falet, Coralie', 'Goubar, Aicha', 'Commo, Frederic', 'Scott, Veronique', 'Quidville, Virginie', 'Albiges, Laurence', 'Dieci, Maria-Vittoria', 'Guegan, Justine', 'Lazar, Vladimir', 'Ahomadegbe, Jean-Charles', 'Delaloge, Suzette', 'Andre, Fabrice']","['Alsafadi S', 'Even C', 'Falet C', 'Goubar A', 'Commo F', 'Scott V', 'Quidville V', 'Albiges L', 'Dieci MV', 'Guegan J', 'Lazar V', 'Ahomadegbe JC', 'Delaloge S', 'Andre F']","['INSERM U981 ""Identification of molecular predictors and new targets for cancer treatment"", Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,United States,Clin Breast Cancer,Clinical breast cancer,100898731,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Trastuzumab', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['All-trans-retinoic acid', 'Coamplification', 'HER2', 'IRF1', 'RARA']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1526-8209(13)00027-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clbc.2013.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Breast Cancer. 2013 Oct;13(5):401-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clbc.2013.02.001.

Overexpression of these 2 proteins had long been thought to contribute to cancer progression and poor outcomes, thus, therapies targeting HER-2 and VEGFA signaling pathways have been applied in recent years. Herceptin is a HER-2 targeted antibody that being widely used for the management of HER-2 positive breast cancer, which demonstrate significant benefits in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10 months. Identification of subpopulations best suited for and most likely to respond to Herceptin is of utmost importance. We analyzed the signaling pathways of HER-2 and found that HER-2 shares a very similar downstream network with VEGFA, while LGR5 lies in the upstream of VEGFA and could promotes its expression through CTNNB1. This discovery suggests that the LGR5 directed VEGFA overexpression may activate downstream signals of HER-2 despite Herceptin treatment. Here, we hypothesized that in LGR5 overexpressing breast cancer cases, activation of VEGFA-VRGFR bypass may account for the resistance to HER-2 directed therapies. Concurrent inhibition of VEGFR might enhance Herceptin sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of Herceptin-based therapy. Nevertheless, wet lab experiments and clinical trials are still required.","['Chen, Chan', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Xu, Jun-Mei', 'Han, Yong']","['Chen C', 'Zhang C', 'Xu JM', 'Han Y']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Anesthesiology Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LGR5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trastuzumab', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'CTNNB1', 'HER-2', 'IgG1', 'LGR5', 'MAPK', 'P27', 'PI3K', 'PTEN', 'RER', 'VEGFA', 'VEGFR', 'catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27, Kip1)', 'immunoglobulin G 1', 'leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'phosphatase and tensin homolog', 'phosphoinositide-3-kinase', 'rough endoplasmic reticulum', 'v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene', 'v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2', 'vascular endothelial growth factor A', 'vascular endothelial growth factor receptor']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(13)00282-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2013.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2013 Sep;81(3):439-42. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.06.004.

Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), this study investigates the molecular finger-print of nuclear transcription factors during hantavirus infection. The viral-replication-dependent activation of pro-myelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was followed by subsequent localization in nuclear bodies (NBs). PML was also found in close proximity to activated Sp100 nuclear antigen and interferon-stimulated gene 20 kDa protein (ISG-20), but co-localization with death-domain associated protein-6 (DAXX) was not observed. These data demonstrate that hantavirus triggers PML activation and localization in NBs in the absence of DAXX-PLM-NB co-localization.

The modeled structure of modified ligand may, though, be useful for the development of antileukemic agent or it could be act as better inhibitor for hIMPDH-II.","['Bairagya, Hridoy R', 'Mishra, Deepak K', 'Mukhopadhyay, Bishnu P', 'Sekar, K']","['Bairagya HR', 'Mishra DK', 'Mukhopadhyay BP', 'Sekar K']","['a Department of Chemistry , National Institute of Technology , Durgapur , West Bengal , 713209 , India .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130708,England,J Biomol Struct Dyn,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,8404176,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMPDH1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/chemistry', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NAD/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Static Electricity', 'Water/*chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NAD+', 'conserved water molecules', 'hIMPDH-I and II', 'inhibitor', 'isoform-specific', 'modified NAD+', 'recognition']",2013/07/09 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07391102.2013.812982 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2014;32(8):1248-62. doi: 10.1080/07391102.2013.812982.

We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.","['Devitt, Katherine A', 'Lunde, John H', 'Lewis, Michael R']","['Devitt KA', 'Lunde JH', 'Lewis MR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Vermont , Burlington, VT , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130820,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/09 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/09 06:00'],"['2013/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.821703 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 May;55(5):1099-105. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.821703.

Data were collected by means of a face-to-face standardized questionnaire with several items. Mean age was 69 years; 258 patients (58%) were male and 184 (42%) female. Seventy-three patients (16.5%) were found to be CAM users. The most common CAM therapies were green tea, aloe formulations and high dose vitamins. Predictors of CAM use were female gender, younger age, higher education level, internet availability and newspaper reading. The reasons for CAM popularity among these patients are complex.

RhoA, regulating Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming kinase 1 (ROCK1), modulates multiple cell functions, including malignant transformation, metastasis and cell death. Therefore, RhoA/ROCK1 could be an ideal candidate target in cancer treatment. However, the roles of RhoA/ROCK1 axis in apoptosis of leukaemia cells remain elusive. In this study, we explored the effects of RhoA/ROCK1 cascade on selenite-induced apoptosis of leukaemia cells and the underlying mechanism. We found selenite deactivated RhoA/ROCK1 and decreased the association between RhoA and ROCK1 in leukaemia NB4 and Jurkat cells. The inhibited RhoA/ROCK1 signalling enhanced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in a Mek1/2-independent manner. Erk1/2 promoted apoptosis of leukaemia cells after it was activated. Intriguingly, it was shown that both RhoA and ROCK1 were present in the multimolecular complex containing Erk1/2. GST pull-down analysis showed ROCK1 had a direct interaction with GST-Erk2. In addition, selenite-induced apoptosis in an NB4 xenograft model was also found to be associated with the RhoA/ROCK1/Erk1/2 pathway. Our data demonstrate that the RhoA/ROCK1 signalling pathway has important roles in the determination of cell fates and the modulation of Erk1/2 activity at the Mek-Erk interplay level.","['Li, F', 'Jiang, Q', 'Shi, K J', 'Luo, H', 'Yang, Y', 'Xu, C M']","['Li F', 'Jiang Q', 'Shi KJ', 'Luo H', 'Yang Y', 'Xu CM']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medicine Sciences & School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'F6A27P4Q4R (Selenious Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Selenious Acid/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*physiology']",PMC3730416,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013243 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.243 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jul 4;4:e708. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.243.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We presently investigated whether mild ER stress also sensitizes beta cells to cytokine-induced apoptosis. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)-induced ER stress enhanced the IL-1beta apoptosis in INS-1E and primary rat beta cells. This was not prevented by XBP1 knockdown (KD), indicating the dissociation between the pathways leading to inflammation and cell death. Analysis of the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in cytokine-induced apoptosis indicated a central role for the pro-apoptotic BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only protein Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), which was counteracted by four anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) proteins, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and A1. CPA+IL-1beta-induced beta cell apoptosis was accompanied by increased expression of Bim, particularly the most pro-apoptotic variant, small isoform of Bim (BimS), and decreased expression of A1. Bim silencing protected against CPA+IL-1beta-induced apoptosis, whereas A1 KD aggravated cell death. Bim inhibition protected against cell death caused by A1 silencing under all conditions studied. In conclusion, mild ER stress predisposes beta cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of IL-1beta by disrupting the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. These findings link ER stress to exacerbated apoptosis during islet inflammation and provide potential mechanistic targets for beta cell protection, namely downregulation of Bim and upregulation of A1.","['Miani, M', 'Barthson, J', 'Colli, M L', 'Brozzi, F', 'Cnop, M', 'Eizirik, D L']","['Miani M', 'Barthson J', 'Colli ML', 'Brozzi F', 'Cnop M', 'Eizirik DL']","['Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, rat)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Xbp1 protein, rat)', 'X9TLY4580Z (cyclopiazonic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Indoles', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1beta/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",PMC3730410,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013236 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.236 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Jul 4;4:e701. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that cells from prednisone-resistant T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients showed cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3 in comparison to prednisone-sensitive patients suggesting its inactivation. To determine the impact of FOXO3, T-ALL cells were infected with a 4OH-tamoxifen-regulated, phosphorylation-independent FOXO3(A3)ERtm allele. After FOXO3-activation these cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis. FOXO3 induces the death ligand TRAIL and the BH3-only protein Noxa implicating extrinsic as well as intrinsic death signaling. Whereas dnFADD partially inhibited cell death, CrmA and dnBID efficiently rescued ALL cells after FOXO3 activation, suggesting a caspase-8 amplifying feedback loop downstream of FADD. Knockdown of TRAIL and Noxa reduced FOXO3-induced apoptosis, implicating that mitochondrial destabilization amplifies TRAIL-signaling. The-reconstitution of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A, which sensitizes ALL cells to mitochondria-induced cell death, represses FOXO3 protein levels and reduces the dependency of these leukemia cells on PI3K-PKB signaling. This suggests that if p16INK4A is deleted during leukemia development, FOXO3 levels elevate and FOXO3 has to be inactivated by deregulation of the PI3K-PKB pathway to prevent FOXO3-induced cell death.","['Ausserlechner, Michael J', 'Salvador, Christina', 'Deutschmann, Andrea', 'Bodner, Martin', 'Viola, Giampietro', 'Bortolozzi, Roberta', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Hagenbuchner, Judith', 'Obexer, Petra']","['Ausserlechner MJ', 'Salvador C', 'Deutschmann A', 'Bodner M', 'Viola G', 'Bortolozzi R', 'Basso G', 'Hagenbuchner J', 'Obexer P']","['Department of Pediatrics I, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC3759677,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['953 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.953 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2013 Jul;4(7):995-1007. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.953.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first time the cancer risk in humans has been explored comprehensively in a cohort mortality study (1950-2008) that included all polytetrafluoroethylene production sites in Europe and North America at the time it was initiated. A job-exposure matrix (1950-2002) was developed for TFE and ammonium perfluoro-octanoate, a chemical used in the polymerization process. National reference rates were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals. Among 4,773 workers ever exposed to TFE, we found a lower rate of death from most causes, as well as increased risks for cancer of the liver (SMR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.55, 2.51; 8 deaths) and kidney (SMR = 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.69, 2.65; 10 deaths) and for leukemia (SMR = 1.48; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 2.59; 12 deaths). A nonsignificant upward trend (P = 0.24) by cumulative exposure to TFE was observed for liver cancer. TFE and ammonium perfluoro-octanoate exposures were highly correlated, and therefore their separate effects could not be disentangled. This pattern of findings narrows the range of uncertainty on potential TFE carcinogenicity but cannot conclusively confirm or refute the hypothesis that TFE is carcinogenic to humans.","['Consonni, Dario', 'Straif, Kurt', 'Symons, J Morel', 'Tomenson, John A', 'van Amelsvoort, Ludovic G P M', 'Sleeuwenhoek, Anne', 'Cherrie, John W', 'Bonetti, Paolo', 'Colombo, Ilaria', 'Farrar, David G', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto']","['Consonni D', 'Straif K', 'Symons JM', 'Tomenson JA', 'van Amelsvoort LG', 'Sleeuwenhoek A', 'Cherrie JW', 'Bonetti P', 'Colombo I', 'Farrar DG', 'Bertazzi PA']","[""Epidemiology Unit, Department of Preventive Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda-Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Via San Barnaba, 8, 20122 Milan, Italy. dario.consonni@unimi.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130704,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,"['0 (Fluorocarbons)', 'OMW63Z518S (tetrafluoroethylene)']",IM,"['Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Monitoring/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fluorocarbons/*adverse effects/analysis/chemical synthesis', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/mortality', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Liver Diseases/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', 'Polymerization', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cohort studies', 'mortality', 'neoplasms', 'occupational health', 'polytetrafluoroethylene', 'tetrafluoroethylene']",2013/07/06 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['kws588 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kws588 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2013 Aug 1;178(3):350-8. doi: 10.1093/aje/kws588.

AML patients (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) treated with anthracycline and cytarabine-based remission induction chemotherapy from 2002 to 2009 at Cleveland Clinic were divided into three body mass index (BMI) groups: under/normal weight (BMI </= 24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), and obese (BMI >/= 30.0). Among 247 AML patients, 81 (33%) were under/normal weight, 81 (33%) were overweight, and 85 (34%) were obese. Complete remission (CR) rates were similar among these groups (69.1, 79.0, and 76.5%, respectively; P = 0.321), as was median survival (10.7, 16.7, and 14.2 months, respectively, P = 0.352) and 30-day mortality (3.7, 2.5, 7.1%, respectively, P = 0.331). There was no difference among groups in days to neutrophil or platelet recovery, hospitalization days for induction chemotherapy, and bacteremia. After adjustment for confounders (age, sex, BMI, white blood cells, cytogenetic risk, etiology, and bacteremia), overall survival was significantly shorter for normal weight compared to overweight (P = 0.006) and obese (0.038) patients. Response rates and adverse events were not significantly different among AML patients of all weight classes when induction chemotherapy was dosed according to ABW.

It was demonstrated that PAB induced U937 cell apoptosis, which was confirmed by typical morphological changes and Annexin Vfluorescein isothiocyanate staining. PAB was observed to activate a caspasedependent apoptotic pathway in U937 cells through the regulation of the Bcl2 family protein-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, the activities of caspase3 and -9 were increased following treatment with PAB. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study demonstrated for the first time that PAB was able to enhance the apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through the activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Moreover, the activation of caspase3 and -9 mediated the apoptotic induction.","['Wang, Jia-He', 'Kan, Liang', 'Shu, Lin-Hua', 'Wang, Nan', 'Li, Nai-Jing', 'Zhang, Meng']","['Wang JH', 'Kan L', 'Shu LH', 'Wang N', 'Li NJ', 'Zhang M']","['Department of Geriatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110004, P.R.

Ad5/F11p-SFV-GFP infected >95% of K562, U937 or Jurkat cells and 23.65% of HL-60 cells, and led to moderate Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) transgene expression intensity. The infection efficiency of Ad5/F11p-SFV-GFP in primary human leukemia cells ranged from 9.34-89.63% (median, 28.58%) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, compared with only 3.37-44.54% (median, 10.42%) in cells infected by Ad5/F11p-GFP.

In conclusion, we successfully developed a novel adenoviral-alphavirus hybrid vector with RNA replicon features, which represents a promising vector for gene modifications during the production of cell-based vaccines for leukemia patients.","['Yang, Y', 'Xiao, F', 'Lu, Z', 'Li, Z', 'Zuo, H', 'Zhang, Q', 'Li, Q', 'Wang, H', 'Wang, L-S']","['Yang Y', 'Xiao F', 'Lu Z', 'Li Z', 'Zuo H', 'Zhang Q', 'Li Q', 'Wang H', 'Wang LS']","[""Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130705,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Alphavirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Replicon/*genetics', 'Semliki forest virus/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/06/04 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201337 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2013.37 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2013 Aug;20(8):429-36. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2013.37.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The above plants previously displayed cytotoxicity against leukemia CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cell lines as well as human pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cells. The present study aims at emphasizing the study of the cytotoxicity and the modes of action of the above plants on a panel of ten cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. The study has been extended to the isolation of the bioactive constituents from Echinops giganteus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the extracts was determined using a resazurin reduction assay, whereas the caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases 3/7, caspase 8 and caspase 9 in cells treated with the four extracts. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptotic cells, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: The four tested extracts inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines including sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. Collateral sensitivity of cancer cells to the extract of Echinops giganteus was generally better than to doxorubicin. The recorded IC50 ranges were 3.29 microg/mL [against human knockout clones HCT116 (p53(-/-)) colon cancer cells] to 14.32 microg/mL (against human liver hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells) for the crude extract from Echinops giganteus, 4.17 microg/mL (against breast cancer cells transduced with control vector MDA-MB231 cells) to 19.45 microg/mL (against MDA-MB-231 BCRP cells) for that of Piper capense, 4.11 microg/mL (against leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 30.60 microg/mL (against leukemia HL60AR cells) for Xylopia aethiopica, 3.28 microg/mL [against HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells] to 33.43 microg/mL (against HepG2 cells) for Imperata cylindica and 0.11 microg/mL (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 132.47 microg/mL (against HL60AR cells) for doxorubicin. The four tested extracts induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via the alteration loss of MMP whilst that of Piper capense also enhanced the production of ROS. CONCLUSION: The studied plants are potential cytotoxic drugs that deserve more detailed exploration in the future, to develop novel anticancer drugs against sensitive and otherwise drug-resistant phenotypes.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Sandjo, Louis P', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Sandjo LP', 'Wiench B', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130701,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cameroon', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Echinops Plant/chemistry', '*Ethnopharmacology', 'Humans', '*Medicine, African Traditional', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Piper/chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Poaceae/chemistry', '*Spices', 'Xylopia/chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"[""2',7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate"", ""2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein"", ""5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide"", 'ATP', 'Apaf-1', 'CC', 'Cameroon', 'Cell cycle distribution', 'Cytotoxicity', 'DCF', 'DCM', 'DMSO', 'E. giganteus', 'Echinops giganteus', 'H(2)DCF', 'H(2)DCFH-DA', 'H(2)O(2)', 'I. cylindrica', 'IC(50)', 'Imperata cylindrica', 'JC-1', 'MDR', 'MMP', 'Mitochondrial membrane potential', 'P. capense', 'Piper capense', 'ROS', 'Spices', 'TLC', 'VCC', 'VIN', 'X. aethiopica', 'Xylopia aethiopica', 'adenosine triphospahte', 'apoptotic protease activating factor-1', 'column chromatography', 'ddH(2)O', 'dichlorofluorescein', 'dichloromethane', 'dimethylsufoxide', 'double distilled water', 'inhibitory concentrations 50%', 'melting points', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'mp', 'multidrug resistant', 'oxygenated water', 'reactive oxygen species', 'thin layer chromatography', 'vacuum column chromatography', 'vinblastine']",2013/07/06 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(13)00449-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2013.06.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2013 Aug 26;149(1):245-53. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.06.029.

Here we show that miR-22 is upregulated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia and its aberrant expression correlates with poor survival. To explore its role in hematopoietic stem cell function and malignancy, we generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing miR-22 in the hematopoietic compartment. These mice displayed reduced levels of global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and increased hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal accompanied by defective differentiation. Conversely, miR-22 inhibition blocked proliferation in both mouse and human leukemic cells. Over time, miR-22 transgenic mice developed MDS and hematological malignancies. We also identify TET2 as a key target of miR-22 in this context. Ectopic expression of TET2 suppressed the miR-22-induced phenotypes. Downregulation of TET2 protein also correlated with poor clinical outcomes and miR-22 overexpression in MDS patients. Our results therefore identify miR-22 as a potent proto-oncogene and suggest that aberrations in the miR-22/TET2 regulatory network are common in hematopoietic malignancies.","['Song, Su Jung', 'Ito, Keisuke', 'Ala, Ugo', 'Kats, Lev', 'Webster, Kaitlyn', 'Sun, Su Ming', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca', 'Manova-Todorova, Katia', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Avigan, David E', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Song SJ', 'Ito K', 'Ala U', 'Kats L', 'Webster K', 'Sun SM', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Manova-Todorova K', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Avigan DE', 'Delwel R', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn22 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3767186,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(13)00261-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2013 Jul 3;13(1):87-101. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2013.06.003.,"['R01 CA082328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA141457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK10068901/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK098263/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK100689/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA139009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA141457-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00CA139009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Case 2 was a 52-years old female with hemoglobin level of 79 g/L at admission. They were both diagnosed as PRCA with thymoma before admission to our hospital and had no benefit from their thymectomy. Further examinations in our hospital showed that CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(+)CD57(+) large granular lymphocytes amplified with clonal TCR rearrangement in their peripheral blood. The diagnosis of PRCA with thymoma/T-LGLL was clarified. Case 1 did not respond to any of the frontline therapies while case 2 responded completely to cyclosporine.

METHODS: Four interfering sequences of Nrf2 and one negative control sequence were designed and synthesised based on the principle of target sequence of siRNA, then constructed lentivirus vectors, which were transfected into K562 cell lines. The transfection effect was observed by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and flow cytometer (FCM); The depressing effect of siRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR. The cell proliferation inhibiting rate was measured with CCK-8 assay, the apoptotic rate by Annexin V-PE/PI with FCM and the apoptotic morphology of cells by LSCM. RESULTS: The transfection efficiency of lentivirus was 65%. One cell line K562-C3 which significantly inhibited Nrf2 mRNA was obtained by real-time PCR, Nrf2 relative quantitation (RQ) expressions were 1.003+/-0.093 and 0.344+/-0.032 in the control group and K562-C3 respectively; TrxR expression also decreased with RQ as 1.090+/-0.549 and 0.395+/-0.029 respectively. The cellular proliferation inhibition rates of K562-C3 were (4.74+/-0.39)%, (6.13+/-1.78)% and (25.36+/-3.77)%, respectively at 24, 48 and 72 h. The apoptotic rate induced by K562-C3 (29.9%) at 72 hours was obviously higher than in the control group (7.9%). The Annexin V-PE positive K562-C3 cells presented the following apoptotic characteristics, such as karyopyknosis, nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic bodies observed by LSCM. CONCLUSION: Nrf2 specific siRNA could repress its expression at the cellular level and down-regulate the expression of its downstream antioxidant enzyme, such as TrxR, which lead to increased apoptotic rate and decreased cell proliferation.","['Pan, Fei', 'Xu, Lian-rong', 'Wang, Hong-wei', 'Zhu, Meng-xia', 'Liu, Yan', 'Tan, Yan-hong', 'Chen, Xiu-hua', 'Ren, Fang-gang']","['Pan F', 'Xu LR', 'Wang HW', 'Zhu MX', 'Liu Y', 'Tan YH', 'Chen XH', 'Ren FG']","['Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/*metabolism']",,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.015 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;34(6):527-31. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CD144 in Sup-B15 leukemia cells was stably knock downed via lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (named as Sup-B15/shVEC). The inhibitory effects of IM on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells were measured by CCK-8 test, and the apoptosis of those cells was determined by AnnexinV/7-AAD dyeing using flow cytometry, the percentage of CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells also by flow cytometry. ALDH1 mRNA levels were detected by real-time RT-PCR, and protein levels of CD144, CD133, Bcr-abl and beta-catenin by Western blot. RESULTS: IM treatment presented inhibitory effects on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells at multiple concentrations of IM. The IC50 of IM on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells were 25.1mumol/L and 18.7mumol/L, respectively (P<0.05). After 48h of 20 mumol/L IM treatment, the percentages of apoptosis cell in Sup-B15/shVEC cells and Sup-B15 cell were (13.52+/-2.06)% and (3.03+/-0.72) %, respectively (P<0.05). The percentage of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in Sup-B15 cells was significantly higher than in Sup-B15/shVEC cells [(2.39+/-0.28)% vs (0.96+/-0.07)%, P<0.05). As compared to Sup-B15 cells, the transcription of ALDH1 in Sup-B15/shVEC was remarkably downregulated, and the CD133 protein level was also downregulated in Sup-B15/shVEC cells. Both cytoplasmic and nucleic beta-catenin protein levels (but not for Bcr-abl levels) decreased in Sup-B15/shVEC cells as compare to Sup-B15 cells. CONCLUSION: Knockdown of CD144 sensitized Sup-B15 Ph+ ALL cells to IM. The possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be via inhibiting beta-catenin nucleic translocation and facilitating beta-catenin degradation.","['Zhang, Huan-xin', 'Yan, Zhi-ling', 'Song, Xu-guang', 'Lu, Chao', 'Cao, Jiang', 'Li, Zhen-yu', 'Zeng, Ling-yu', 'Chen, Chong', 'Xu, Kai-lin']","['Zhang HX', 'Yan ZL', 'Song XG', 'Lu C', 'Cao J', 'Li ZY', 'Zeng LY', 'Chen C', 'Xu KL']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Laboratory of Transplantation Immunology, Xuzhou 221000, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.014 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;34(6):522-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Tumor suppressor gene p14(ARF) was transduced into K562 (K562-p14(ARF)) and 4 blast crisis primary CML cells (CML-BC 1-4) using vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vector with cells transduced by empty vector as control. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were applied to measure transduction efficiency, and Western blotting assay was used to detect p14(ARF) protein of K562 cells. WST-8 method was used to determine cell growth inhibition rate of K562 cells transduced by the target gene under different concentrations of imatinib (0, 0.015, 0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mumol/L). Cell apoptosis and leukemic cellular colony-forming ability were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI dyeing using flow cytometry (FCM) and semi-solid culture method respectively. RESULTS: Fluorescence microscopy and FCM showed that transduction efficiency (GFP positive cells) of K562-p14(ARF), K562-VSV and CML-BC1 cells were close to 100%, and CML-BC 2-4 cells were 80% to 90% on average. Results of Western blotting showed that the levels of ARF protein expression of K562 cells transduced by p14(ARF) were significantly higher than of untransduced cells; the apoptosis rate of K562-p14(ARF) was 20%; the mean apoptosis rate of 4 primary leukemic cells transduced by the p14(ARF) [(71.1+/-22.4)%] was significantly higher than of control group [(12.4+/-6.2)%] (P<0.05). Imatinib significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562-p14(ARF) cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mean leukemic cellular colony-forming unit of 4 primary leukemic cells transduced by the p14(ARF) (41.5+/-13.2) was significantly lower than of the control group (88.5+/-7.9) (P<0.05).

Two patients received IM pre- and post-ASCT maintained MCR for 35 and 12 months after ASCT. But the other 3 ASCT recipients without IM died of relapse within 1 year. The transplant-related mortality rate in allo-HSCT group was 12.5%. The estimated 3-year OS in allo-HSCT (n=16), ASCT (n=5) and CT (n=7) groups were (66.7+/-12.2)%, (25.0+/-21.7)% and (16.7+/-15.2)%, respectively (P=0.014); meanwhile, the estimated 3-year DFS in those groups were of (56.3+/-12.4)%, (26.7+/-22.6)% and 0, respectively (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: IM combined with intensive chemotherapy significantly increased the CR rate with the improved quality of CR, which highlighted the feasibility of SCT. Allo-HSCT could decrease relapse to produce favorable OS and DFS in CR1 of young adults with Ph(+) ALL. ASCT combined IM might be the treatment of choice for those achieved MCR but without donors.","['Zhang, Yan-ru', 'Wang, Ting-yu', 'Zou, De-hui', 'Sui, Wei-wei', 'Li, Zeng-jun', 'Xu, Yan', 'Fu, Ming-wei', 'Zhao, Yao-zhong', 'Qi, Jun-yuan', 'Wang, Jian-xiang', 'Mi, Ying-chang', 'Qiu, Lu-gui']","['Zhang YR', 'Wang TY', 'Zou DH', 'Sui WW', 'Li ZJ', 'Xu Y', 'Fu MW', 'Zhao YZ', 'Qi JY', 'Wang JX', 'Mi YC', 'Qiu LG']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital,CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;34(6):493-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.06.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively investigated the leukemia-associated gene transcripts by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction from 151 adult patients with AML associated with the patients' clinical characteristics. The maximum levels of each gene in bone marrow were 64.4-, 8.1-, and 3.9-fold higher than those in the normal control, respectively. In contrast to the WT1 and TERT levels, survivin showed comparatively higher expression in the unfavorable cytogenetic group of patients. We found a significant difference in survivin levels between the CR and non-CR groups (P = 0.0237). TERT expression levels were higher in patients who had a greater number of peripheral blood leukemic blasts at diagnosis (P = 0.0191). Non-MRC subtypes and patients without specific mutations were the most powerful predictive factors for a better CR rate, by multivariate analyses. The lower levels of both WT1 and survivin co-expression (P = 0.0129) and both survivin + TERT co-expression (P = 0.0115) were significant factors for better OS. Besides lower initial levels of serum ferritin (P = 0.0401), lower levels of WT1 (P = 0.0438) and survivin (P = 0.0401), lower levels of both WT1 and survivin co-expression (P = 0.0031), and the three-gene combination of lower WT1 + survivin + TERT (P = 0.0454) were powerful predictive factors for better EFS. As our findings were based on a single disease entity, that is, adult AML, they suggest that the expression of these genes may be critical for the immunobiology of AML to influence the clinical outcome in various ways.","['Kim, Hee-Je', 'Choi, Eun-Jeong', 'Sohn, Hyun-Jung', 'Park, So-Hye', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Tai-Gyu']","['Kim HJ', 'Choi EJ', 'Sohn HJ', 'Park SH', 'Min WS', 'Kim TG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130918,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivin', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', ""Wilms' tumor gene 1"", 'leukemia-associated antigens', 'survivin', 'telomerase reverse transcriptase']",2013/07/06 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12167 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Nov;91(5):411-22. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12167.

In order to explore this in further detail, we sequenced these two mitochondrial genes in diagnostic bone marrow or blood samples in 235 patients with AML. In 37 (16%) patients, a non-synonymous variation in either COI or COII could be demonstrated. No patients harboured both COI and COII non-synonymous variations. Twenty-four (10%) patients had non-synonymous variations in COI, whereas 13 (6%) patients had non-synonymous variations in COII. The COI and COII are essential subunits of cytochrome c oxidase that is the terminal enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. In terms of disease course, we observed that in patients with a normal cytogenetic analysis at disease presentation (CN-AML) treated with curative intent, the presence of a non-synonymous variation in the COII was an adverse prognostic marker for both overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) in both univariate (DFS; hazard ratio (HR) 4.4, P = 0.006) and multivariate analyses (DFS; HR 7.2, P = 0.001). This is the first demonstration of a mitochondrial aberration playing an adverse prognostic role in adult AML, and we argue that its role as a potentially novel adverse prognostic marker in the subset of CN-AML should be explored further.","['Silkjaer, Trine', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg', 'Juhl-Christensen, Caroline', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Norgaard, Jan Maxwell']","['Silkjaer T', 'Nyvold CG', 'Juhl-Christensen C', 'Hokland P', 'Norgaard JM']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 1.9.3.- (cytochrome C oxidase subunit II)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'cytochrome c oxidase subunit II', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'prognosis']",2013/07/06 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12166 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Oct;91(4):295-303. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12166.

EVI1 mRNA expression was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in diagnostic specimens obtained from 206 patients. Expression levels were correlated with clinical features and outcome. EVI1(high) was present in 58/206 (28%) patients. MLL rearrangements occurred in 40% of EVI1(high) patients as opposed to 12% of the EVI1(low/absent) patients (P < 0.001). No abnormalities of 3q26 were found in EVI1(high) patients by conventional cytogenetic analysis, nor were cryptic 3q26 abnormalities detected in a subset of patients screened by next-generation sequencing. French-American-British class M7 was enriched in the EVI1(high) group, accounting for 24% of these patients. EVI1(high) patients had significantly lower 5-year overall survival from study entry (51% vs. 68%, P = 0.015). However, in multivariate analysis including other established prognostic markers, EVI1 expression did not retain independent prognostic significance.

Panobinostat is a potent pan-histone inhibitor of HDAC enzymes implicated in cancer development and progression. Activity has been demonstrated in hematological diseases, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), myeloma and myeloid malignancies. AREAS COVERED: We discuss basic pharmacology, followed by early phase trial results and analyse recent large Phase II trials in HL, CTCL, myeloid malignancies and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Future directions for drug development including potential predictive biomarkers are considered. EXPERT OPINION: The results of Phase II trials prove that oral panobinostat is deliverable with dosing regimens of three times per week, either weekly or biweekly. The major hematologic side-effect of myelosuppression, in particular thrombocytopenia, is transient and manageable, as are the non-hematologic side-effects. Encouraging responses are observed in HL, CTCL, myelofibrosis and WM. The safety and efficacy results from studies of combination therapy with azacitidine in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes suggest that this agent may find a place in the management of a range of hematologic cancers.","['Khot, Amit', 'Dickinson, Michael', 'Prince, H Miles']","['Khot A', 'Dickinson M', 'Prince HM']","['Department of Cancer Medicine, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. amit.khot@petermac.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130703,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Indoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Panobinostat']",,,,2013/07/06 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2013.815165 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2013 Sep;22(9):1211-23. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2013.815165.

Transfusions may affect ALL outcomes through transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). METHODS: We analyzed overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in relation to leukocyte reduced and irradiated (LR/IRR) blood products transfused during the induction phase in 136 children with ALL. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death and relapse were estimated through Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients (89%) were transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 79 (58%) with single donor platelets (SDPs). The median number of transfusions was 2 (interquartile range [IQR]=1-3 events) and 1 (IQR=0-3 events) for PRBCs and SDPs, respectively. Patients who had white blood cell (WBC) count >50,000x10(9)/L, were classified as high risk according to the high National Cancer Institute criteria, displayed a T cell phenotype, or were minimal residual disease-positive at end of induction were more likely to receive >3 transfusions during induction (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively). In univariate analysis, PRBC, SDP, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions did not have any significant association with relapse or death. For PRBC transfusions, the HRs for EFS and OS were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.85-1.24; P=0. 76) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.83-1.27; P=0.76), respectively. For SDP transfusions, HRs were 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.18; P=0.64) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80-1.20; P=0.87) for EFS and OS, respectively. CONCLUSION: LR/IRR blood products may not confer a TRIM effect in childhood ALL and are unlikely to affect outcome.","['Alkayed, Khaldoun', 'Al Hmood, Ammar', 'Madanat, Faris']","['Alkayed K', 'Al Hmood A', 'Madanat F']","['Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130625,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC3698399,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Blood transfusion', 'Prognosis']",2013/07/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:01,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.2.133 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Jun;48(2):133-8. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.2.133.

We investigated gene expression patterns of MSCs with different seeding densities and culture times. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs were plated at densities from 200 cells/cm(2) to 5,000 cells/cm(2), and the gene expression patterns were evaluated over time using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of factors that play a critical role in cell migration and tissue regeneration, such as podocalyxin-like protein (PODXL), alpha4-integrin, alpha6-integrin, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were higher in MSCs plated at 200 cells/cm(2) than in MSCs plated at 5,000 cells/cm(2). The mRNA levels of these factors gradually increased for 10 days and then decreased by day 15 in culture. MSCs seeded at 200 cells/cm(2) that were cultured for 10 days expressed high levels of Oct-4 and Nanog. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, cyclooxygenase-1, and hepatocyte growth factor expression were upregulated in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma in these cells. CONCLUSION: We found differences in the gene expression patterns of MSCs under different culture conditions. MSCs from 10-day cultures seeded at a low density were efficiently expanded, expressed PODXL, alpha6-integrin, alpha4-integrin, and LIF, and maintained properties like stemness and immunomodulation. Therefore, ex vivo expansion of MSCs maintained for an adequate culture time after plating at low cell density can provide an effective regenerative medicinal strategy for cell therapies using MSCs.","['Lee, Myoung Woo', 'Kim, Dae Seong', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Kim, Hye Ryung', 'Jang, In Keun', 'Lee, Ji Hyang', 'Kim, So Yeon', 'Son, Meong Hi', 'Lee, Soo Hyun', 'Jung, Hye Lim', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe']","['Lee MW', 'Kim DS', 'Yoo KH', 'Kim HR', 'Jang IK', 'Lee JH', 'Kim SY', 'Son MH', 'Lee SH', 'Jung HL', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130625,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC3698395,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell therapy', 'Culture time', 'Gene expression pattern', 'Mesenchymal stem cell', 'Seeding density']",2013/07/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:01,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.2.107 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Jun;48(2):107-14. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.2.107.

Reduced BMD is associated with an increased risk for fractures. Pamidronate, a second-generation bisphosphonate, has been used to treat osteoporosis in children. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of pamidronate in children with low BMD during and after chemotherapy for ALL and NHL. METHODS: Between April 2007 and October 2011, 24 children with ALL and NHL were treated with pamidronate. The indication was a decreased BMD Z-score less than -2.0 or bone pain with a BMD Z-score less than 0. Pamidronate was infused at 1 mg/kg/day for 3 days at 1-4 month intervals (pamidronate group, cases). The BMD Z-scores of the cases were compared with those of 10 untreated patients (control group). Lumbar spine BMDs were measured every 6 cycles using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and Z-scores were calculated. Bone turnover parameters (25-hydroxyvitamin D, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, and type I collagen c-terminal telopeptide) were analyzed. RESULTS: The median cycle of pamidronate treatment was 12. Increases in BMD Z-scores were significantly higher in the pamidronate group than in the control group (P<0.001). BMD (mg/cm(2)) increased in all pamidronate-treated cases. Twenty patients who complained of bone pain reported pain relief after therapy. The treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Pamidronate appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of children with low BMD during and after chemotherapy for ALL and NHL.","['Lee, Jae Min', 'Kim, Ji Eun', 'Bae, Soon Hwan', 'Hah, Jeong Ok']","['Lee JM', 'Kim JE', 'Bae SH', 'Hah JO']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130625,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC3698414,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Bisphosphonate', 'Bone mineral density', 'Corticosteroids', 'NHL', 'Pamidronate']",2013/07/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:01,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2013.48.2.99 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2013 Jun;48(2):99-106. doi: 10.5045/br.2013.48.2.99.

The use of azacitidine is expanding rapidly, but limited comparative clinical trial data are available to (i) define the optimal use of azacitidine in patients with higher-risk MDS or around the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (ii) identify those patients with lower-risk MDS who may benefit from treatment, and (iii) guide physicians on alternative therapies after treatment failure. Increasing evidence suggests that the clinical features, prognostic factors, and cytogenetic profiles of patients with MDS in Asia differ significantly from those of patients in Western countries, so the aim of this review is to summarize the evidence and provide practical recommendations on the use of azacitidine in patients with MDS in the Republic of Korea.

These cytokines share the membrane gp130 as a common signal transducer. Recently, it was demonstrated that IL-6 promotes, whereas LIF inhibits fetal lung branching. Thus, in this study, the effects on fetal lung morphogenesis of the other classical members of the gp130-type cytokines (IL-11, CLC, CNTF, CT-1 and OSM) were investigated. We also provide the first description of these cytokines and their common gp130 receptor protein expression patterns during rat lung development. Fetal rat lung explants were cultured in vitro with increasing concentrations of IL-11, CLC, CNTF, CT-1 and OSM. Treated lung explants were morphometrically analyzed and assessed for MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 signaling modifications. IL-11, which similarly to IL-6 acts through a gp130 homodimer receptor, significantly stimulated lung growth via p38 phosphorylation. On the other hand, CLC, CNTF, CT-1 and OSM, whose receptors are gp130 heterodimers, inhibited lung growth acting in different signal-transducing pathways. Thus, the present study demonstrated that although cytokines of the gp130 family share a common signal transducer, there are specific biological activities for each cytokine on lung development. Indeed, cytokine signaling through gp130 homodimers stimulate, whereas cytokine signaling through gp130 heterodimers inhibit lung branching.","['Nogueira-Silva, Cristina', 'Piairo, Paulina', 'Carvalho-Dias, Emanuel', 'Veiga, Carla', 'Moura, Rute S', 'Correia-Pinto, Jorge']","['Nogueira-Silva C', 'Piairo P', 'Carvalho-Dias E', 'Veiga C', 'Moura RS', 'Correia-Pinto J']","['Life and Health Sciences Research Institute, School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Lung/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3691159,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067607 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-14236 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 24;8(6):e67607. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067607.

PRELP is structurally similar to FMOD with adjacent localization on chromosome 1 (1q32.1). As cluster-upregulation of genes may occur in malignancies, the aim of our study was to analyze PRELP expression in CLL. PRELP was expressed (RT-PCR) in all CLL patients (30/30), as well as in some patients with mantle cell lymphoma (3/5), but not in healthy donor leukocytes (0/20) or tumor samples from other hematological malignancies (0/35). PRELP was also detected in CLL cell-lines (4/4) but not in cell-lines from other hematological tumors (0/9). PRELP protein was detected in all CLL samples but not in normal leukocytes. Deglycosylation experiments revealed a CLL-unique 38 kDa core protein, with an intact signal peptide. This 38 kDa protein was, in contrast to the normal 55 kDa size, not detected in serum which, in combination with the uncleaved signal peptide, suggests cellular retention. The unique expression of a 38 kDa PRELP in CLL cells may suggest involvement in the pathobiology of CLL and merits further studies.","['Mikaelsson, Eva', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Ostadkarampour, Mahyar', 'Hadavi, Reza', 'Gholamin, Mehran', 'Akhondi, Mehdi', 'Shokri, Fazel', 'Rabbani, Hodjattallah', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Mikaelsson E', 'Osterborg A', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Kokhaei P', 'Ostadkarampour M', 'Hadavi R', 'Gholamin M', 'Akhondi M', 'Shokri F', 'Rabbani H', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Cancer Centre Karolinska, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. eva.mikaelsson@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PRELP protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/blood/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycoproteins/blood/*genetics/immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Isoforms/blood/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3691130,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067601 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-03650 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 24;8(6):e67601. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067601.

But its expression and roles have rarely been discussed in hematological malignancies. Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been shown to not only possess antitumor effects but also potentiate the activity of other chemotherapeutics. In this study, we demonstrated that 11beta-HSD2 was highly expressed in two GC-resistant T-cell leukemic cell lines Jurkat and Molt4. In contrast, no 11beta-HSD2 expression was found in two GC-sensitive non-hodgkin lymphoma cell lines Daudi and Raji as well as normal peripheral blood T cells. Inhibition of 11beta-HSD2 by 11beta-HSD inhibitor 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid or 11beta-HSD2 shRNA significantly increased cortisol-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Additionally, pretreatment of Jurkat cells with low-dose bortezomib resulted in increased cellular sensitivity to GC as shown by elevated induction of apoptosis, more cells arrested at G1 stage and up-regulation of GC-induced leucine zipper which is an important mediator of GC action. Furthermore, we clarified that bortezomib could dose-dependently inhibit 11beta-HSD2 messenger RNA and protein levels as well as activity (cortisol-cortisone conversion) through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Therefore, we suggest 11beta-HSD2 is, at least partially if not all, responsible for impaired GC suppression in Jurkat cells and also indicate a novel mechanism by which proteasome inhibitor bortezomib may influence GC action.","['Tao, Yi', 'Gao, Lu', 'Wu, Xiaosong', 'Wang, Hongmei', 'Yang, Guang', 'Zhan, Fenghuang', 'Shi, Jumei']","['Tao Y', 'Gao L', 'Wu X', 'Wang H', 'Yang G', 'Zhan F', 'Shi J']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 1.1.1.146 (11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC3691151,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067067 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-00153 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 24;8(6):e67067. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067067.

Imatinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, resistance to imatinib may be acquired by BCR-Abl mutations or hyperactivation of Src family kinases such as Lyn. We have used multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads (MIBs) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to compare kinase expression and activity in an imatinib-resistant (MYL-R) and -sensitive (MYL) cell model of CML. Using MIB/MS, expression and activity changes of over 150 kinases were quantitatively measured from various protein kinase families. Statistical analysis of experimental replicates assigned significance to 35 of these kinases, referred to as the MYL-R kinome profile. MIB/MS and immunoblotting confirmed the over-expression and activation of Lyn in MYL-R cells and identified additional kinases with increased (MEK, ERK, IKKalpha, PKCbeta, NEK9) or decreased (Abl, Kit, JNK, ATM, Yes) abundance or activity. Inhibiting Lyn with dasatinib or by shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of MEK and IKKalpha. Because MYL-R cells showed elevated NF-kappaB signaling relative to MYL cells, as demonstrated by increased IkappaBalpha and IL-6 mRNA expression, we tested the effects of an IKK inhibitor (BAY 65-1942). MIB/MS and immunoblotting revealed that BAY 65-1942 increased MEK/ERK signaling and that this increase was prevented by co-treatment with a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Furthermore, the combined inhibition of MEK and IKKalpha resulted in reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, synergistic loss of cell viability and increased apoptosis. Thus, MIB/MS analysis identified MEK and IKKalpha as important downstream targets of Lyn, suggesting that co-targeting these kinases may provide a unique strategy to inhibit Lyn-dependent imatinib-resistant CML. These results demonstrate the utility of MIB/MS as a tool to identify dysregulated kinases and to interrogate kinome dynamics as cells respond to targeted kinase inhibition.","['Cooper, Matthew J', 'Cox, Nathan J', 'Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Dewar, Brian J', 'Duncan, James S', 'Whittle, Martin C', 'Nguyen, Thien A', 'Jones, Lauren S', 'Ghose Roy, Sreerupa', 'Smalley, David M', 'Kuan, Pei Fen', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Christopherson, Richard I', 'Jin, Jian', 'Frye, Stephen V', 'Johnson, Gary L', 'Baldwin, Albert S', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Cooper MJ', 'Cox NJ', 'Zimmerman EI', 'Dewar BJ', 'Duncan JS', 'Whittle MC', 'Nguyen TA', 'Jones LS', 'Ghose Roy S', 'Smalley DM', 'Kuan PF', 'Richards KL', 'Christopherson RI', 'Jin J', 'Frye SV', 'Johnson GL', 'Baldwin AS', 'Graves LM']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3691232,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066755 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-32322 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 24;8(6):e66755. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066755.

The traditional approach uses supervised learning, in which an expert designates which patterns to look for (by specifying the learning task and the class labels), and where to look for them (by specifying the input variables). While appropriate for individual tasks, this approach scales poorly and misses the patterns that we don't think to look for. Unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying patterns (or features) that collectively form a compact and expressive representation of the source data, with no need for expert input or labeled examples. Its rising popularity is driven by new deep learning methods, which have produced high-profile successes on difficult standardized problems of object recognition in images. Here we introduce its use for phenotype discovery in clinical data. This use is challenging because the largest source of clinical data - Electronic Medical Records - typically contains noisy, sparse, and irregularly timed observations, rendering them poor substrates for deep learning methods. Our approach couples dirty clinical data to deep learning architecture via longitudinal probability densities inferred using Gaussian process regression. From episodic, longitudinal sequences of serum uric acid measurements in 4368 individuals we produced continuous phenotypic features that suggest multiple population subtypes, and that accurately distinguished (0.97 AUC) the uric-acid signatures of gout vs. acute leukemia despite not being optimized for the task.

High levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) produced by BM stromal cells in the BM niche regulate cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, depending on the cellular context. Exogenous TGFbeta1 induced accumulation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in a quiescent G0 state, which was further facilitated by the co-culture with BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In turn, TGFbeta-neutralizing antibody 1D11 abrogated rhTGFbeta1 induced cell cycle arrest. Blocking TGFbeta with 1D11 further enhanced cytarabine (Ara-C)-induced apoptosis of AML cells in hypoxic and in normoxic conditions. Additional constituents of BM niche, the stroma-secreted chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play crucial roles in cell migration and stroma/leukemia cell interactions. Treatment with 1D11 combined with CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor and Ara-C decreased leukemia burden and prolonged survival in an in vivo leukemia model. These results indicate that blockade of TGFbeta by 1D11 and abrogation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy against AML cells in the hypoxic BM microenvironment.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Shi, Yue Xi', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Jin, Linhua', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Hatanaka, Yasuhito', 'Miida, Takashi', 'Hsu, Frank J', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Tabe Y', 'Shi YX', 'Zeng Z', 'Jin L', 'Shikami M', 'Hatanaka Y', 'Miida T', 'Hsu FJ', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America ; Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130627,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/physiology']",PMC3695026,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:01,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0062785 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-32582 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 27;8(6):e62785. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062785.

Heterozygous deletion of Mll2 induced in the adult mouse results in a normal phenotype suggesting that changes in chromatin methylation during development result in the adult phenotype.

Here, we bridge this gap by developing an immunohistochemical (IHC) stain that detects a neoepitope created by the proteolytic cleavage event that activates NOTCH1. Following validation using xenografted cancers and normal tissues with known patterns of NOTCH1 activation, we applied this test to tumors linked to dysregulated Notch signaling by mutational studies. As expected, frequent NICD1 staining was observed in T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, a tumor in which activating NOTCH1 mutations are common. However, when IHC was used to gauge NOTCH1 activation in other human cancers, several unexpected findings emerged. Among B cell tumors, NICD1 staining was much more frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia than would be predicted based on the frequency of NOTCH1 mutations, while mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma showed no evidence of NOTCH1 activation. NICD1 was also detected in 38% of peripheral T cell lymphomas. Of interest, NICD1 staining in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and in angioimmunoblastic lymphoma was consistently more pronounced in lymph nodes than in surrounding soft tissues, implicating factors in the nodal microenvironment in NOTCH1 activation in these diseases. Among carcinomas, diffuse strong NICD1 staining was observed in 3.8% of cases of triple negative breast cancer (3 of 78 tumors), but was absent from 151 non-small cell lung carcinomas and 147 ovarian carcinomas. Frequent staining of normal endothelium was also observed; in line with this observation, strong NICD1 staining was also seen in 77% of angiosarcomas. These findings complement insights from genomic sequencing studies and suggest that IHC staining is a valuable experimental tool that may be useful in selection of patients for clinical trials.","['Kluk, Michael J', 'Ashworth, Todd', 'Wang, Hongfang', 'Knoechel, Birgit', 'Mason, Emily F', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Dorfman, David', 'Pinkus, Geraldine', 'Weigert, Oliver', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Chirieac, Lucian R', 'Hirsch, Michelle', 'Oh, David J', 'South, Andrew P', 'Leigh, Irene M', 'Pourreyron, Celine', 'Cassidy, Andrew J', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Krop, Ian E', 'Dillon, Deborah', 'Brock, Jane E', 'Lazar, Alexander J F', 'Peto, Myron', 'Cho, Raymond J', 'Stoeck, Alexander', 'Haines, Brian B', 'Sathayanrayanan, Sriram', 'Rodig, Scott', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Kluk MJ', 'Ashworth T', 'Wang H', 'Knoechel B', 'Mason EF', 'Morgan EA', 'Dorfman D', 'Pinkus G', 'Weigert O', 'Hornick JL', 'Chirieac LR', 'Hirsch M', 'Oh DJ', 'South AP', 'Leigh IM', 'Pourreyron C', 'Cassidy AJ', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Weinstock DM', 'Krop IE', 'Dillon D', 'Brock JE', 'Lazar AJ', 'Peto M', 'Cho RJ', 'Stoeck A', 'Haines BB', 'Sathayanrayanan S', 'Rodig S', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130618,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3688991,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:01,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0067306 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-13213 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 18;8(6):e67306. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0067306.

It is now used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies, including imatinib. Here we report a novel effect of dasatinib on inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through MEK/ERK-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). We found that dasatinib could induce the differentiation of AML cells as demonstrated by the expression of differentiation marker CD11b, G0/G1 phase arrest and decreased ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Of note, dasatinib induced robust phosphorylation of STAT1 both at Tyr701 and Ser727 as well as the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus leading to the transcription of STAT1-targeted genes. Knocking down STAT1 expression by shRNA significantly attenuated dasatinib-induced differentiation, indicating an important role of STAT1 in myeloid maturation. We further found that dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was regulated by the MEK/ERK kinases. The phosporylation of MEK and ERK occurred rapidly upon dasatinib treatment and increased progressively as differentiation was induced. MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0216 not only inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, but also abrogated dasatinib-induced myeloid differentiation, suggesting that MEK/ERK dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 might be indispensable for the differentiating effect of dasatinib in AML cells. Taken together, our study suggests that STAT1 is an important mediator in dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells, whose activation requires the activation of MEK/ERK cascades.","['Fang, Yanfen', 'Zhong, Like', 'Lin, Meihua', 'Zhou, Xinglu', 'Jing, Hui', 'Ying, Meidan', 'Luo, Peihua', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Fang Y', 'Zhong L', 'Lin M', 'Zhou X', 'Jing H', 'Ying M', 'Luo P', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",PMC3692534,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066915 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-08551 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 25;8(6):e66915. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066915.

BACKGROUND: Liver regeneration is an important phenomenon after liver injury. The rat partial hepatectomy (PH) model was used to characterize liver regeneration and Mcl-1L expression after PH. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 70% PH. The expression of mcl-1L mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry during liver regeneration. Functional evaluations of Mcl-1L were tested using chemical inhibition (flavopiridol), genetic inhibition (siRNA) of Mcl-1L production, and by assaying for annexin V levels and DNA ladder formation. Serum IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme immunoassays; signal transduction of IL-6-regulated Mcl-1L expression was verified by chemical inhibitors and decoy double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. RESULTS: High levels of Mcl-1L were observed in remnant tissue at 4 h after PH. Administration of flavopiridol decreased Mcl-1L accumulation and also inhibited liver regeneration. IL-6 administration promoted the accumulation of Mcl-1L in rat hepatocytes, an effect that was impaired by siRNA treatments that reduced Mcl-1L production. Chemical inhibition and decoy oligonucleotide competition demonstrated that IL-6-induced Mcl-1L production required signaling mediated by JAK kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and cAMP response-element-binding (CREB) proteins. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1L is an anti-apoptotic protein induced during liver regeneration after PH in rats. The expression of Mcl-1L is induced by IL-6 through the JAK/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway. Chemotherapy drugs that depend on Mcl-1L- or IL-6-related signaling should be considered carefully before use in patients undergoing hepatectomy for malignant tumor resection.","['Chou, Chia-Hung', 'Lai, Shuo-Lun', 'Chen, Chiung-Nien', 'Lee, Po-Huang', 'Peng, Fu-Chuo', 'Kuo, Min-Liang', 'Lai, Hong-Shiee']","['Chou CH', 'Lai SL', 'Chen CN', 'Lee PH', 'Peng FC', 'Kuo ML', 'Lai HS']","['Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatectomy', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/blood/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",PMC3692501,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066268 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39038 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 25;8(6):e66268. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066268.

Identification of SHP2-selective inhibitors could lead to the development of new drugs that ultimately serve as treatments for PTPN11-associated diseases. As the catalytic core of SHP2 shares extremely high homology to those of SHP1 and other PTPs that play negative roles in cell signaling, to identify selective inhibitors of SHP2 using computer-aided drug design, we targeted a protein surface pocket that is adjacent to the catalytic site, is predicted to be important for binding to phosphopeptide substrates, and has structural features unique to SHP2. From computationally selected candidate compounds, #220-324 effectively inhibited SHP2 activity with an IC50 of 14 mumol/L. Fluorescence titration experiments confirmed its direct binding to SHP2. This active compound was further verified for its ability to inhibit SHP2-mediated cell signaling and cellular function with minimal off-target effects. Furthermore, mouse myeloid progenitors with the activating mutation (E76K) in PTPN11 and patient leukemic cells with the same mutation were more sensitive to this inhibitor than wild-type cells.

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) of these 2 gammaretrovirus subtypes are largely segregated in different house mouse subspecies, but both MLV types are found in the classical strains of laboratory mice, which are genetic mosaics of 3 wild mouse subspecies. To describe the subspecies origins of laboratory mouse XP-MLV ERVs and their coevolutionary trajectory with their XPR1 receptor, we screened the house mouse subspecies for known and novel Xpr1 variants and for the individual full-length XP-MLV ERVs found in the sequenced C57BL mouse genome. The 12 X-MLV ERVs predate the origins of laboratory mice; they were all traced to Japanese wild mice and are embedded in the 5% of the laboratory mouse genome derived from the Asian Mus musculus musculus and, in one case, in the <1% derived from M. m. castaneus. While all 31 P-MLV ERVs map to the 95% of the laboratory mouse genome derived from P-MLV-infected M. m. domesticus, no C57BL P-MLV ERVs were found in wild M. m. domesticus. All M. m. domesticus mice carry the fully permissive XPR1 receptor allele, but all of the various restrictive XPR1 receptors, including the X-MLV-restricting laboratory mouse Xpr1(n) and a novel M. m. castaneus allele, originated in X-MLV-infected Asian mice. Thus, P-MLV ERVs show more insertional polymorphism than X-MLVs, and these differences in ERV acquisition and fixation are linked to subspecies-specific and functionally distinct XPR1 receptor variants.","['Bamunusinghe, Devinka', 'Liu, Qingping', 'Lu, Xiaoyu', 'Oler, Andrew', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Bamunusinghe D', 'Liu Q', 'Lu X', 'Oler A', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130703,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Animals, Wild/genetics/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Host Specificity/*genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Mice/classification/*genetics/*virology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",PMC3754108,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01264-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01264-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Sep;87(17):9845-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01264-13.

In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, registrational trial (MDS-004; n = 205) in this patient population, a significantly higher proportion of lenalidomide recipients than placebo recipients achieved red blood cell transfusion independence for >/=26 consecutive weeks (primary endpoint for efficacy) and cytogenetic responses. The erythroid response to lenalidomide was accompanied by an increase in the haemoglobin levels. These efficacy outcomes are generally consistent with those seen in an earlier noncomparative registrational trial (MDS-003; n = 148). In MDS-004, lenalidomide also significantly improved health-related quality of life compared with placebo at 12 weeks. Retrospective analyses that compared outcomes between lenalidomide-treated patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk del(5q) MDS and multicentre registry cohorts showed that lenalidomide treatment did not appear to increase the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Lenalidomide had a manageable safety profile in the registrational trials, with </=20 % of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. The most common adverse events (incidence >/=20 %) occurring in lenalidomide recipients were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which were generally managed by dosage reductions and/or interruptions, and/or pharmacotherapy. Thus, lenalidomide is a useful option for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk del(5q) MDS, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.","['Syed, Yahiya Y', 'Scott, Lesley J']","['Syed YY', 'Scott LJ']","['Adis, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, North Shore, 0754, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'Chromosome 5q Deletion Syndrome']",IM,"['Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Anemia, Macrocytic/*complications/genetics', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/29 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40265-013-0071-x [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2013 Jul;73(11):1183-96. doi: 10.1007/s40265-013-0071-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cell cycle proteins regulate terminal mitosis, the factors that influence the cell cycle machinery are incompletely understood. Here we show in mice that myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein required for the survival of NPCs, also regulates their terminal differentiation through the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1). A BrdU-Ki67 cell profiling assay revealed that in utero electroporation of Mcl1 into NPCs in the embryonic neocortex increased NPC cell cycle exit (the leaving fraction). This was further supported by a decrease in proliferating NPCs (Pax6(+) radial glial cells and Tbr2(+) neural progenitors) and an increase in differentiating cells (Dcx(+) neuroblasts and Tbr1(+) neurons). Similarly, BrdU birth dating demonstrated that Mcl1 promotes premature NPC terminal mitosis giving rise to neurons of the deeper cortical layers, confirming their earlier birthdate. Changes in Mcl1 expression within NPCs caused concomitant changes in the levels of p27(Kip1) protein, a key regulator of NPC differentiation. Furthermore, in the absence of p27(Kip1), Mcl1 failed to induce NPC cell cycle exit, demonstrating that p27(Kip1) is required for Mcl1-mediated NPC terminal mitosis. In summary, we have identified a novel physiological role for anti-apoptotic Mcl1 in regulating NPC terminal differentiation.","['Hasan, S M Mahmudul', 'Sheen, Ashley D', 'Power, Angela M', 'Langevin, Lisa Marie', 'Xiong, Jieying', 'Furlong, Michael', 'Day, Kristine', 'Schuurmans, Carol', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Vanderluit, Jacqueline L']","['Hasan SM', 'Sheen AD', 'Power AM', 'Langevin LM', 'Xiong J', 'Furlong M', 'Day K', 'Schuurmans C', 'Opferman JT', 'Vanderluit JL']","[""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St John's, NL A1B 3V6, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Dcx protein, mouse)', '0 (Doublecortin Protein)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Doublecortin Protein', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitosis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neurogenesis', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Cdkn1b', 'Cell cycle', 'Mcl-1', 'Mouse', 'Neurogenesis']",2013/07/05 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.090910 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.090910 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2013 Aug;140(15):3118-27. doi: 10.1242/dev.090910.

Articles focusing on the intrinsic determinants of axon regeneration were selected. RESULTS: Like other CNS neurons of mammals, RGCs undergo a developmental loss in their ability to grow axons as they mature, which is a critical contributing factor to the failure of nerve regeneration and repair after injury. This growth failure can be attributed, at least in part, by the induction of molecular programs preventing cellular overgrowth and termination of axonal growth upon maturation. Key intracellular signals and transcription factors, including B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2, cyclic adenine monophosphate, mammalian target of rapamycin, and Kruppel-like transcription factors, have been identified to play central roles in this process. CONCLUSIONS: Intense effort and substantial progress have been made to identify the various intrinsic growth pathways that regulate RGC axon regeneration. More work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of and the interrelationship between the actions of these factors and to successfully achieve regeneration and repair of the severed RGC axons.","['Zhu, Rui-lin', 'Cho, Kin-sang', 'Guo, Chen-ying', 'Chew, Justin', 'Chen, Dong-feng', 'Yang, Liu']","['Zhu RL', 'Cho KS', 'Guo CY', 'Chew J', 'Chen DF', 'Yang L']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University First Hospital, Key Laboratory of Vision Loss and Restoration, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100034, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/physiology', '*Nerve Regeneration', 'Optic Nerve/*physiology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2013 Jul;126(13):2543-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to assess the leukemia-free survival (LFS) and some primary results, such as hematologic recovery, risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, and long-term survival, after unrelated cord blood transplantation compared with the outcomes of transplantations from other unrelated graft source. METHODS: The clinical outcomes of 112 consecutive patients with acute leukemia who received umbilical cord blood (UCBT) as a primary unrelated stem cell source (n = 38), bone marrow (UBMT n = 28, transplanted before January 2003), or peripheral blood stem cells (UPBSCT n = 46, transplanted after January 2003) between July 2000 and July 2008 were analyzed. RESULTS: Except that the patients were much younger in the UCBT group (median age, 10.5 years in UCBT, 30 years in UPBSCT, and 20 years in UBMT), other pre-transplant parameters, such as gender, diagnosis, and the phase of disease, were comparable. All patients received myeloablative regimens, primarily including BUCY; however, there was less anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) used for the UBMT patients (2/38 in UCBT, 0/46 in UPBSCT, and 8/28 in UBMT did not use ATG, P = 0.000). Significant delays in engraftment occurred after UCBT for both neutrophil cells and platelets. The cumulative allo-engraftment rates were also significantly lower (87.8% vs. 97.8% vs. 100% for WBC, P = 0.000; 73.0% vs. 97.5% vs. 89.5% for PLT, P = 0.000) for UCBT. The incidence of Grade 2-4 and 3-4 acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) was much higher in the UBMT group but did not differ among the other groups (51% and 13.2%, 40.2% and 10.5%, and 77.4% and 41.2%, respectively, for UCBT, UPBSCT, and UBMT, P = 0.000). The occurrence of extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was significantly decreased for recipients of UCBT (4%) compared with that of UPBSCT (39.1%) and UBMT (49.1%, P = 0.000), although the rates of whole cGVHD were not significantly different (30.3%, 63.1%, and 60.1% for UCBT, UPBSCT, and UBMT, respectively). The patients had a similar rate of CMV infection (21/38, 28/46, and 22/28 for UCBT, UPBSCT, and UBMT, respectively), while the HC occurrence was lower after UCBT (7/38, 16/46, and 14/28 for UCBT, UPBSCT, and UBMT, respectively). As of August 2012, there was no apparent difference in 5-year overall survival (OS), LFS, or the relapse rate for each graft source (52.5%, 52.6%, and 20.8% in UCBT; 48.7%, 46.4%, and 27.9% in UPBSCT; and 46.4%, 42.9%, and 16.0% in UBMT).

To identify relapse-associated aberrations, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of 307 uniformly treated, consecutive pediatric ALL cases accrued during 1992-2011. Recurrent aberrations of 14 genes in patients who subsequently relapsed or had induction failure were detected. Of these, deletions/uniparental isodisomies of ADD3, ATP10A, EBF1, IKZF1, PAN3, RAG1, SPRED1 and TBL1XR1 were significantly more common in B-cell precursor ALL patients who relapsed compared with those remaining in complete remission. In univariate analyses, age (>/=10 years), white blood cell counts (>100 x 10(9)/l), t(9;22)(q34;q11), MLL rearrangements, near-haploidy and deletions of ATP10A, IKZF1, SPRED1 and the pseudoautosomal 1 regions on Xp/Yp were significantly associated with decreased 10-year event-free survival, with IKZF1 abnormalities being an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis irrespective of the risk group. Older age and deletions of IKZF1 and SPRED1 were also associated with poor overall survival.

We recently demonstrated that the rexinoid, bexarotene, induces differentiation and therapeutic responses in patients with refractory AML. Rexinoids bind and activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs); however, rexinoids alone are incapable of activating retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/RXR complexes, suggesting that myeloid differentiation can occur independent of RAR. In this study, we demonstrate that rexinoid differentiation of AML cells is RAR independent and requires the expression of PU.1. Because of the promiscuousness of RXR with other nuclear receptors, myeloid differentiation by bexarotene with other nuclear receptor ligands was explored. Bexarotene cooperated with ATRA to enhance differentiation in some AML cell lines; however, the combination of bexarotene with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone did not. In contrast, bexarotene combined with liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, T0901317 or GW3965, induced potent differentiation and cytotoxicity in AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, but not in normal progenitor cells. These results suggest that RXR/LXR-regulated gene expression in normal cells is deregulated in AML cells and identifies a potential role for these agonists in differentiation therapy of non-APLs.","['Sanchez, P V', 'Glantz, S T', 'Scotland, S', 'Kasner, M T', 'Carroll, M']","['Sanchez PV', 'Glantz ST', 'Scotland S', 'Kasner MT', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA, USA.', 'Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130704,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', '0 (Liver X Receptors)', '0 (Nicotinic Acids)', '0 (Orphan Nuclear Receptors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TO-901317)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'A61RXM4375 (Bexarotene)', 'UVU4X1103P (LG 100268)']",IM,"['Bexarotene', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Liver X Receptors', 'Nicotinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*physiology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013202 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.202 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):749-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.202.

A prospective multicenter trial of combined immunochemotherapy for advanced-stage B-NHL with rituximab and the modified NHL-BFM-90 protocol was conducted. The major differences from the original protocol were a decrease in the dose of MTX from 5000 to 1000 mg/m/24 h in the first 2 ChT blocks and the addition of rituximab at 375 mg/m to each of the first 4 blocks of ChT. Eighty-three newly diagnosed patients with a median age of 8.84 years with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas stage III to IV were included. Four patients died during induction ChT due to tumor lysis syndrome and infection. Two additional patients died subsequently due to tumor resistance.

Metformin is an oral antidiabetic biguanide that may cause metabolic acidosis and liver enzyme abnormalities of possible concern in patients receiving chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: We reviewed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with corticosteroids and asparaginase who received metformin for control of hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received metformin, including 4 who received insulin before starting metformin therapy. Twelve were treated during initial induction therapy and 5 during relapse reinduction. Corticosteroids included dexamethasone in 11, prednisone in 5, and megesterol in 1. Fifteen received pegasparaginase.Patients were treated with metformin for a median of 6 days (range, 2 to 46 d). Metformin was started at a median glucose level of 286 mg/dL (range, 112 to 499 mg/mL). The glucose level was controlled with metformin alone in 12 patients without the need for insulin. Four patients received insulin before or concomitantly with metformin. In 1 patient, metformin failed to control the glucose level, and insulin was administered.No significant toxicity from metformin was seen. Two patients had an elevated anion gap and creatinine level because of extreme hyperglycemia. One patient had mild elevation in total bilirubin and 5 patients had mild elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is safe and effective for therapy-induced hyperglycemia. Initially, insulin may be required for significant hyperglycemia or metabolic abnormalities. We are unaware of any prior studies using metformin in this population.","['Bostrom, Bruce', 'Uppal, Priya', 'Chu, Julie', 'Messinger, Yoav', 'Gandrud, Laura', 'McEvoy, Robert']","['Bostrom B', 'Uppal P', 'Chu J', 'Messinger Y', 'Gandrud L', 'McEvoy R']","[""Departments of *Pediatric Hematology/Oncology daggerPediatric Endocrinology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Metformin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31829cdeba [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Oct;35(7):504-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31829cdeba.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of the translocation-generated fusion proteins retain the DNA binding activity of Runx1, but lose subnuclear targeting and associated transactivation potential. Complete loss of these functions in vivo resembles Runx1 ablation, which causes embryonic lethality. We developed a knock-in mouse that expresses full-length Runx1 with a mutation in the subnuclear targeting cofactor interaction domain, Runx1(HTY350-352AAA). Mutant mice survive to adulthood, and hematopoietic stem cell emergence appears to be unaltered. However, defects are observed in multiple differentiated hematopoietic lineages at stages where Runx1 is known to play key roles. Thus, a germline mutation in Runx1 reveals uncoupling of its functions during developmental hematopoiesis from subsequent differentiation across multiple hematopoietic lineages in the adult. These findings indicate that subnuclear targeting and cofactor interactions with Runx1 are important in many compartments throughout hematopoietic differentiation.","['Dowdy, Christopher R', 'Frederick, Dana', 'Zaidi, Sayyed K', 'Colby, Jennifer L', 'Lian, Jane B', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Gerstein, Rachel M', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Dowdy CR', 'Frederick D', 'Zaidi SK', 'Colby JL', 'Lian JB', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Gerstein RM', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130630,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', '*Point Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",PMC3909992,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00564-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Nov;41(11):980-991.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.06.006.

However, transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites (TFBSs) in promoters are important for inducing and coordinating changes in RNA levels, and thus represent the first layer of functional interaction. Similar to genes, TFs act only in context, which is why a TF/TFBS-based promoter analysis of genes needs to be done in the form of gene(TF)-gene networks, not individual TFs or TFBSs. In addition, integration of the literature and various databases (e.g. GO, MeSH, etc) allows the adding of genes relevant for the functional context of the data even if they were initially missed by the microarray as their RNA levels did not change significantly. Here, we outline a TF-TFBSs network-based strategy to assess the involvement of transcription factors in agonist signaling and demonstrate its utility in deciphering the response of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Our strategy identified a central core of eight TFs, of which only STAT3 had previously been definitively linked to LIF in endothelial cells. We also found potential molecular mechanisms of gene regulation in HMEC-1 upon stimulation with LIF that allow for the prediction of changes of genes not used in the analysis. Our approach, which is readily applicable to a wide variety of expression microarray and next generation sequencing RNA-seq results, illustrates the power of a TF-gene networking approach for elucidation of the underlying biology.","['Werner, Thomas', 'Dombrowski, Susan M', 'Zgheib, Carlos', 'Zouein, Fouad A', 'Keen, Henry L', 'Kurdi, Mazen', 'Booz, George W']","['Werner T', 'Dombrowski SM', 'Zgheib C', 'Zouein FA', 'Keen HL', 'Kurdi M', 'Booz GW']","['Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany. wernersbc@me.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3873763,['NOTNLM'],"['high-throughput (HT) approaches', 'microarray data analysis', 'transcription factor binding sites', 'transcription factor-gene networking', 'transcription factors']",2013/07/05 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ecn.2013.0336 [pii]', '10.1684/ecn.2013.0336 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2013 Jun;24(2):75-90. doi: 10.1684/ecn.2013.0336.,['R01 HL088101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS537349'],,,,,,,,

However, it exhibits a low oral bioavailability (only 9% in mice), because of low permeability across the intestine membrane and rapid metabolism to inactive metabolite. To utilize the carrier-mediated prodrug approach for improved absorption of decitabine, a series of amino acid-decitabine conjugates were synthesized to target the intestinal membrane transporter, hPepT1. The Caco-2 permeability of the prodrugs was screened, and two l-val (aliphatic, compound 4a) and l-phe (aromatic, compound 4c) prodrugs with higher permeability were selected for further studies. The uptake of Gly-Sar by Caco-2 cells could be competitively inhibited by compounds 4a and 4c, with IC50 being 2.20 +/- 0.28 mM and 3.46 +/- 0.16 mM, respectively. The uptake of compounds 4a and 4c was markedly increased in the leptin-treated Caco-2 cells compared with the control Caco-2 cells, suggesting that hPepT1-mediated transport contributes to oral absorption of compounds 4a and 4c. The prodrugs were evaluated for their stability in various phosphate buffers, rat plasma, tissue homogenates, and gastrointestinal fluids. Compounds 4a and 4c were stable in gastrointestinal tract at pH 6.0 but could be quickly converted into DAC in plasma and tissue homogenates after absorption. The oral absolute bioavailability of DAC was 46.7%, 50.9%, and 26.9% after compounds 4a, 4c, and DAC were orally administered to rats at a dose of 15 mg/kg, respectively. The bioavailability of compounds 4a and 4c in rats was both reduced to about 32% when orally coadministrated with typical hPepT1 substrate Gly-Sar (150 mg/kg). Overall, compounds 4a and 4c can significantly enhance the intestinal membrane permeability of DAC, followed by rapid and mostly bioactivation to parent drug in intestinal and hepatic tissues before entry into systemic circulation, and eventually improve oral bioavailability of DAC in rats. The hPepT1-targeted prodrug strategy is a promising strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed decitabine.","['Zhang, Youxi', 'Sun, Jin', 'Gao, Yikun', 'Jin, Ling', 'Xu, Youjun', 'Lian, He', 'Sun, Yongbing', 'Sun, Yinghua', 'Liu, Jianyu', 'Fan, Rui', 'Zhang, Tianhong', 'He, Zhonggui']","['Zhang Y', 'Sun J', 'Gao Y', 'Jin L', 'Xu Y', 'Lian H', 'Sun Y', 'Sun Y', 'Liu J', 'Fan R', 'Zhang T', 'He Z']","['Department of Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , No. 103, Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130717,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp400233x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 Aug 5;10(8):3195-202. doi: 10.1021/mp400233x.

Although a lot of progress has been made in developing analysis tools for these models, there is still a need to find approaches that can directly relate the network structure to its dynamics. Of special interest is identifying the stable patterns of activity, i.e., the attractors of the system. This is a problem for large networks, because the state space of the system increases exponentially with network size. In this work, we present a novel network reduction approach that is based on finding network motifs that stabilize in a fixed state. Notably, we use a topological criterion to identify these motifs. Specifically, we find certain types of strongly connected components in a suitably expanded representation of the network. To test our method, we apply it to a dynamic network model for a type of cytotoxic T cell cancer and to an ensemble of random Boolean networks of size up to 200. Our results show that our method goes beyond reducing the network and in most cases can actually predict the dynamical repertoire of the nodes (fixed states or oscillations) in the attractors of the system.","['Zanudo, Jorge G T', 'Albert, Reka']","['Zanudo JG', 'Albert R']","['Department of Physics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802-6300, USA. jgtz@phys.psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Chaos,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",100971574,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics', '*Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Time Factors']",,,,2013/07/05 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1063/1.4809777 [doi]'],ppublish,Chaos. 2013 Jun;23(2):025111. doi: 10.1063/1.4809777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective information was collected for all referrals to the Department of Pain and Palliative Care (DPPC) over a four-year period. This included inpatient/outpatient status, diagnosis, symptoms, and goals of the referring clinician; and information linked to hospital inpatient data to obtain date and location of death. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: All hematology referrals were from January 2007 to December 2010. RESULTS: Hematology referrals constituted 11.6% of all referrals received during the study period. Outpatient referrals increased significantly with each year, as did the proportion of patients referred for symptom control. The median time from referral to death was 34 days, with poorest survival seen in acute leukemia and inpatients. Overall, 54% of inpatient hematology deaths had consultation from the DPPC, with these patients less likely to die in the intensive care unit.

We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the transition from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) to CLL and tested miR-15a/16-1 cluster, miR-21, and miR-155 expression in purified B cells of normal individuals, individuals with MBL, and patients with CLL. When we analyzed 224 samples from 2 independent training and validation cohorts, we found that miR-155 was overexpressed in B cells from individuals with MBL, and even more so in B cells from patients with CLL, when compared with B cells from normal individuals. Furthermore, we were able to identify miR-155 in circulating microvesicles from both individuals with MBL and patients with CLL. Next, to examine the prognostic role of miR-155, we measured its expression level in plasma samples collected before treatment initiation in 228 patients with CLL. We found significantly higher miR-155 expression levels in patients who failed to achieve a complete response compared with those who experienced complete response. Our findings support the use of cellular and plasma levels of miR-155 as biomarkers for the risk of progression in individuals with MBL, as well as to identify patients with CLL who may not respond well to therapy.","['Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Ivan, Cristina', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Nouraee, Nazila', 'Ikuo, Mariko', 'Ghosh, Asish K', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Reuben, James M', 'Calin, Steliana', 'You, M James', 'Manning, John T', 'Wierda, William G', 'Estrov, Zeev', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Calin, George A']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Ivan C', 'Shimizu M', 'Rabe KG', 'Nouraee N', 'Ikuo M', 'Ghosh AK', 'Lerner S', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Xiao L', 'Hu J', 'Reuben JM', 'Calin S', 'You MJ', 'Manning JT', 'Wierda WG', 'Estrov Z', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kipps TJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Kay NE', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130702,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Microvessels/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3779381,,,2013/07/04 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)52946-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-478222 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Sep 12;122(11):1891-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-478222.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia receiving inhibitors of c-Abl tyrosine kinase often show reduced bone remodeling due to impaired osteoblast and osteoclast function. BMP-2 plays a significant role in bone generation and resorption by contributing to the formation of mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The effects of c-Abl on BMP-2-induced bone remodeling and the underlying mechanisms are not well studied. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and expression of a dominant negative mutant of c-Abl, we show an essential role of this tyrosine kinase in the development of bone nodules containing mature osteoblasts and formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in response to BMP-2. Calvarial osteoblasts prepared from c-Abl null mice showed the absolute requirement of this tyrosine kinase in maturation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt signaling by BMP-2 leads to osteoblast differentiation. Remarkably, inhibition of c-Abl significantly suppressed BMP-2-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and its downstream Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, c-Abl regulated BMP-2-induced osteoclastogenic CSF-1 expression. More importantly, we identified the requirements of c-Abl in BMP-2 autoregulation and the expressions of alkaline phosphatase and osterix that are necessary for osteoblast differentiation. c-Abl contributed to BMP receptor-specific Smad-dependent transcription of CSF-1, osterix, and BMP-2. Finally, c-Abl associates with BMP receptor IA and regulates phosphorylation of Smad in response to BMP-2. We propose that activation of c-Abl is an important step, which induces into two signaling pathways involving noncanonical PI 3-kinase and canonical Smads to integrate BMP-2-induced osteogenesis.","['Ghosh-Choudhury, Nandini', 'Mandal, Chandi C', 'Das, Falguni', 'Ganapathy, Suthakar', 'Ahuja, Seema', 'Ghosh Choudhury, Goutam']","['Ghosh-Choudhury N', 'Mandal CC', 'Das F', 'Ganapathy S', 'Ahuja S', 'Ghosh Choudhury G']","['Veterans Affairs Research, South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, Texas 78229, USA. choudhury@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130702,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Smad5 Protein)', '0 (Smad5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sp7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Skull/cytology/metabolism', 'Smad5 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sp7 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3750149,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)', 'Colony-stimulating Factor-1 (CSF-1)', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclast', 'PI 3-Kinase', 'SMAD Transcription Factor', 'c-Abl']",2013/07/04 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45205-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.455733 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Aug 23;288(34):24503-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.455733.

Multivariate analysis showed that gender and disease status (p = 0.0059, p = 0.0039, respectively) were significant factors for OS. Among 51 patients with CR (complete remission), multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with OS included gender (p = 0.014), number of white blood cell at diagnosis (p = 0.025), and the source of stem cells (bone marrow <BM > versus cord blood; BM stem cell source was associated with favorable OS, p = 0.042). Twenty-one patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a median of 207 days (range, 19-1,324 days). The estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years was 39.4%. Patients with CR showed a lower relapse rate at 3 years (34.2%) when compared with patients with non-CR (62.7%). Among 21 patients, eight patients received imatinib-based chemotherapy and 13 received chemotherapy without imatinib before HSCT. In terms of treatment after relapse, seven patients received chemotherapy with imatinib and 13 received chemotherapy without imatinib. Five patients underwent a second HSCT. One patient survived, and 20 patients died. In this study, disease status at time of allo-HSCT had a significant impact on OS, DFS, and relapse.

Experimental researchers have convincingly linked BMI1 to tumorigenesis. However, there is no study about the issue on the role of BMI1 in the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of bladder cancer. To address this question, we examined the expression of BMI1 in bladder cancer tissues and used siRNA to knockdown BMI1 expression in bladder cancer T24 cells. Then we tested the cell proliferation by CCK8 assay and soft agar colony formation assay, apoptosis by flow cytometry assay, and cell invasiveness by transwell migration assay. Our results revealed that BMI1 promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and progression in bladder cancer. Over-expression of BMI1 was correlated with tumor clinic-pathological features. BMI1 siRNA effectively inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and it promoted bladder cancer invasion, maybe by causing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our findings suggested that BMI1 may represent a novel diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for bladder cancer, and deserves further investigation.","['Liang, Wu', 'Zhu, Dingjun', 'Cui, Xuejiang', 'Su, Jiarui', 'Liu, Hongwei', 'Han, Jinli', 'Zhao, Fengjin', 'Xie, Wenlian']","['Liang W', 'Zhu D', 'Cui X', 'Su J', 'Liu H', 'Han J', 'Zhao F', 'Xie W']","[""Department of Urology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107 Yan-jiang West Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510120, People's Republic of China, doctorliangwu@sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/metabolism', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder/metabolism/pathology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",PMC3771375,,,2013/07/04 06:00,2014/09/24 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-013-1745-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2013 Oct;382(1-2):283-91. doi: 10.1007/s11010-013-1745-0.

Previous studies demonstrated negative regulation of G-CSFR through endosomal-lysosomal routing and ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation. However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Our data shows that Fbw7 also interacts with and degrades G-CSFR-T718 (a truncated mutant of G-CSFR found in severe congenital neutropenia/acute myeloid leukemia (SCN/AML patients)) though at a quite slower rate compared to G-CSFR. We further show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), like Fbw7 also targets G-CSFR and G-CSFR-T718 for degradation; however, Fbw7 and GSK3beta are interdependent in targeting G-CSFR/G-CSFR-T718 for degradation because they are unable to degrade G-CSFR individually when either of them is knocked down. We further show that Fbw7 mediated downregulation of G-CSFR inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation which is required for G-CSF dependent granulocytic differentiation. In addition, our data also shows that inhibition of Fbw7 restores G-CSFR signaling leading to enhanced STAT3 activity resulting in massive granulocytic differentiation. These data indicate that Fbw7 together with GSK3beta negatively regulates G-CSFR expression and its downstream signaling.","['Lochab, Savita', 'Pal, Pooja', 'Kapoor, Isha', 'Kanaujiya, Jitendra Kumar', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar']","['Lochab S', 'Pal P', 'Kapoor I', 'Kanaujiya JK', 'Sanyal S', 'Behre G', 'Trivedi AK']","['Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.', 'Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.', 'Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.', 'Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.', 'Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Leipzig, Johannissallee 32A, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Drug Target Discovery and Development Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector-10, Jankipuram Extension, Lucknow, 226031 UP, India.

Nrf2 is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and, upon stimulation by an oxidative or electrophilic insult, is rapidly activated by protein stabilization. Owing to its cytoprotective functions, Nrf2 has been traditionally studied in the field of chemoprevention; however, there is accumulated evidence that Keap1/Nrf2 mutations or unbalanced regulation that leads to overexpression or hyperactivation of Nrf2 may participate in tumorigenesis and be involved in chemoresistance of a wide number of solid cancers and leukemias. In addition to protecting cells from reactive oxygen species, Nrf2 seems to play a direct role in cell growth control and is related to apoptosis-regulating pathways. Moreover, Nrf2 activity is connected with oncogenic kinase pathways, structural proteins, hormonal regulation, other transcription factors, and epigenetic enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of various types of tumors. The aim of this review is to compile and summarize existing knowledge of the oncogenic functions of Nrf2 to provide a solid basis for its potential use as a molecular marker and pharmacological target in cancer.","['Ganan-Gomez, Irene', 'Wei, Yue', 'Yang, Hui', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria Carmen', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Ganan-Gomez I', 'Wei Y', 'Yang H', 'Boyano-Adanez MC', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of System Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Unit, University of Alcala, 28871 Alcala de Henares (Madrid), Spain.

This heterogeneity is thought to depend on the accumulation of secondary mutations enhancing proliferation/survival and/or blocking differentiation in a small subset of leukemia-initiating cells capable of self-renewal. This model of clonal evolution is based on xenotransplantation studies demonstrating that leukemia can be initiated and maintained in immunodeficient mice by a small subset of purified leukemic cells immunophenotypically similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells and is known as the leukemia stem cell model. Since its original formulation, many studies have validated the main conclusion of this model. However, recent data from xenotransplantation studies in more severely immunodeficient mice suggest that imunophenotype and behavior of leukemic stem cells is more heterogeneous and ""plastic"" than originally thought.

METHODS: We propose the screened selection design (SSD), which is a practical multi-stage, randomised Phase II design for two experimental arms. Activity is first evaluated by applying Simon's two-stage design (1989) on each arm. If both are active, the play-the-winner selection strategy proposed by Simon, Wittes and Ellenberg (SWE) (1985) is applied to select the superior arm. A variant of the design, Modified SSD, also allows the arm with the higher response rates to be recommended only if its activity rate is greater by a clinically-relevant value. The operating characteristics are explored via a simulation study and compared to a Bayesian Selection approach. RESULTS: Simulations showed that with the proposed SSD, it is possible to retain the sample size as required in SWE and obtain similar probabilities of selecting the correct superior arm of at least 90%; with the additional attractive benefit of reducing the probability of selecting ineffective arms. This approach is comparable to a Bayesian Selection Strategy. The Modified SSD performs substantially better than the other designs in selecting neither arm if the underlying rates for both arms are desirable but equivalent, allowing for other factors to be considered in the decision making process. Though its probability of correctly selecting a superior arm might be reduced, it still performs reasonably well. It also reduces the probability of selecting an inferior arm. CONCLUSIONS: SSD provides an easy to implement randomised Phase II design that selects the most promising treatment that has shown sufficient evidence of activity, with available R codes to evaluate its operating characteristics.","['Yap, Christina', 'Pettitt, Andrew', 'Billingham, Lucinda']","['Yap C', 'Pettitt A', 'Billingham L']","['MRC Midland Hub for Trials Methodology Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. c.yap@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130703,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,,IM,"['Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*standards', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Research Design']",PMC3726070,,,2013/07/04 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2013/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-13-87 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-13-87 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2013 Jul 3;13:87. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-13-87.,['G0800808/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Aqueous and organic solvent extracts from the leaves and rhizomes of lesser galangal and turmeric, and from the rhizomes only of ginger were examined for their antiproliferative activities against THP-1 AMoL cells in vitro. Lesser galangal leaf extracts in organic solvents of methanol, chloroform, and dichloromethane maintained distinctive antiproliferative activities over a 48-h period. The turmeric leaf and rhizome extracts and ginger rhizome extracts in methanol also showed distinctive anticancer activities. The lesser galangal leaf methanol extract was subsequently separated into 13, and then 18 fractions using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions 9 and 16, respectively, showed the greatest antiproliferative activities. These results indicate that the use of plant extracts might be a safer approach to finding a lasting cure for AMoL.

The use of the (18)FDG-PET can help to detect earlier hematological neoplasm in cases of paraneoplastic syndrome without a determined cause and to treat more rapidly and specifically the patient.","['Cammilleri, Serge', 'Guzian, Marie Caroline', 'Mattei, Jean-Pierre', 'Mundler, Olivier', 'Guis, Sandrine']","['Cammilleri S', 'Guzian MC', 'Mattei JP', 'Mundler O', 'Guis S']","['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, AP-HM, Faculte de Medecine de Marseille, Hopital La Timone, Aix-Marseille University, 27 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130602,United States,Case Rep Med,Case reports in medicine,101512910,,,,PMC3684035,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/07/03 06:01,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/594704 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Med. 2013;2013:594704. doi: 10.1155/2013/594704.

Here, we have identified bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins (Brd2, -3, -4) as cellular-binding partners of MLV integrase. We show that purified recombinant Brd4(1-720) binds with high affinity to MLV integrase and stimulates correct concerted integration in vitro. JQ-1, a small molecule that selectively inhibits interactions of BET proteins with modified histone sites impaired MLV but not HIV-1 integration in infected cells. Comparison of the distribution of BET protein-binding sites analyzed using ChIP-Seq data and MLV-integration sites revealed significant positive correlations. Antagonism of BET proteins, via JQ-1 treatment or RNA interference, reduced MLV-integration frequencies at transcription start sites. These findings elucidate the importance of BET proteins for MLV integration efficiency and targeting and provide a route to developing safer MLV-based vectors for human gene therapy.","['Sharma, Amit', 'Larue, Ross C', 'Plumb, Matthew R', 'Malani, Nirav', 'Male, Frances', 'Slaughter, Alison', 'Kessl, Jacques J', 'Shkriabai, Nikolozi', 'Coward, Elizabeth', 'Aiyer, Sriram S', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Wu, Li', 'Roth, Monica J', 'Bushman, Frederic D', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka']","['Sharma A', 'Larue RC', 'Plumb MR', 'Malani N', 'Male F', 'Slaughter A', 'Kessl JJ', 'Shkriabai N', 'Coward E', 'Aiyer SS', 'Green PL', 'Wu L', 'Roth MJ', 'Bushman FD', 'Kvaratskhelia M']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130701,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azepines', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Integrases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site/*physiology', 'Triazoles', 'Virus Integration/genetics/*physiology']",PMC3718171,['NOTNLM'],"['retroviral gene therapy', 'virus-host interactions']",2013/07/03 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1307157110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1307157110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 16;110(29):12036-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1307157110.

In contrast to the frequent down-regulation (or loss-of-function mutations) and critical tumor-suppressor roles of the three TET genes observed in various types of cancers, here we show that TET1 is a direct target of MLL-fusion proteins and is significantly up-regulated in MLL-rearranged leukemia, leading to a global increase of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level. Furthermore, our both in vitro and in vivo functional studies demonstrate that Tet1 plays an indispensable oncogenic role in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemia, through coordination with MLL-fusion proteins in regulating their critical cotargets, including homeobox A9 (Hoxa9)/myeloid ecotropic viral integration 1 (Meis1)/pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (Pbx3) genes.

In the present study, the antiallergic properties of a standardized aqueous extract of S. baicalensis were evaluated, and the skin toxicity of its dermal application was also determined. The in vivo and in vitro assays were performed by using the beta-hexosaminidase assay in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) and cutaneous skin reaction in BALB/c mice, respectively. In addition, the acute dermal irritation/corrosion test was carried out in New Zealand white rabbits, and the skin sensitization test was conducted by Buhler's method in Hartley guinea pigs to estimate the safety of the standardized aqueous extract of S. baicalensis for topical application. beta-Hexosaminidase release in RBL-2H3 was markedly decreased following treatment with the standardized aqueous extract of S. baicalensis.

We aimed to investigate the genomic and epigenetic features of this entity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytogenomic analysis was conducted with 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays on 16 tumor specimens and four cell lines. LINE-1 methylation, a surrogate marker of DNA methylation, was conducted on 27 cases using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: tRCC showed cytogenomic heterogeneity, with 31.2% and 18.7% of cases presenting similarities with clear-cell and papillary RCC profiles, respectively. The most common alteration was a 17q gain in seven tumors (44%), followed by a 9p loss in six cases (37%). Less frequent were losses of 3p and 17p in five cases (31%) each. Patients with 17q gain were older (P=0.0006), displayed more genetic alterations (P<0.003), and had a worse outcome (P=0.002) than patients without it. Analysis comparing gene-expression profiling of a subset of tumors bearing 17q gain and those without suggest large-scale dosage effects and TP53 haploinsufficiency without any somatic TP53 mutation identified. Cell line-based cytogenetic studies revealed that 17q gain can be related to isochromosome 17 and/or to multiple translocations occurring around 17q breakpoints. Finally, LINE-1 methylation was lower in tRCC tumors from adults compared with tumors from young patients (71.1% vs. 76.7%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal genomic heterogeneity of tRCC with similarities to other renal tumor subtypes and raise important questions about the role of TFEB/TFE3 translocations and other chromosomal imbalances in tRCC biology.","['Malouf, Gabriel G', 'Monzon, Federico A', 'Couturier, Jerome', 'Molinie, Vincent', 'Escudier, Bernard', 'Camparo, Philippe', 'Su, Xiaoping', 'Yao, Hui', 'Tamboli, Pheroze', 'Lopez-Terrada, Dolores', 'Picken, Maria', 'Garcia, Marileila', 'Multani, Asha S', 'Pathak, Sen', 'Wood, Christopher G', 'Tannir, Nizar M']","['Malouf GG', 'Monzon FA', 'Couturier J', 'Molinie V', 'Escudier B', 'Camparo P', 'Su X', 'Yao H', 'Tamboli P', 'Lopez-Terrada D', 'Picken M', 'Garcia M', 'Multani AS', 'Pathak S', 'Wood CG', 'Tannir NM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Pathology & Immunology and Human & Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genetics and INSERM U830, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Hopital Saint Joseph, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Hopital Foch, Suresnes, France.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pathology, Loyola University Hospital, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pathology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Urology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130701,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (TFEB protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC3882157,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3825 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Sep 1;19(17):4673-84. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3825.

Two isoforms of human TGC were cloned from human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells induced with retinoic acid (RA) and termed TGH, 63 kDa (Fraij et al. in J Biol Chem 267:22616-22673, 1992) and TGH2, 37 kDa. The purified TGC isoforms exhibited GTPase activity and TGH and TGH2 showed higher activities than the native TGC protein. In all normal cells examined, TGC was found in membrane fractions several fold higher than the supernatant fractions; however, in the natural tumor cell line HEL the TGC cellular distribution was reversed. Although TGC is the major enzyme in normal human erythrocytes, its expression level was significantly decreased in HEL cells. RA treatment induced a sevenfold increase in the level of TGC protein in HEL cells and was accompanied by its translocation to cell membranes. When isolated membrane and supernatant fractions from normal human foreskin (CF3), normal human embryonic lung (WI-38), and HEL cells treated with or without RA were incubated with [(32)P]-ATP at 37 degrees C for 1 h, more radio-labeled proteins were detected in the membrane fractions than the cytosolic fractions. More labeled protein bands were detected in RA treated HEL cells in comparison to control HEL cell extracts. Radio labeled proteins coimmunoprecipitated with the TGC isoforms in RA treated HEL membrane fractions thereby confirming that the radio-labeled material consists of endogenous proteins associated with TGC isoforms. Protein phosphorylation is related to the induction and translocation of the isoforms in RA treated cells. These results show that the TGC isoforms complexes with proteins in vivo and that the phosphorylation of these proteins is catalyzed directly by TGC kinase activity or indirectly by the TGC phosphorylation of other protein kinases.","['Fraij, Bassam M']",['Fraij BM'],"['Biology and Chemistry Department, Benedict College, Columbia, SC 29204, USA. fraijb@benedict.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Netherlands,Protein J,The protein journal,101212092,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transglutaminases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10930-013-9499-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein J. 2013 Aug;32(6):426-34. doi: 10.1007/s10930-013-9499-9.,"['3SC3GM086322-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5SC3GM086322-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS A systematic review of literature derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies on follow-up after autotransplantation; detection of cancer cells in ovarian tissue from oncological patients by histology, polymerase chain reaction or xenotransplantation; and epidemiological data on ovarian metastases were included. RESULTS A total of 289 studies were included. Metastases were repeatedly detected in ovarian tissue obtained for cryopreservation purposes from patients with leukaemia, as well as in one patient with Ewing sarcoma. No metastases were detected in ovarian tissue from lymphoma and breast cancer patients who had their ovarian tissue cryopreserved. Clinical studies indicated that one should be concerned about autotransplantation safety in patients with colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancer. For patients with low-stage cervical carcinoma, clinical data were relatively reassuring, but studies focused on the detection of metastases were scarce. Oncological recurrence has been described in one survivor of cervical cancer and one survivor of breast cancer who had their ovarian tissue autotransplanted, although these recurrences may not be related to the transplantation. CONCLUSIONS It is advisable to refrain from ovarian tissue autotransplantation in survivors of leukaemia. With survivors of all other malignancies, current knowledge regarding the safety of autotransplantation should be discussed. The most reassuring data regarding autotransplantation safety were found for lymphoma patients.","['Bastings, L', 'Beerendonk, C C M', 'Westphal, J R', 'Massuger, L F A G', 'Kaal, S E J', 'van Leeuwen, F E', 'Braat, D D M', 'Peek, R']","['Bastings L', 'Beerendonk CC', 'Westphal JR', 'Massuger LF', 'Kaal SE', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Braat DD', 'Peek R']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (791), Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. l.bastings@obgyn.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20130630,England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,,IM,"['Contraindications', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ovary/*pathology/*transplantation', 'Survivors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['autotransplantation', 'cancer', 'fertility preservation', 'ovarian tissue', 'safety']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['dmt020 [pii]', '10.1093/humupd/dmt020 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2013 Sep-Oct;19(5):483-506. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmt020.

Overexpression of CXCR4 has been associated with poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We have previously shown that ligand-mediated phosphorylation of the Serine339 (CXCR4-S339) residue of the intracellular domain by PIM1 is implicated in surface re-expression of this receptor. Here, we report that phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339 in bone marrow (BM) biopsies correlated with poor prognosis in a cohort of AML patients. To functionally address the impact of CXCR4-S339 phosphorylation, we generated cell lines-expressing CXCR4 mutants that mimic constitutive phosphorylation (S339E) or abrogate phosphorylation (S339A). Whereas the expression of CXCR4 significantly increased, both CXCR4-S339E and the CXCR4-S339A mutants significantly reduced the BM homing and engraftment of Kasumi-1 AML cells in immunodeficient mice. In contrast, only expression of the CXCR4-S339E mutant increased the BM retention of the cells and resistance to cytarabine treatment, and impaired detachment capacity and AMD3100-induced mobilization of engrafted leukemic cells. These observations suggest that the poor prognosis in AML patients displaying CXCR4-S339 phosphorylation can be the consequence of an increased retention to the BM associated with an enhanced chemoresistance of leukemic cells. Therefore, CXCR4-S339 phosphorylation could serve as a novel prognostic marker in human AML.","['Brault, L', 'Rovo, A', 'Decker, S', 'Dierks, C', 'Tzankov, A', 'Schwaller, J']","['Brault L', 'Rovo A', 'Decker S', 'Dierks C', 'Tzankov A', 'Schwaller J']","[""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130702,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Serine/*chemistry']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013201 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.201 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):566-76. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.201.

Despite such widespread involvements, the relationship between RUNX1 and MLL has never been appreciated. Recently, we showed that RUNX1 physically and functionally interacts with MLL, thereby regulating the epigenetic status of critical cis-regulatory elements for hematopoietic genes. This newly unveiled interaction between the two most prevalent leukemia genes has solved a long-standing conundrum: leukemia-associated RUNX1 N-terminal point mutants that exhibit no obvious functional abnormalities in classical assays for the assessment of transcriptional activities. These mutants turned out to be defective in MLL interaction and subsequent epigenetic modifications that can be examined by the histone-modification status of cis-regulatory elements in the target genes. RUNX1/MLL binding confirms the importance of RUNX1 function as an epigenetic regulator. Recent studies employing next-generation sequencing on human hematological malignancies identified a plethora of mutations in epigenetic regulator genes. These new findings would enhance our understanding on the mechanistic basis for leukemia development and may provide a novel direction for therapeutic applications.

The pattern and number of non-synonymous mutations show that the MGUS disease stage is less genetically complex than MM, and HR-SMM is similar to presenting MM. Intraclonal heterogeneity is present at all stages and using cases of HR-SMM, which transformed to MM, we show that intraclonal heterogeneity is a typical feature of the disease.

The high affinity of dasatinib for the protein is currently assumed to result from its ability to bind both the active and inactive conformations of the BCR-ABL kinase. In the present work, using state of the art molecular simulation techniques we prove that dasatinib exhibits a highly selective preference for the active (open) BCR-ABL conformation. By using three different BCR-ABL conformations (active, inactive, and intermediate inactive) we show that, from a thermodynamic standpoint, the affinity of dasatinib for BCR-ABL drastically decreases in the order: active > alternative inactive > inactive, as a result of differential contributions from the single residues lining the kinase binding pocket and the concomitant stabilization/destabilization of the kinase hydrophobic spine. Molecule-pulling experiments also corroborate this trend as significantly lower forces and smaller times are required to extract dasatinib from its inactive BCR-ABL complexes with respect to the active complex counterparts. Importantly, our results support recent NMR solution results demonstrating no evidence of dasatinib bound to the inactive form of BCR-ABL.","['Laurini, Erik', 'Posocco, Paola', 'Fermeglia, Maurizio', 'Gibbons, Don L', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Pricl, Sabrina']","['Laurini E', 'Posocco P', 'Fermeglia M', 'Gibbons DL', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Pricl S']","['Molecular Simulations Engineering (MOSE) Laboratory - DEA, University of Trieste, Piazzale Europa 1, 34127 Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130615,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC5528448,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Binding mode', 'Dasatinib', 'Hydrophobic-spine', 'Resistance']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/04/20 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1574-7891(13)00085-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molonc.2013.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2013 Oct;7(5):968-75. doi: 10.1016/j.molonc.2013.06.001.

Here, putative phosphorylation sites on p115RhoGEF are identified and characterized. Mutation of Ser(330) leads to a decrease in serum response element-mediated transcription as well as decreased activation by Galpha13 in vitro. Additionally, this study provides the first report of the binding kinetics between full-length p115RhoGEF and RhoA in its various nucleotide states and examines the binding kinetics of phospho-mutant p115RhoGEF to RhoA. These data, together with other recent reports on regulatory mechanisms of p115RhoGEF, suggest that this putative phosphorylation site serves as a means for initiation or relief of autoinhibition of p115RhoGEF, providing further insight into the regulation of its activity.","['Chow, Christina R', 'Suzuki, Nobuchika', 'Kawamura, Takeshi', 'Hamakubo, Takao', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Chow CR', 'Suzuki N', 'Kawamura T', 'Hamakubo T', 'Kozasa T']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 835 S.

Most NKTCL present extranodal, as a destructive tumor affecting the nose and upper aerodigestive tract (nasal NKTCL) or any organ or tissue (extranasal NKTCL) whereas ANKCL manifests as a systemic disease with multiorgan involvement and naturally evolutes to death in a few weeks. The histopathological hallmark of these aggressive NK-cell tumors is a polymorphic neoplastic infiltrate with angiocentricity, angiodestruction and tissue necrosis. The tumor cells have cytoplasmatic azurophilic granules and usually show a CD45(+bright), CD2(+), sCD3(-), cytCD3epsilon(+), CD56(+bright), CD16(-/+), cytotoxic granules molecules(+) phenotype. T-cell receptor genes are in germ-line configuration. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -encoded membrane proteins and early region EBV RNA are usually detected on lymphoma cells, with a pattern suggestive of a latent viral infection type II. Complex chromosomal abnormalities are frequent and loss of chromosomes 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p are recurrent aberrations.

But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD. METHODS/DESIGN: Based on this underlying treatment concept and on promising data taken from preclinical results and a small pilot study, an open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II-study is conducted to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the investigational antibody FBTA05 in combination with DLI for patients suffering from rituximab- and/or alemtuzumab-refractory, CD20-positive low- or high-grade lymphoma after allogeneic SCT. During the first trial phase with emphasis on dose escalation a maximum of 24 patients distributed into 4 cohorts will be enrolled. For the evaluation of preliminary efficacy data a maximum of 12 patients (6 patients with low-grade lymphoma and/or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / 6 patients with high-grade or aggressive lymphoma) will attend the second phase of this clinical trial. DISCUSSION: Promising data (e.g. induction of cellular immunity; GVL predominance over GVHD; achievement of partial or complete responses; prolongation of time-to-progression) obtained from this phase I/II trial would represent the first milestone in the clinical evaluation of a novel immunotherapeutic concept for treatment-resistant low- and high-grade lymphoma and NHL patients in relapse.

One case received unrelated HLA 5/6 loci matched umbilical cord blood HSCT. The children received immunosuppressive therapy after III-IV aGVHD occurring. They received 0.5x10(6)/kg hUCMSC infusion when conventional therapy was ineffective. The results showed that 5 cases of children acute leukemia achieved hematopoietic reconstitution and developed the III-IV grade aGVHD. The five cases of children were infused with hUCMSC. The rash subsided, the liver function was normalized and the gastrointestinal symptoms were improved. The infusion-related adverse reaction did not happen. At present, the 5 children are in remission. It is concluded that allogeneic HSCT is an effective therapeutic method for children with acute leukemia. HUCMSC infusion can be safely and effectively used for the treatment of refractory aGVHD.","['Qiao, Shu-Min', 'Chen, Guang-Hua', 'Wang, Yi', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Sun, Xu-Ding', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Qiao SM', 'Chen GH', 'Wang Y', 'Hu SY', 'Sun XD', 'Wu DP']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0716-05 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):716-20. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CB6F1 female mouse was served as recipient and C57BL/6 male mouse was served as donor. Each CB6F1 female mouse was subjected to intravenous transfusion with 1x10(6) erythroleukemia (EL9611) cells at day 4 before transplantation, followed with intraperitoneal injection of Ara-C (0.015 g) respectively at day 2 and day 1, then conditioned for BMT with TBI (450 cGy) at day 1 before transplantation. After conditioning (day 0), each of recipients was transplanted with 6x10(7) mixture of bone marrow and spleen cells from the C57BL/6 mice, and was infused with 6 x 10(7) immunized donor lymphocytes at day 15 after transplantation. All treated animals were evaluated for survival, development of leukemia and aGVHD.

The results showed tht all mice with only inoculation of 10(6) EL9611 cells survived for 15 +/- 1 days (n = 4); all mice of other groups obtained the varying degrees of implantation. SRY could be detected at day 30 and 60 after transplantation. The chimerism of donor CD3(+) cells in mixed bone marrow transplantation (MT) group at day 14, 30 and 60 respectively reached 17.95% +/- 12.03%, 37.34% +/- 2.78% and 47.06% +/- 6.1%.

Twenty-two patients with high-risk and refractory AML receive URD-HSCT were enrolled in this study. All the patients received myeloablative preconditioning regimen consisting of busulfan/cyclophosphamide (for 20 cases) or total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide (for 2 cases) before URD-HSCT. The cyclosporin A (CsA)/MTX/MMF/ATG were used to prevent the acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). The results showed that 21 out of 22 patients acquired engraftment with implantation rate 95.5%. The median time of ANC >/= 0.5x10(9)/L was 12 (10-19) days, and that of Plt >/= 20x10(9)/L was 14 (5 - 22) days. The median follow-up time post transplantation was 18 (3 to 135.5) months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were (53.9 +/- 12.2) % and (49.1 +/- 10.7)% respectively. Eight cases developed aGVHD. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD was (39.1 +/- 10.6) %. Six patients developed I-II grade of aGVHD and two patients developed III-IV grade of aGVHD. The chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) was occurred in 6 patients (4 patients limited, 2 patients extensive) of the 19 evaluable patients. The cumulative incidence was (28.8 +/- 9.6)%. Seven cases relapsed, and the cumulative response rate of 2 years was (35.8 +/- 11) %. One of 9 patients died from sepsis before hematopoietic reconstruction, one died from lung infection, Six died from relapse and one relapsed patient died from IV grade of aGVHD post chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). The univariate analysis revealed that relapse was the major factor for the OS, and the sex, age, preconditioning regimen, aGVHD and infection didn't significantly influence the efficacy of URD-HSCT. The survival of patients with cGVHD was superior to those who didn't have cGVHD (83.3% vs 37%, P = 0.152). It is concluded that URD-HSCT is a safe and effective therapy for high-risk AML patients without related donor. Notably, patients with cGVHD had a better survival. Relapse is an unfavourable factor for the efficacy of URD-HSCT and adoptive immunotherapy such as DLI can prevent it and improve the prognosis to achieve the long-time survival.","['Ye, Fan', 'Tang, Xiao-Wen', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Qiu, Hiu-Ying', 'Jin, Zheng-Ming', 'Fu, Zheng-Zheng', 'Chen, Feng', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Ye F', 'Tang XW', 'Sun AN', 'Qiu HY', 'Jin ZM', 'Fu ZZ', 'Chen F', 'Wu DP']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0696-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):696-701. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of SHP-1 and C-kit mRNA in drug-treated cell group and control group. The methylation specific PCR (MSP) was applied to measure the methylation status of SHP-1 gene in HL-60 cells. The results showed that after being treated with As2O3 the recovery of SHP-1 gene expression was observed in HL-60 cells in which SHP-1 mRNA originally did not expressed, meanwhile the expression level of C-kit mRNA in HL-60 cells with high expression decreased. When HL-60 cells were treated with As2O3 of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 micromol/L, the demethylation effects was enhanced, the expression of SHP-1 mRNA displayed an ascending tendency, and expression of C-kit mRNA showed an descending tendency in dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the absence of SHP-1 mRNA expression in HL-60 cells and recovery of expression after treatment with As2O3 suggest the hypermethylation of SHP-1 gene related with pathogenesis of leukemia, and the abnormal increase of C-kit mRNA expression maybe exist in formation of leukemia. The effect of As2O3 on expression of SHP-1 and C-kit shows dose-dependency, the higher the As2O3 concentration, the higher the SHP-1 expression and the lower the C-kit expression, moreover, the effect of As2O3 shows time-dependency in specific concentration. The SHP-1 mRNA expression negatively relates with C-kit mRNA expression, suggesting that the decrease or absence of SHP-1 expression in leukemia cells weakens the negative regulation on C-kit signaling pathway, thus plays a role in the formation of leukemia.","['Meng, Zhen', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Li, Ying-Hua', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Guo, Su-Qing', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Meng Z', 'Wang DM', 'Li YH', 'Liu X', 'Guo SQ', 'Luo JM']","['Department of Hemotology, Hengshui Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hebei Province, China. mengzhen1978@163.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0613-04 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):613-6. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed to screen 192 AML patients for exon 4 of the IDH2 gene. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, c-kit and WT1 mutations were also included in analysis. The results showed that IDH2 mutation was found in 14 (7.29%) of 192 patients. There were 9 AML patients with R140Q mutation, 1 patient with R140W mutation, and 1 patient with R172K mutation. IDH2 aberrations significantly more were detected in French-American-British (FAB) M5 (P < 0.005) than other types. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, WBC, platelet count, bone marrow blasts count, hemoglobin as compared with IDH2 wild-type.

Genomic DNA from 78 newly diagnosed AML from August 2010 to October 2012 was screened by PCR and sequencing or capillary electrophoresis (CE) for NPM1, FLT3 and c-KIT mutations. The results showed that the incidence of NPM1 mutation was 14.1% in AML patients and 26.7% in normal karyotype AML patients. NPM1 mutant cases were significantly associated with old age (P < 0.05), high peripheral white cell count and platelet counts (P < 0.05) and low expression of CD34 (P < 0.05), but no statistic difference was found in sex, percentage of bone marrow blasts, Hb, expression of CD117 and HLA-DR, complete remission rate, overall survival and relapse rate (P > 0.05). The prevalences of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations were 11.5% (9/78) and 3.8% (3/78) respectively, and no one patient has both of the two mutations. Patients with FLT3-ITD mutation had higher white blood cell counts and percentage of in bone marrow blasts (P < 0.05), and lower overall survival (P < 0.05), more relative to normal karyotype (P < 0.05), while no statistic difference was found in sex, age, platelet count, Hb level, complete remission rate and relapse rate (P > 0.05). No statistic analysis was performed due to the cases of less FLT3-TKD mutation. C-KIT mutation accounts for 7.7% (6/78). Patients with C-KIT mutation had a higher percentage in abnormal karyotype (P < 0.05), and higher relapse rate (P < 0.05), and lower overall survival, whereas no statistic difference was found in sex, age, percentage of bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood cell count, complete remission rate (P > 0.05).

Their overall survival and tolerance were evaluated. The results showed that the median duration of dasatinib therapy was 8 (1-66) months in the 27 imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL positive leukemia cases, with a median follow-up of 54 (3-75) months. After the dasatinib treatment, 88.8% of all the 27 cases achieved complete hematologic response (CHR), 29.6% of them achieved major cytogenetic response (mCyR), 37% of all achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and 18.5% cases achieved major molecular response (MMR). Patients who received dasatinib in progress of disease (CML-AP, CML-BC and bone marrow relapse Ph(+) ALL) had a lower CCyR rate than those in stable disease (CML-CP and bone marrow remission Ph(+) ALL) (P = 0.0377), and 3 - 4 grade adverse events occurred more frequently in progress of disease than that in stable disease. Overall survival of the patients who achieved CCyR after dasatinib therapy was statistically longer than those who did not achieve CCyR (63 m vs 9 m, P = 0.0126).

Fifty-one acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal karyotype from January 2009 to December 2011 were enrolled in this study. The clinical data of 51 cases were analyzed retrospectively. Out of 52 cases 22 were male, and 29 were female. The median age was 47 years old (ranged from 14 to 83 years old). The de novo patients were examined by bone marrow cytomorphology and blood routine analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations. The results showed that the patients with NPM1 mutations had higher leukocyte count compared with those without mutations (30.7x10(9)/L vs 8.6x10(9)/L, P = 0.002). FLT3-ITD mutation was related to higher leukocyte count (42.38x10(9)/L vs 11.45x10(9)/L without mutation, P = 0.033) and blasts (74.0% vs 60.25% without mutation, P = 0.036). The leukocyte count and percentage of bone marrow blasts were lowest in the patients with neither mutations, and gradually increasing in the NPM1(-) mutation, FLT3-ITD(-) mutation, and NPM1(+) mutation, FLT3-ITDI(+) mutation, and NPM1(+)/FLT3-ITD(+) mutation groups (P < 0.05).

The inhibition of AATF mRNA and protein expression was respectively detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that RNAi eukaryotic expression vectors targeting AATF had correct reading frame and nucleotide sequence. Real-time PCR revealed that AATF shRNA effectively silenced mRNA expression of AATF. Western blot analysis found that AATF shRNA obviously suppressed protein expression of AATF (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the shRNA eukaryotic expression vector has been successfully constructed which can inhibit the expression of AATF, and the establishment of stably transfected U937 cell lines provide a original route for exploring the mechanism of AATF in human Leukemia further.","['Lyu, Chao', 'Cao, Jiang', 'Meng, Fan-Jing', 'Zeng, Ling-Yu', 'Pan, Bin', 'Chen, Chong', 'Wu, Qing-Yun', 'Song, Xu-Guang', 'Li, Zhen-Yu', 'Pan, Xiu-Ying', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Lyu C', 'Cao J', 'Meng FJ', 'Zeng LY', 'Pan B', 'Chen C', 'Wu QY', 'Song XG', 'Li ZY', 'Pan XY', 'Xu KL']","['Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (AATF protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Plasmids', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', '*RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0567-04 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):567-70. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The smears of BM and PB were collected from 68 out-patients and inpatients including 28 cases of HLA and 40 cases of non HAL (NHAL) in our hospital since 2009. The proliferation degree, morphology and abnormal appearance in each cell lineage were observed with HE, POX, PAS, NSE+ NaF staining for BM mears and HE staining for PB smears by means of optical microscope. The final diagnosis was made by cellular chemical staining results, then the counting and classification were performed in 200 nucleated cells to calculate the percentage of each cell lineage, the myeloid/erythroid ratio and so on. The BP smears were observed with the same methods, the counting and classification of 100 nucleated cells were performed to calculate a variety of nucleated cell percentage. The resulted data were analyzed by the SPSS 12.0 statistical software, the difference of proliferation degree and ratio of each cell lineage in BM smears were compared, the relationship of morphological features of PB smears with BM smears was analyzed. The results showed that obvious or extreme active proliferation of nucleated cells was observed in HAL and NHAL groups, but the myeloproliferation in HAL group was more active than that in NHAL group (P < 0.05). The erythrocyte and megakaryocyte lineages were suppressed in both groups, while the HAL group showed a lower proportion of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte lineages in BM as compared with NHAL group (P < 0.05). The hemoglobin and platelet levels in PB of HAL group were obviously lower than those in PB of NHAL group (P < 0.05). The leukemia cells could be seen in PB smears of NHAL, but the proportion of leukemia cells in NHAL group was smaller than that in HAL group (P < 0.05). The leukocyte count in PB of HAL group strongly positively correlated with the proliferation degree of leukemia cells in BM of HAL group (r = 0.422). It is concluded that the significant difference of proliferation degree, cell levels and blast ratio in BM and PB exists in HAL and NHAL groups, moreover the leukemia cells ratio, leukocyte, hemoglobin and platelet levels in PB of HAL all show characteristic changes. Therefore the contrast analysis of characteristic changes from laboratorial detection contributes to grasp the regular pattern of HAL, meanwhile has an important value for guiding correct diagnosis of acute leukemia and choosing suitable treatment options.","['Liu, Ya-Lin', 'Liu, Hai-Bo', 'Wang, Wen-Juan', 'Ma, Le', 'Wang, Xiao-Ning', 'Liu, Hua-Sheng']","['Liu YL', 'Liu HB', 'Wang WJ', 'Ma L', 'Wang XN', 'Liu HS']","[""Department of Hematological Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0562-05 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):562-6. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNA-223 mimics was transfected to increase the expression of MicroRNA-223 in the lymphocytes sorted by ficoll separation from the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of ALL and CLL patients. MicroRNA-223 inhibitor was transfected to decrease the expression of the MicroRNA-223 in the lymphocytes of normal controls. Then the expression of the MicroRNA-223 and LMO2 in transfected lymphocytes before and after cultivating for 72 hours were detected by RT-PCR, the apoptosis and cell cycle of these cells were measured by flow cytometery.

There are putative binding sites of transcription factor GATA-2 upstream of iASPP transcription start site. GATA-2 plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. This study was aimed to explore the role of GATA-2 protein in iASPP gene transcription. Firstly, the expression of iASPP and GATA-2 protein in some leukemia cell lines was detected by Western blot. Second, The expressive vector of pCMV5-GATA2 and the luciferase reporter vectors containing possible binding sites of GATA-2 were constructed and co-transfected into HEK293 and CV-1 cells. Then the luciferase activity was assayed by luminometer. Also, ChIP assays were performed to further confirm the specific binding of GATA-2 to iASPP promoter. The results showed that GATA-2 was overexpressed in most cell lines with high level of iASPP. GATA-2 exhibited a significant effect on luciferase activity of reporter gene iASPP and in a dose-dependant manner. The relative luciferase activity was up-regulated to about two-fold of the empty vector control when the transfection dose of pCMV5-GATA2 plasmid was increased to 100 ng. While the effect was more significant in CV-1 cells and showed a 6.7-fold increase. The ChIP assay demonstrated the in vivo specific binding of GATA-2 to iASPP. The binding sites of GATA2 were located between nt -361 approximately -334 in upstream of iASPP gene transcription start site. It is concluded that transcription factor GATA-2 can bind with the cis-regulatory region of the iASPP promoter and up-regulate iASPP expression.","['Xing, Hai-Yan', 'Jia, Yu-Jiao', 'Tang, Ke-Jing', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Chen, Yi-Rui', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang']","['Xing HY', 'Jia YJ', 'Tang KJ', 'Tian Z', 'Chen YR', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang JX']","['Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (PPP1R13L protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/07/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137 (2013)03-0550-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;21(3):550-5. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.03.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overlap PCR was used to construct the dual expression vectors encoding wide type or N187D mutant type P2X7 receptor and ICN1 linked by the self-cleaving 2A sequence. The results showed that stable expressing cell lines were obtained by retroviral infection followed by cell sorting after DNA sequence analysis.

DNA sequence analysis revealed that all construction were right. The infection efficiency of packaged constructed virus ranged from 40% to 70% for K562 cells. Stable infected cell line was obtained by cell sorting. RT-PCR analysis revealed that P2X7 receptor and/or ICN1 could be detected at high level in their stable infected cell lines, respectively.

Occasionally, circulating blasts in the peripheral blood are rare ({less than or equal to}1%) and may be missed, even when flow cytometric immunophenotyping is performed, leading to a false negative report. Methods: The records from all patients with a new diagnosis of B-LL at our institution were reviewed from Jan 2009-Dec 2011. Of 130 cases with peripheral blood flow cytometry, 15 had a blast count of {less than or equal to}1%, with 14 having electronic files for gating monocytes. The percentage of monocytes by flow cytometry and absolute monocyte counts (AMCs) were compared with peripheral blood samples that were negative by flow cytometry, sent due to at least one lineage cytopenia (n=39). Results: The monocytes from the patients with leukemia averaged 0.8%, and were statistically lower than the negative controls, which averaged 7.1% (p<0.001). 11 of the 14 (79%) patients with leukemia had monocytes <1%, compared to only 3 (8%) of the negative controls. The AMCs were also significantly lower (p<0.001), with 93% of the leukemia group having an AMC of <100 cells/microL, compared to only 28% of the negative controls. Conclusions: In patients presenting with cytopenias, assessment of percentage monocytes may be an important diagnostic clue in determining the presence of occult leukemia.

Its role as proto-oncogene is based on several Pim-1 target proteins involved in pivotal cellular processes. Here, we explore the functional relevance of Pim-1 in colon carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNAi-based knockdown approaches, as well as a specific small molecule inhibitor, were used to inhibit Pim-1 in colon carcinoma cells. The effects were analyzed regarding proliferation, apoptosis, sensitization toward cytostatic treatment, and overall antitumor effect in vitro and in mouse tumor models in vivo. RESULTS: We demonstrate antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and overall antitumor effects of Pim-1 inhibition. The sensitization to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment upon Pim-1 knockdown offers new possibilities for combinatorial treatment approaches. Importantly, this also antagonizes a 5-FU-triggered Pim-1 up-regulation, which is mediated by decreased levels of miR-15b, a microRNA we newly identify to regulate Pim-1. The analysis of the molecular effects of Pim-1 inhibition reveals a complex regulatory network, with therapeutic Pim-1 repression leading to major changes in oncogenic signal transduction with regard to p21(Cip1/WAF1), STAT3, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), c-Myc, and survivin and in the levels of apoptosis-related proteins Puma, Bax, and Bcl-xL. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Pim-1 plays a pivotal role in several tumor-relevant signaling pathways and establish the functional relevance of Pim-1 in colon carcinoma. Our results also substantiate the RNAi-mediated Pim-1 knockdown based on polymeric polyethylenimine/small interfering RNA nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic approach.","['Weirauch, Ulrike', 'Beckmann, Nadine', 'Thomas, Maren', 'Grunweller, Arnold', 'Huber, Kilian', 'Bracher, Franz', 'Hartmann, Roland K', 'Aigner, Achim']","['Weirauch U', 'Beckmann N', 'Thomas M', 'Grunweller A', 'Huber K', 'Bracher F', 'Hartmann RK', 'Aigner A']","['Rudolf Boehm Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3689241,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.13172 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2013 Jul;15(7):783-94. doi: 10.1593/neo.13172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, therapy resistance in patients with MDS/AML remains a challenging issue. Membrane proteins that are involved in drug uptake are potential mediators of drug resistance. The responsible proteins for the transport of 5-azacytidine into MDS/AML cells are unknown. We have now systematically analyzed the expression and activity of various nucleoside transporters. We identified the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) as the most abundant nucleoside transporter in leukemia cell lines and in AML patient samples. Transport assays using [(1)(4)C]5-azacytidine demonstrated Na(+)-independent uptake of the drug into the cells, which was inhibited by S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI), a hENT1 inhibitor. The cellular toxicity of 5-azacytidine and its DNA demethylating activity were strongly reduced after hENT1 inhibition. In contrast, the cellular activity of the 5-azacytidine derivative 5-azacytidine-5'-elaidate (CP-4200), a nucleoside transporter-independent drug, persisted after hENT1 inhibition. A strong dependence of 5-azacytidine-induced DNA demethylation on hENT1 activity was also confirmed by array-based DNA methylation profiling, which uncovered hundreds of loci that became demethylated only when hENT1-mediated transport was active. Our data establish hENT1 as a key transporter for the cellular uptake of 5-azacytidine in leukemia cells and raise the possibility that hENT1 expression might be a useful biomarker to predict the efficiency of 5-azacytidine treatments. Furthermore, our data suggest that CP-4200 may represent a valuable compound for the modulation of transporter-related 5-azacytidine resistances.","['Hummel-Eisenbeiss, Johanna', 'Hascher, Antje', 'Hals, Petter-Arnt', 'Sandvold, Marit Liland', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Lyko, Frank', 'Rius, Maria']","['Hummel-Eisenbeiss J', 'Hascher A', 'Hals PA', 'Sandvold ML', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Lyko F', 'Rius M']","['Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CP 4200)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.113.086801 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.113.086801 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Sep;84(3):438-50. doi: 10.1124/mol.113.086801.

During GVHD, donor T cells are activated by host antigen-presenting cells and differentiate into T-effector cells (Teffs) that migrate to GVHD target organs. However, local environmental factors influencing Teff differentiation and migration are largely unknown. Vitamin A metabolism within the intestine produces retinoic acid, which contributes to intestinal homeostasis and tolerance induction. Here, we show that the expression and function of vitamin A-metabolizing enzymes were increased in the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes in mice with active GVHD. Moreover, transgenic donor T cells expressing a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) response element luciferase reporter responded to increased vitamin A metabolites in GVHD-affected organs. Increasing RAR signaling accelerated GVHD lethality, whereas donor T cells expressing a dominant-negative RARalpha (dnRARalpha) showed markedly diminished lethality. The dnRARalpha transgenic T cells showed reduced Th1 differentiation and alpha4beta7 and CCR9 expression associated with poor intestinal migration, low GVHD pathology, and reduced intestinal permeability, primarily via CD4(+) T cells. The inhibition of RAR signaling augmented donor-induced Treg generation and expansion in vivo, while preserving graft-versus-leukemia effects. Together, these results suggested that reagents blunting donor T-cell RAR signaling may possess therapeutic anti-GVHD properties.","['Aoyama, Kazutoshi', 'Saha, Asim', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Riddle, Megan J', 'Veenstra, Rachelle G', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Blomhoff, Rune', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Klebanoff, Christopher A', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Munn, David H', 'Murphy, William J', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Fulton, Leshara M', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Chandraratna, Roshantha A', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan', 'Guo, Yanxia', 'Noelle, Randolph J', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Aoyama K', 'Saha A', 'Tolar J', 'Riddle MJ', 'Veenstra RG', 'Taylor PA', 'Blomhoff R', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Klebanoff CA', 'Socie G', 'Munn DH', 'Murphy WJ', 'Serody JS', 'Fulton LM', 'Teshima T', 'Chandraratna RA', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Guo Y', 'Noelle RJ', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, MN;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Intestines/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology']",PMC3778553,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)43151-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-470252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Sep 19;122(12):2125-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-470252.

However, their mechanism of action is not well understood, and resistance to GCs is inevitable. In a minimal, serum-free culture system, the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) was found to decrease the metabolic activity of CLL cells, indicated by down-regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression and activity, decreased levels of pyruvate and its metabolites, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This metabolic restriction was associated with decreased size and death of some of the tumor cells in the population. Concomitant plasma membrane damage increased killing of CLL cells by DEX. However, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), which regulates fatty acid oxidation, was also increased by DEX, and adipocyte-derived lipids, lipoproteins, and propionic acid protected CLL cells from DEX. PPARalpha and fatty acid oxidation enzyme inhibitors increased DEX-mediated killing of CLL cells in vitro and clearance of CLL xenografts in vivo. These findings suggest that GCs prevent tumor cells from generating the energy needed to repair membrane damage, fatty acid oxidation is a mechanism of resistance to GC-mediated cytotoxicity, and PPARalpha inhibition is a strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GCs.","['Tung, Stephanie', 'Shi, Yonghong', 'Wong, Karry', 'Zhu, Fang', 'Gorczynski, Reg', 'Laister, Robert C', 'Minden, Mark', 'Blechert, Anne-Kareen', 'Genzel, Yvonne', 'Reichl, Udo', 'Spaner, David E']","['Tung S', 'Shi Y', 'Wong K', 'Zhu F', 'Gorczynski R', 'Laister RC', 'Minden M', 'Blechert AK', 'Genzel Y', 'Reichl U', 'Spaner DE']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, 2075 Bayview Ave., Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '0 (thyroid hormone-binding proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'JHU490RVYR (propionic acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'PPAR alpha/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Propionates/chemistry', 'Thyroid Hormones/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56003-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-489468 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 8;122(6):969-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-489468.

Telomerase-negative cancer cells, by contrast, often employ the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway to maintain telomeres. ALT cells are characterized by long and dynamic telomeres and the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs). Previous work has shown the importance of APBs to the ALT pathway, but their formation and precise role remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a homeobox-containing protein known as HMBOX1 can directly bind telomeric double-stranded DNA and associate with PML nuclear bodies. Hence, we renamed this protein TAH1 for telomere-associated homeobox-containing protein 1. TAH1 knockdown significantly reduced the number of APBs and led to an increase in DNA damage response signals at telomeres. Importantly, TAH1 inhibition also notably reduced the presence of telomere C-circles, indicating altered ALT activity. Our findings point to TAH1 as a novel link between pathways that regulate DNA damage responses, PML nuclear bodies, and telomere homeostasis in ALT cells, and provide insight into how ALT cells may achieve sustained growth and proliferation independent of the telomerase.","['Feng, Xuyang', 'Luo, Zhenhua', 'Jiang, Shuai', 'Li, Feng', 'Han, Xin', 'Hu, Yang', 'Wang, Dan', 'Zhao, Yong', 'Ma, Wenbin', 'Liu, Dan', 'Huang, Junjiu', 'Songyang, Zhou']","['Feng X', 'Luo Z', 'Jiang S', 'Li F', 'Han X', 'Hu Y', 'Wang D', 'Zhao Y', 'Ma W', 'Liu D', 'Huang J', 'Songyang Z']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (HMBOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics']",PMC3757334,['NOTNLM'],"['ALT pathway', 'Alternative lengthening of telomeres', 'DNA damage response', 'HMBOX1', 'Homeobox', 'TAH1', 'Telomere']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.128512 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.128512 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Sep 1;126(Pt 17):3982-9. doi: 10.1242/jcs.128512.

High levels of Hck are associated with drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, Hck activity has been connected with HIV-1. Herein, structure-based drug design efforts were aimed at identifying novel Hck inhibitors. First, an in-house library of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives, which were previously shown to be dual Abl and c-Src inhibitors, was analyzed by docking studies within the ATP binding site of Hck to select the best candidates to be tested in a cell-free assay. Next, the same computational protocol was applied to screen a database of commercially available compounds. As a result, most of the selected compounds were found active against Hck, with Ki values ranging from 0.14 to 18.4 muM, confirming the suitability of the computational approach adopted. Furthermore, selected compounds showed an interesting antiproliferative activity profile against the human leukemia cell line KU-812, and one compound was found to block HIV-1 replication at sub-toxic concentrations.","['Tintori, Cristina', 'Laurenzana, Ilaria', 'La Rocca, Francesco', 'Falchi, Federico', 'Carraro, Fabio', 'Ruiz, Alba', 'Este, Jose A', 'Kissova, Miroslava', 'Crespan, Emmanuele', 'Maga, Giovanni', 'Biava, Mariangela', 'Brullo, Chiara', 'Schenone, Silvia', 'Botta, Maurizio']","['Tintori C', 'Laurenzana I', 'La Rocca F', 'Falchi F', 'Carraro F', 'Ruiz A', 'Este JA', 'Kissova M', 'Crespan E', 'Maga G', 'Biava M', 'Brullo C', 'Schenone S', 'Botta M']","['Dipartimento Biotecnologie, Chimica e Farmacia, Universita degli Studi di Siena, Via A.

The ABCD recognises that there is a wide variation in the design and management of shelters, and that these largely reflect local pressures. These guidelines are written with this diverse audience in mind; they point to the ideal, and also provide for some level of compromise where this ideal cannot immediately be attained. In addition consideration should be given to general requirements in order to optimise overall health and wellbeing of cats within the shelter. HOUSING: Compartmentalisation of the shelter into at least three individual sections (quarantine area for incoming cats, isolation facilities for sick or potentially infectious cats, and accommodation for clinically healthy, retrovirus-negative cats) can facilitate containment of a disease outbreak, should it occur. STANDARD OF CARE: Incoming cats should receive a full health check by a veterinary surgeon, should be dewormed and tested for retrovirus infections (feline leukaemia virus [FeLV] and/or feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV]) in regions with high prevalence and in shelters that allow contact between cats. Cats which are not rehomed should receive a regular veterinary check-up at intervals recommended by their veterinarian. VACCINATION: Each cat should be vaccinated as soon as possible against feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) infections. HYGIENE: Adequate hygiene conditions should ensure that contact between shedders of infectious agents and susceptible animals is reduced as efficiently as possible by movement control, hygiene procedures of care workers, barrier nursing, cleaning and disinfection. STRESS REDUCTION: Stress reduction is important for overall health and for minimising the risk of recrudescence and exacerbation of infectious diseases. In general, a special effort should be made to rehome cats as soon as possible.","['Mostl, Karin', 'Egberink, Herman', 'Addie, Diane', 'Frymus, Tadeusz', 'Boucraut-Baralon, Corine', 'Truyen, Uwe', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Gruffydd-Jones, Tim', 'Radford, Alan D', 'Lloret, Albert', 'Pennisi, Maria Grazia', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Marsilio, Fulvio', 'Thiry, Etienne', 'Belak, Sandor', 'Horzinek, Marian C']","['Mostl K', 'Egberink H', 'Addie D', 'Frymus T', 'Boucraut-Baralon C', 'Truyen U', 'Hartmann K', 'Lutz H', 'Gruffydd-Jones T', 'Radford AD', 'Lloret A', 'Pennisi MG', 'Hosie MJ', 'Marsilio F', 'Thiry E', 'Belak S', 'Horzinek MC']",['European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases. karin.moestl@vu-wien.ac.at'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Animal Husbandry/methods/*standards', '*Animal Welfare/standards', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Cats', 'Communicable Diseases/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Housing, Animal/*standards', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Quarantine', 'Zoonoses']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['15/7/546 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X13489210 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2013 Jul;15(7):546-54. doi: 10.1177/1098612X13489210.,"['BB/D008425/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,['J Feline Med Surg. 2013 Sep;15(9):829-30.

Thus, in the present study, the molecular mechanism of autophagic cell death by Tan IIA was investigated in KBM-5 leukemia cells. Tan IIA significantly increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) II as a hallmark of autophagy in western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Tan IIA augmented the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and attenuated the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6K in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partly reversed the cytotoxicity and the phosphorylation of AMPK, mTOR and p70 S6K induced by Tan IIA in KBM-5 leukemia cells. In addition, Tan IIA dramatically activated the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway including Raf, ERK and p90 RSK in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Consistently, ERK inhibitor PD184352 suppressed LC3-II activation induced by Tan IIA, whereas PD184352 and PD98059 did not affect poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and sub-G1 accumulation induced by Tan IIA in KBM-5 leukemia cells. Furthermore, Tan IIA could induce autophagy via LC3-II activation in various cancer cells such as prostate (PC-3), multiple myeloma (U266), lung (NCI-H460), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cells. Overall, these findings suggest that Tan IIA induces autophagic cell death via activation of AMPK and ERK and inhibition of mTOR and p70 S6K in KBM-5 cells as a potent natural compound for leukemia treatment.","['Yun, Sun-Mi', 'Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Sohn, Eun Jung', 'Kim, Bonglee', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Yun SM', 'Jung JH', 'Jeong SJ', 'Sohn EJ', 'Kim B', 'Kim SH']","['Cancer Preventive Material Development Research Center, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Abietanes)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AMPK', 'ERK', 'LC3 II', 'autophagy', 'mTOR', 'p70 S6K', 'tanshinone IIA']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/27 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5015 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2014 Mar;28(3):458-64. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5015.

The replacement of fetal bovine serum with knockout serum replacement (KSR) did not significantly reduce follicle growth or oocyte maturation in vitro, although it significantly reduced the development of oocytes after activation. Regardless of the replacement medium, follicle growth was not influenced by the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The addition of 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF) to the KSR-supplemented serum-free medium significantly stimulated follicle development, which further improved blastocyst formation after oocyte activation. On Day 3 of culture, a significant increase in Bmp7 expression was detected in the SCF-containing medium compared with the serum-containing medium, whereas Gdf9 and Amh were increased in the serum-containing medium. A significant increase in estradiol production was detected under serum-free conditions, but minimal progesterone secretion was detected throughout the culture period. In conclusion, serum-free media can be used to optimize ovarian follicle cultures, and the addition of SCF is beneficial for deriving developmentally competent oocytes through follicle culture.","['Park, Young Hyun', 'Gong, Seung Pyo', 'Kim, Hwa Young', 'Kim, Gil Ah', 'Choi, Jun Hee', 'Ahn, Ji Yeon', 'Lim, Jeong Mook']","['Park YH', 'Gong SP', 'Kim HY', 'Kim GA', 'Choi JH', 'Ahn JY', 'Lim JM']","['Stem Cell and Bioevaluation, WCU Biomodulation Program, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (bmp7 protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*chemistry', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Follicle/cytology/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrd.22204 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2013 Sep;80(9):725-33. doi: 10.1002/mrd.22204.

RUNX1 and CBFbeta are the most common targets of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia. CBF has been implicated in other cancer types; for example RUNX1 and RUNX2 are implicated in cancers of epithelial origin, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. In these tumors, CBF is involved in maintaining the malignant phenotype and, when highly over-expressed, contributes to metastatic growth in bone. Herein, lentiviral delivery of CBFbeta-specific shRNAs was used to achieve a 95% reduction of CBFbeta in an ovarian cancer cell line. This drastic reduction in CBFbeta expression resulted in growth inhibition that was not associated with a cell cycle block or an increase in apoptosis. However, CBFbeta silencing resulted in increased autophagy and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since sphingolipid and ceramide metabolism regulates non-apoptotic cell death, autophagy, and ROS production, fumonsin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, was used to alter ceramide production in the CBFbeta-silenced cells. FB1 treatment inhibited the CBFbeta-dependent increase in autophagy and provided a modest increase in cell survival. To document alterations to sphingolipids in the CBFbeta-silenced cells, ceramide, and lactosylceramide levels were directly examined by mass spectrometry. Substantial increases in ceramide species and decreases in lactosylceramides were identified. Altogether, this report provides evidence that CBF transcriptional pathways control cellular survival, at least in part, through sphingolipid metabolism.","['Greer, Adam H', 'Yong, Thomas', 'Fennell, Katie', 'Moustafa, Yara W', 'Fowler, Marcie', 'Galiano, Floyd', 'Ng, Shu-Wing', 'Berkowitz, Ross S', 'Cardelli, James', 'Meyers, Shari', 'Davis, J Nathan']","['Greer AH', 'Yong T', 'Fennell K', 'Moustafa YW', 'Fowler M', 'Galiano F', 'Ng SW', 'Berkowitz RS', 'Cardelli J', 'Meyers S', 'Davis JN']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSUHSC School of Medicine in Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lactosylceramides)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '4682-48-8 (CDw17 antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Autophagy/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactosylceramides/genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/15 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24406 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2013 Dec;228(12):2350-64. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24406.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

It therefore represents a challenging disease for T-cell immunotherapeutics. The CD19/CD3 bi-specific antibody construct blinatumomab (AMG103 or MT103) has been tested clinically in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia but has not been assessed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We investigated whether blinatumomab could overcome T-cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in vitro. Blinatumomab was tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 28 patients (treatment naive and previously treated). T-cell activation and function, as well as cytotoxicity against leukemic tumor cells were measured. Blinatumomab induced T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion and granzyme B release in a manner similar to that occurring with stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads. However, only blinatumomab was able to induce tumor cell death and this was found to require blinatumomab-mediated conjugate formation between T cells and tumor cells. Cytotoxicity of tumor cells was observed at very low T-cell:tumor cell ratios. A three-dimensional model based on confocal microscopy suggested that up to 11 tumor cells could cluster round each T cell. Importantly, blinatumomab induced cytotoxicity against tumor cells in samples from both treatment-naive and treated patients, and in the presence of co-culture pro-survival signals. The potent cytotoxic action of blinatumomab on tumor cells appears to involve conjugation of T cells with tumor cells at both the activation and effector stages. The efficacy of blinatumomab in vitro suggests that the bi-specific antibody approach may be a powerful immunotherapeutic strategy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Wong, Ryan', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Nagorsen, Dirk', 'Man, Stephen', 'Fegan, Chris']","['Wong R', 'Pepper C', 'Brennan P', 'Nagorsen D', 'Man S', 'Fegan C']",['mans@cf.ac.uk.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology']",PMC3857012,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.082248 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.082248 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Dec;98(12):1930-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.082248.

Using western blotting, we assessed the expression of wild-type survivin and survivin splice variants 2B and Delta-Ex3 in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts in samples taken from 105 patients at the time of their diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Given that survivin is a downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, survivin expression was also correlated with pSer473-Akt. Wild-type survivin and the 2B splice variant were positive in 76.3% and 78.0% of samples in the nucleus, cytoplasm or both, whereas the Delta-Ex3 isoform was only positive in the nucleus in 37.7% of samples. Cytoplasmic localization of wild-type survivin was significantly associated with the presence of high levels of pSer473-Akt (P<0.001). Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway with wortmannin and Ly294002 caused a significant reduction in the expression of cytoplasmic wild-type survivin. The presence of cytoplasmic wild-type survivin and pSer473-Akt was associated with a lower fraction of quiescent leukemia stem cells (P=0.02).

In this study, we demonstrated that the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 was down-regulated in the vast majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia whereas its expression was high in lymphoblastic cells. Correct function of the spindle assembly checkpoint is pivotal in mediating mitotic delay in response to spindle poisons. Mitotic delay by the spindle assembly checkpoint is achieved by inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex-dependent proteolysis of cyclin B and securin. We demonstrated a link between the repression of the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 in acute myeloid leukemia and the limited response to spindle poison. In accordance with its established role as an anaphase-promoting complex-inhibitor, we found that repression of BubR1 was associated with enhanced anaphase-promoting complex activity and cyclin B and securin degradation, which leads to premature sister-chromatid separation and failure to sustain a mitotic arrest. This suggests that repression of BubR1 in acute myeloid leukemia renders the spindle assembly checkpoint-mediated inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex insufficient, which facilitates completion of mitosis in the presence of spindle poison. As both direct and BubR1-mediated restoration of cyclin B expression enhanced response to spindle poison, we propose that the downstream axis of the spindle assembly checkpoint is a promising target for tailored therapies for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Schnerch, Dominik', 'Schmidts, Andrea', 'Follo, Marie', 'Udi, Josefina', 'Felthaus, Julia', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Wasch, Ralph']","['Schnerch D', 'Schmidts A', 'Follo M', 'Udi J', 'Felthaus J', 'Pfeifer D', 'Engelhardt M', 'Wasch R']",['ralph.waesch@uniklinik-freiburg.de.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC3856964,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.087452 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.087452 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Dec;98(12):1886-95. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.087452.

However, there are major differences in the distribution of NHL subtypes between the pediatric and adult patient populations. At least for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) recent data indicate that patient age at diagnosis correlates with molecular features of the lymphoma. Concerning treatment, in common pediatric protocols the same therapy is used for DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL/B-AL). In adult patients, there is an established gold standard treatment for DLBCL, while the optimal treatment of BL/B-AL is under evaluation. Importantly, the correct diagnosis of the NHL subtype plays a crucial role in the treatment decision in adults with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Adolescent and young adult patients are caught between the two age groups of children on the one hand and adults on the other. Whether the lymphoma biology and subtypes found in this age group resemble rather their pediatric or their adult counterparts is not yet answered. Also, systematic data on the optimal treatment for adolescents with lymphoma are lacking. Therefore, this article reviews current data on patient characteristics, biology, treatment and outcome, mainly in pediatric patients. These data are compared to those published for adult patients with B-cell NHL aiming to look for hints on optimal classification and treatment in adolescents and young adults with B-NHL.","['Lange, Jonas', 'Burkhardt, Birgit']","['Lange J', 'Burkhardt B']","[""NHL-BFM Study Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-013-0166-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2013 Sep;8(3):226-35. doi: 10.1007/s11899-013-0166-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO, a fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia, is a transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation. AML1-ETO oligomerization, mediated by the NHR2 domain, is critical for leukaemogenesis, making it important to identify co-regulatory factors that 'read' the NHR2 oligomerization and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Here we show that, in human leukaemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC) that contains several haematopoietic transcription (co)factors. These AETFC components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, co-localize genome wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Within the AETFC complex, AML1-ETO oligomerization is required for a specific interaction between the oligomerized NHR2 domain and a novel NHR2-binding (N2B) motif in E proteins. Crystallographic analysis of the NHR2-N2B complex reveals a unique interaction pattern in which an N2B peptide makes direct contact with side chains of two NHR2 domains as a dimer, providing a novel model of how dimeric/oligomeric transcription factors create a new protein-binding interface through dimerization/oligomerization. Intriguingly, disruption of this interaction by point mutations abrogates AML1-ETO-induced haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and leukaemogenesis. These results reveal new mechanisms of action of AML1-ETO, and provide a potential therapeutic target in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Sun, Xiao-Jian', 'Wang, Zhanxin', 'Wang, Lan', 'Jiang, Yanwen', 'Kost, Nils', 'Soong, T David', 'Chen, Wei-Yi', 'Tang, Zhanyun', 'Nakadai, Tomoyoshi', 'Elemento, Olivier', 'Fischle, Wolfgang', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Patel, Dinshaw J', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Roeder, Robert G']","['Sun XJ', 'Wang Z', 'Wang L', 'Jiang Y', 'Kost N', 'Soong TD', 'Chen WY', 'Tang Z', 'Nakadai T', 'Elemento O', 'Fischle W', 'Melnick A', 'Patel DJ', 'Nimer SD', 'Roeder RG']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130630,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3732535,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/09/14 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['nature12287 [pii]', '10.1038/nature12287 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2013 Aug 1;500(7460):93-7. doi: 10.1038/nature12287.

This study evaluated the role of common germline genetic variation in CXCR5 in the risk and prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) using a clinic-based study of 1,521 controls and 2,694 NHL cases including 710 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 586 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 588 follicular lymphoma (FL), 137 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 230 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and 158 peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Of the ten CXCR5 tag SNPs in our study, five were associated with risk of NHL, with rs1790192 having the strongest association (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.30; p = 0.0003). This SNP was most strongly associated with the risk of FL (OR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.25-1.66; p = 3.1 x 10(-7)), with a lower degree of association with DLBCL (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33; p = 0.04) and PTCL (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.02-1.64; p = 0.04) but no association with the risk of MCL or MZL. For FL patients that were observed as initial disease management, the number of minor alleles of rs1790192 was associated with better event-free survival (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47-0.87; p = 0.004).

However, there are few studies investigating the cytogenetic profile and outcome of patients with a hyperdiploid karyotype (49-65 chromosomes, HK). We identified 221 (14%) patients with HK out of 1563 patients with three or more chromosomal abnormalities. HK was not associated with sex, white cell count and secondary disease status, but was more prevalent among children (22% vs 13%). The pattern of chromosomal gain and loss was non-random and chromosomes 8, 13 and 21 were the most frequently gained. Three distinct subgroups (numerical, structural and adverse) were identified with differential outcome: 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 52%, 68% and 76%, respectively (P=0.008). Patients in the adverse subgroup had poorer survival compared with patients with only numerical abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.01 (95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.83), P=0.0002).

The transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) is generally expressed in Tregs. Here, we identify and characterize spontaneous cytotoxic immune responses to Foxp3-expressing cells in peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and cancer patients. These immune responses were directed against a HLA-A2-restricted peptide epitope derived from Foxp3. Foxp3-reactive T cells were characterized as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These cells recognized dendritic cells incubated with recombinant Foxp3 protein indicating that this protein was indeed internalized, processed and cross-presented in the context of HLA-A2. More importantly, however, Foxp3-specific T cells were able to specifically recognize Tregs. Similarly, Foxp3+ malignant T cells established from a Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) patient were readily killed by the Foxp3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The spontaneous presence of Foxp3-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses suggest a general role of such T cells in the complex network of immune regulation as such responses may eliminate Tregs, that is, suppression of the suppressors. Consequently, induction of Foxp3-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses appears as an attractive tool to boost spontaneous or therapeutically provoked immune responses, for example, for the therapy of cancer.","['Larsen, S K', 'Munir, S', 'Woetmann, A', 'Frosig, T M', 'Odum, N', 'Svane, I M', 'Becker, J C', 'Andersen, M H']","['Larsen SK', 'Munir S', 'Woetmann A', 'Frosig TM', 'Odum N', 'Svane IM', 'Becker JC', 'Andersen MH']","['Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT), Department of Hematology, 54P4, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130701,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cross Reactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013196 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.196 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2332-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.196.

In the absence of HLA-matched donors, however, incidence of HSCT-related complications is observed.

Retrovirus-based gene therapy was begun in 1990 for the patients of adenosine deaminase deficiency, followed by X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and chronic granulomatous disease. Although treated patients have had excellent immune reconstitution and resolution of ongoing infections, complications such as a lymphoproliferative syndrome and a disappearance of gene-modified cells were observed in some clinical trials. To overcome these, ongoing and upcoming clinical trials use some new strategies. The use of preconditioning chemotherapy makes space in the bone marrow for the gene-treated stem cells and allows engraftment of multi lineage stem/progenitor cells. Self-inactivating vectors in which strong enhancers of long terminal repeat are eliminated may reduce the risk of insertional activation of proto-oncogene resulting in leukemia.

There was no significant overall risk of SPM (SIR=0.98; 95% CI=0.94-1.02); however, there were multiple site-specific risk patterns. The risk of breast and prostate cancer was significantly decreased overall and across age, latency and the year of diagnosis strata. There was an approximately 50% increased risk of colorectal cancer 5 years after MM diagnosis (Ptrend<0.001). The risk of hematological malignancies was significantly increased, notably for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SIR=6.51; 95% CI=5.42-7.83). There was a significant decreasing trend for AML over time, particularly for patients >/=65. However, no significant change in risk was noted after the introduction of autologous stem cell transplant among younger patients (<65 years).

We found that the number of URD alloHCT as a percentage of the estimated potential transplantations ranged from 11% for multiple myeloma to 54% for chronic myeloid leukemia, with an average percentage of 26% for all the disorders considered. In an analysis stratified by age groups (20 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 to 74 years), the utilization of URD alloHCT was higher in younger patients than in older patients for all disorders. Of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patients, approximately 66% underwent URD alloHCT later in the course of their disease (in second or greater complete remission). URD alloHCT is likely underused for potentially curable hematologic disorders, particularly in older patients.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is one of the most important enzymes in this process metabolizing both 6-MP and 6-TG to different methylated metabolites including methylthioinosine monophosphate (meTIMP) and methylthioguanosine monophosphate (meTGMP), respectively, with different suggested pharmacological and cytotoxic properties. While meTIMP is a potent inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) and significantly contributes to the cytotoxic effects of 6-MP, meTGMP, does not add much to the effects of 6-TG, and the cytotoxicity of 6-TG seems to be more dependent on incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) into DNA rather than inhibition of DNPS. In order to investigate the role of TPMT in metabolism and thus, cytotoxic effects of 6-MP and 6-TG, we knocked down the expression of the gene encoding the TPMT enzyme using specifically designed small interference RNA (siRNA) in human MOLT4 leukemia cells. The knock-down was confirmed at RNA, protein, and enzyme function levels. Apoptosis was determined using annexin V and propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. The results showed a 34% increase in sensitivity of MOLT4 cells to 1muM 6-TG after treatment with TPMT-targeting siRNA, as compared to cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA, while the sensitivity of the cells toward 6-MP was not affected significantly by down-regulation of the TPMT gene.

Ponatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor that was recently approved for treatment-refractory Philadelphia-positive leukemia. We show here potent inhibition of oncogenic RET by ponatinib, including the drug-insensitive V804M/L mutants. Ponatinib inhibited the growth of RET+ and BCR-ABL+ cells with similar potency, while not affecting RET-negative cells. Both in biochemical and in cellular assays ponatinib compared favorably with known RET inhibitors, such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, sorafenib, sunitinib and motesanib, used as reference compounds. We suggest that ponatinib should be considered for the treatment of RET+ tumors, in particular those expressing vandetanib-resistant V804M/L mutations.","['Mologni, Luca', 'Redaelli, Sara', 'Morandi, Andrea', 'Plaza-Menacho, Ivan', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Mologni L', 'Redaelli S', 'Morandi A', 'Plaza-Menacho I', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Dept. of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, 20900 Monza, Italy. luca.mologni@unimib.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mutant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CML', 'DMSO', 'FBS', 'FMTC', 'GDNF', 'Gatekeeper', 'MEN2', 'MTC', 'PTC', 'Ponatinib', 'RET', 'REarranged during Transfection', 'TKI', 'Thyroid cancer', 'Tyrosine kinase', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dimethyl sulfoxide', 'familial MTC', 'fetal bovine serum', 'glial-derived neurotrophic factor', 'medullary thyroid carcinoma', 'multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2', 'papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0303-7207(13)00272-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mce.2013.06.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2013 Sep 5;377(1-2):1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2013.06.025.

In this study, slide-based receptor autoradiography was used to quantify glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), dopaminergic D2, cannabinoid CB1 and acetylcholine M1/4 receptor levels in the brains of male heterozygous transmembrane domain neuregulin 1 mutant (Nrg1(+/-)) mice at two ages. Mutant mice expressed small but significant increases in NMDA receptor levels in the cingulate cortex (7%, p=0.044), sensory cortex (8%, p=0.024), and motor cortex (8%, p=0.047), effects that were independent of age. In the nucleus accumbens and thalamus Nrg1(+/-) mice exhibited age-dependent alterations in NMDA receptors. Nrg1(+/-) mice showed a statistically significant increase in NMDA receptor levels in the nucleus accumbens of 14-week-old Nrg1(+/-) mice compared to control littermates of the same age (12%, p=0.026), an effect that was not seen in 20-week-old mice. In contrast, NMDA receptor levels in the thalamus, while initially unchanged in 14-week-old mice, were then decreased in the 20-week-old Nrg1(+/-) mice compared to control littermates of the same age (14%, p=0.011). Nrg1(+/-) mutant mice expressed a significant reduction in D2 receptor levels (13-16%) in the striatum compared to controls, independent of age. While there was a borderline significant increase (6%, p=0.058) in cannabinoid CB1 receptor levels in the substantia nigra of Nrg1(+/-) mice compared to controls, CB1 as well as acetylcholine M1/4 receptors showed no change in Nrg1(+/-) mice in any other brain region examined. These data indicate that a Nrg1 transmembrane mutation produces selective imbalances in glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, which are two key systems believed to contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis. While the effects on these systems are subtle, they may underlie the susceptibility of these mutants to further impacts.","['Newell, K A', 'Karl, T', 'Huang, X F']","['Newell KA', 'Karl T', 'Huang XF']","['Centre for Translational Neuroscience, Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, School of Health Sciences, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia. knewell@uow.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptors, Dopamine)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neuregulin-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/analysis', 'Receptors, Dopamine/*analysis', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/analysis', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*analysis', 'Schizophrenia/genetics/physiopathology', 'Synaptic Transmission/physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid', 'ANOVA', 'CB1 receptor', 'D2 receptor', 'DISC1', 'EDTA', 'EGF', 'ErbB4', 'GABA', 'HEPES', 'MANOVA', 'N-methyl-d-aspartate', 'NMDA', 'NMDA receptor', 'Nrg1', 'Nrg1(+/-)', 'WT', 'analysis of variance', 'disrupted in schizophrenia 1', 'epidermal growth factor', 'ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid', 'gamma-aminobutyric acid', 'heterozygous transmembrane domain neuregulin 1 mutant mouse', 'mouse', 'multivariate analysis of variance', 'neuregulin', 'neuregulin 1', 'schizophrenia', 'v-erb-a erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 4', 'wild type-like']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-4522(13)00543-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2013 Sep 17;248:670-80. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.037.

We recently demonstrated a strong enhancement of the antitumor activity of snake (Walterinnesia aegyptia) venom (WEV) in vitro in breast carcinoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma cell lines but not in normal cells when the venom was combined with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NP). In the present study, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of WEV+NP in breast cancer- and prostate cancer-bearing experimental mouse models. Xenograft breast and prostate tumor mice models were randomized into 4 groups for each cancer model (10 mice per group) and were treated with vehicle (control), NP, WEV, or WEV+NP daily for 28 days post tumor inoculation. The tumor volumes were monitored throughout the experiment. On Day 28 post tumor inoculation, breast and prostate tumor cells were collected and either directly cultured for flow cytometry analysis or lysed for Western blot and ELISA analysis. Treatment with WEV+NP or WEV alone significantly reduced both breast and prostate tumor volumes compared to treatment with NP or vehicle alone. Compared to treatment with WEV alone, treatment of breast and prostate cancer cells with WEV+NP induced marked elevations in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydroperoxides, and nitric oxide; robust reductions in the levels of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL13, and CXCL16 and decreased surface expression of their cognate chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CXCR6; and subsequent reductions in the chemokine-dependent migration of both breast and prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells, respectively, and enhanced the induction of apoptosis by increasing the activity of caspase-3,-8, and -9 in both breast and prostate cancer cells.

We have previously reported that donor bone marrow (BM) precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pre-pDCs) can polarize donor T cells toward Th1 immunity and augment the GVL activity of donor T cells while attenuating their GVHD activity in a murine model of allogeneic HSCT. Clinical data on the role of donor pre-pDCs and conventional DCs (cDCs) on transplantation outcomes has been conflicting. To test the effect of increasing the proportion of pre-pDCs versus cDCs in a BM graft, we enriched CD11b(-) pDCs by selectively depleting the CD11b(+) myeloid DC (mDC) population from BM using FACS sorting in a murine model of allogeneic BM transplantation. Donor T cell expansion and GVL activity were greater in mice that received BM depleted of mDCs compared with mice that received undepleted BM. GVHD was not increased by depleting mDCs. To examine the mechanism through which mDC depletion enhances the GVL activity of donor T cells, we used BM and pDCs from IL-12p40KO mice, and found that the increased GVL activity of mDC-depleted BM was IL-12-dependent. This study indicates that a clinically translatable strategy of engineering the DC content of grafts can improve clinical outcomes in allogeneic HSCT through the regulation of donor T cell activation and GVL activity.","['Darlak, Katarzyna A', 'Wang, Ying', 'Li, Jian-Ming', 'Harris, Wayne A C', 'Owens, Lauren M', 'Waller, Edmund K']","['Darlak KA', 'Wang Y', 'Li JM', 'Harris WA', 'Owens LM', 'Waller EK']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130627,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Dendritic cell T cell', 'Graft-versus-leukemia', 'IL-12']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00287-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.06.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Sep;19(9):1331-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.06.016.

Trim28, a key player in this silencing, is known to act in a large DNA-bound complex, but the other components of the complex are not fully characterized. Here, we show that the zinc finger protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is one such component. YY1 binds to the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of both exogenous and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Deletion of the YY1-binding site from the retroviral genome leads to a major loss of silencing in embryonic cells and a coordinated loss of repressive histone marks from the proviral chromatin. Depletion of YY1 protein results in marked upregulation of expression of exogenous viruses and of selected ERVs. Finally, we report an embryonic cell-specific interaction between YY1 and Trim28. Our results suggest a major role for YY1 in the silencing of both exogenous retroviruses and ERVs in embryonic cells.","['Schlesinger, Sharon', 'Lee, Andreia H', 'Wang, Gary Z', 'Green, Lisa', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Schlesinger S', 'Lee AH', 'Wang GZ', 'Green L', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim28 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Silencing', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proviruses/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3771693,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/02/01 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00279-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 Jul 11;4(1):50-8. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.06.003.

METHODS: A pathology database at a tertiary hospital was searched for patients with biopsy specimens from the head and neck diagnosed as granulocytic sarcoma. RESULTS: There were 6 cases between 1992 and 2004 that met inclusion criteria. Subjects' age ranged from 22 months to 14 years old. In three cases, the patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on biopsy results; 2 patients were already diagnosed with AML when diagnosed with granulocytic sarcoma, and in 1 case, a relapse of AML was diagnosed. In all cases, patients began induction chemotherapy. Two patients died during induction chemotherapy from infection. The remaining 4 patients underwent bone marrow transplants. One patient had a relapse post-transplant and died. Only one patient was healthy two years post-transplant. CONCLUSION: The results of this series suggest granulocytic sarcoma must be on the differential when tumors present in the head and neck region in pediatric patients. In our series, 100% of the patients with granulocytic sarcoma had underlying AML. The long-term prognosis of patients with AML who developed granulocytic sarcoma is quite poor.","['Roby, Brianne Barnett', 'Drehner, Dennis', 'Sidman, James D']","['Roby BB', 'Drehner D', 'Sidman JD']","[""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Children's Specialty Center, Minneapolis, MN 55404, USA. barne284@umn.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130628,Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chloroma', 'Granulocytic sarcoma', 'Myeloid sarcoma']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-5876(13)00287-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2013 Aug;77(8):1364-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.06.008.

In this study, we investigated the effect of ALR on Jurkat T leukemia cell growth and survival. We found that ALR was up-regulated in Jurkat cells and could reduce the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to vincristine, but had a minimal effect on proliferation of Jurkat cells. Results from analysis of flow cytometry showed ALR attenuated apoptotic cells and inhibited G2/M-arrest in vincristine-treated Jurkat cells. Following incubation with ALR, an increase in pro-caspase8, pro-caspase3, pro-PARP and Bcl-2 levels was observed in vincristine-treated Jurkat cells.

Fludarabine and cytarabine were given on days 2 and 3 (cohort 1), days 2 to 4 (cohort 2), or days 2 to 5 (cohort 3) every 4 weeks. Phase II followed the ""3 + 3"" design of phase I. RESULTS: The 102 patients (CLL, 67; RS, 35) treated had heavily pretreated high-risk disease. Twelve patients were treated in phase I; cohort 2 was the phase II recommended dose. The most common toxicities were hematologic. Response rates (phase II) were 38.7% for RS (complete response [CR], 6.5%) and 50.8% for relapsed/refractory CLL (CR, 4.6%). The median survival durations were 6.6 (RS) and 20.6 (CLL) months. Among 9 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) as post-remission therapy, none has died (median follow-up, 15.9 months). CONCLUSION: OFAR2 had significant antileukemic activity in RS and relapsed/refractory CLL. Patients undergoing SCT as post-remission therapy had favorable outcomes.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia M', 'Wierda, William G', 'Wen, Sijin', 'Plunkett, William', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Badoux, Xavier', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Wierda WG', 'Wen S', 'Plunkett W', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kipps TJ', 'Jones JA', 'Badoux X', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, Phase I Clinical Trials Program, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment with imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib is the cornerstone of modern therapy for this hematologic malignancy. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR, also RQ-PCR) of BCR-ABL1 RNA is a necessary laboratory technique for monitoring the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and quantitatively assessing minimal residual disease. The molecular response measured by BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR assists in identifying suboptimal responses and can help inform the decision to switch to alternative therapies that may be more efficacious (or to pursue more stringent monitoring). Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-mediated molecular response provides valuable risk stratification and prognostic information on long-term outcomes. Despite these attributes, informed, universal, practical utilization of this well-established monitoring test will require heightened efforts by the molecular diagnostics laboratory community to adopt the standardized reporting units of the International Scale. Without widespread adoption of the International Scale, the consensus major molecular response and early molecular response treatment thresholds will not be definable, and optimal clinical outcomes for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia may not be achieved.","['Press, Richard D', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Ang, Daphne']","['Press RD', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Ang D']","['Department of Pathology and Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA. pressr@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130627,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(13)00100-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2013 Sep;15(5):565-76. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.04.007.

STUDY DESIGN: Gene expression of EGF was determined from human placental samples collected from all pregnancies presenting with IUGR at our institution during the study period January 1, 2010-January 1, 2011. Multiple clinical variables were also assessed including maternal age, gestational weight gain, increase of BMI during pregnancy and fetal gender. RESULTS: A total of 241 samples were obtained (101 in the IUGR pregnancy group, 140 in the normal pregnancy group). EGF was found to be underexpressed in the IUGR group compared to normal pregnancy (Ln2(alpha): -1.54; p<0.04). Within the IUGR group no fetal gender-dependent difference was seen in EGF gene expression (Ln2(alpha): 0.44; p<0.06). Similarly, no significant difference in EGF expression was noted in cases with more vs. less severe forms of IUGR (Ln2(alpha): -0.08; p=0.05). IUGR pregnancies were significantly more common in the maternal age group 35-44 years compared to other age groups. Gestational weight gain and gestational BMI increase were significantly lower in IUGR pregnancies compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Placental expression of EGF was found to be reduced in IUGR pregnancies vs. normal pregnancies. This may partly explain the smaller placental size and placental dysfunction commonly seen with IUGR. An increased incidence of IUGR was observed with maternal age exceeding 35 years. The probability of IUGR correlated with lower gestational weight gain and lower BMI increase during pregnancy.","['Rab, Attila', 'Szentpeteri, Imre', 'Kornya, Laszlo', 'Borzsonyi, Balazs', 'Demendi, Csaba', 'Joo, Jozsef Gabor']","['Rab A', 'Szentpeteri I', 'Kornya L', 'Borzsonyi B', 'Demendi C', 'Joo JG']","['Telki Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130627,Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,['62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AC', 'BMI', 'Body mass index', 'EGF', 'EGF-receptor', 'EGFR', 'Epidermal growth factor', 'ErbB-1-4', 'Gene expression', 'IGF-1', 'IGF-2', 'IUGR', 'Intrauterine growth restriction', 'LIF', 'Maternal age', 'Placenta', 'TGF-alpha', 'TGF-beta', 'VEGF-A', 'abdominal circumference', 'body mass index', 'epidermal growth factor', 'erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-4', 'insulin-like growth factor 1', 'insulin-like growth factor 2', 'intrauterine growth restriction', 'leukemia inhibiting factor', 'transforming growth factor alfa', 'transforming growth factor beta', 'vascular endothelial growth factor A']",2013/07/03 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-2115(13)00251-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.05.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2013 Sep;170(1):96-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.05.020.

The paradigms for success in the treatment of childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, Burkett's lymphoma, and testicular carcinoma with cytotoxic chemotherapy did not translate to success in solid tumors--the majority of cancers that kill. In contrast, significant success has accrued for patients with breast cancer with antihormone treatments (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) that are proved to enhance survivorship, and remarkably, there are now two approved prevention strategies using either tamoxifen or raloxifene. This was considered impossible 40 years ago. We describe the major clinical advances with nonsteroidal antiestrogens that evolved into selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) which successfully exploited the ER target selectively inside a woman's body. The standard paradigm that estrogen stimulates breast cancer growth has been successfully exploited for over 4 decades with therapeutic strategies that block (tamoxifen, raloxifene) or reduce (aromatase inhibitors) circulating estrogens in patients to stop breast tumor growth. But this did not explain why high-dose estrogen treatment that was the standard of care to treat postmenopausal breast cancer for 3 decades before tamoxifen caused tumor regression. This paradox was resolved with the discovery that breast cancer resistance to long-term estrogen deprivation causes tumor regression with physiologic estrogen through apoptosis. The new biology of estrogen action has been utilized to explain the findings in the Women's Health Initiative that conjugated equine estrogen alone given to postmenopausal women, average age 68, will produce a reduction of breast cancer incidence and mortality compared to no treatment. Estrogen is killing nascent breast cancer cells in the ducts of healthy postmenopausal women. The modulation of the ER using multifunctional medicines called SERMs has provided not only significant improvements in women's health and survivorship not anticipated 40 years ago but also has been the catalyst to enhance our knowledge of estrogen's apoptotic action that can be further exploited in the future.","['McDaniel, Russell E', 'Maximov, Philipp Y', 'Jordan, V Craig']","['McDaniel RE', 'Maximov PY', 'Jordan VC']","['Department of Oncology, Georgetown University, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Estrogens/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Translational Research, Biomedical']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-416673-8.00007-1 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-416673-8.00007-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2013;93:1-49. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-416673-8.00007-1.,['P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A two-dimensional (or transverse) acoustic trapping was demonstrated by directly applying the acoustic radiation force on lipid spheres and leukemia cells that were individually moved towards the focus. Only longitudinal waves were then considered because both target and propagation media involved were fluid e.g., water or phosphate buffer saline. In order for our current technique to be applicable to bead-based assay approaches using micron-sized polystyrene spheres as in optical tweezers, the possibility of microbead trapping must first be investigated from theoretical perspective. In this paper, a simulation study in the ray acoustics regime (bead diameter D>ultrasonic wavelength lambda of trapping beam) is thus undertaken by calculating the acoustic radiation force on a polystyrene bead generated from 30 MHz focused beam of Gaussian intensity profile. Analytical trapping models for a bead located in the near-/far fields and on the focal plane are derived by incorporating both longitudinal- and shear force terms into our existing ray acoustics model for liquid targets. The net radiation force is computed by adding the two terms, and the resultant trapping force is defined as a negative net radiation force in the positive transverse direction (y>0). The magnitude of the trapping force and its spatial range are evaluated in the same direction by varying bead size (D=2 lambda=100 mum or 3 lambda=150 mum), location, and transducer's f-number (= 1 or 2). When the bead size is increased, all force components exerted on the bead is increased in the near field of ultrasound for both f-numbers. With f-number=1 being used, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net forces are -3.1 nN, -9.8 nN, and -12.7 nN for D=2 lambda, whereas the forces are increased to -5.3 nN, -21.0 nN, and -25.7 nN for D=3 lambda. In case of f-number=2, the peak magnitudes of the forces are 1.2 nN, -7.8 nN, and -6.6 nN for D=2 lambda, whereas they are increased to 5.9 nN, -17.1 nN, and -12.0 nN for D=3 lambda. With f-number=1, the net trapping forces at (0, y, -2 lambda) can be reached to -39.8 nN for D=2 lambda and -65.2 nN for D=3 lambda, and -7.8 nN for D=2 lambda and -15.2 nN for D=3 lambda at (0, y, -14 lambda). When f-number=2 is used, the peak trapping forces at (0, y, -2 lambda) can be -3.4 nN for D=2 lambda and -5.9 n N for D=3 lambda, while they are -6.3 nN for D=2 lambda and -12.0 nN for D=3 lambda at (0, y, -14 lambda). In the near filed, the bead can be trapped in the range from 0 to 340 mum for D=2 lambda, and from 0 to 380 mum for D=3 lambda. The trapping range Rtrap with f-number=2 lies from 0 to 295 mum for D=2 lambda, and from 0 to 340 mum for D=3 lambda. As either a larger bead or a lower f-numbered trapping beam is used, a stronger trapping force can be produced in the region. When a bead is more closely positioned to the focus, the trapping occurs in multiple locations and the net force variation becomes more complicated. In the far field, with f-number=1 being used, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net forces are 4.6 nN, 6.8 nN, and 11.4 nN for D=2 lambda, whereas the forces are increased to 11.4 nN, 12.1 nN, and 23.6 nN for D=3 lambda. In case of f-number=2, the maximum value of each force is 4.4 nN, 1.8 nN, and 5.0 nN for D=2 lambda, respectively, whereas it becomes 12.3 nN, -0.7 nN, and 10.6 nN for D=3 lambda. The bead is forced to move away from the beam axis by a positive net force for y>0 and a negative net force for y<0. With f-number=1, the peak repulsive forces at (0, y, 5 lambda) can be 25.8 nN for D=2 lambda and 49.9 nN for D=3 lambda, and 3.4 nN for D=2 lambda and 7.5 nN for D=3 lambda at (0, y, 20 lambda). When f-number=2 is used, the forces at (0, y, 5 lambda) can be 3.9 nN for D=2 lambda and 9.5 nN for D=3 lambda, while they are 3.7 nN for D=2 lambda and 7.8 nN for D=3 lambda at (0, y, 20 lambda). As the bead is placed farther away from the focus, the net repulsive force is reduced and yet the bead trapping is difficult throughout the far-field region. On the focal plane, with f-number=1, the peak longitudinal-, shear- , and net trapping forces are 31.8 nN, -36.2 nN, and -16.5 nN for D=2 lambda, whereas the forces are changed to 73.9 nN, -58.2 nN, and -42.7 nN for D=3 lambda. In case of f-number=2, the peak magnitudes of the forces are 6.4 nN, -7.0 nN, and -1.6 nN for D=2 lambda, whereas they are increased to 18.1 nN, -15.8 nN, and -3.9 nN for D=3 lambda.

Current risk allocation schemas are imperfect, as some children are classified as lower-risk and treated with less intensive therapy relapse, while others deemed higher-risk are probably over-treated. Most cooperative groups previously used morphological clearance of blasts in blood and marrow during the initial phases of chemotherapy as a primary factor for risk group allocation; however, this has largely been replaced by the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). Other than age and white blood cell count (WBC) at presentation, many clinical variables previously used for risk group allocation are no longer prognostic, as MRD and the presence of sentinel genetic lesions are more reliable at predicting outcome. Currently, a number of sentinel genetic lesions are used by most cooperative groups for risk stratification; however, in the near future patients will probably be risk-stratified using genomic signatures and clustering algorithms, rather than individual genetic alterations. This review will describe the clinical, biological, and response-based features known to predict relapse risk in childhood ALL, including those currently used and those likely to be used in the near future to risk-stratify therapy.","['Teachey, David T', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Teachey DT', 'Hunger SP']","[""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130629,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'childhood haematological malignancies', 'cytogenetics of leukaemia', 'minimal residual disease']",2013/07/03 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12442 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Sep;162(5):606-20. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12442.

We show that after 24h fludarabine exposure: (i) 5 out of 8 ATM-deficient samples (63%) normally accumulated p53 protein, and (ii) all analyzed ATM-deficient samples (n = 7) manifested clear induction of p21, PUMA, BAX, and GADD45 genes.

These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.","['Kitson, Sean L', 'Cuccurullo, Vincenzo', 'Moody, Thomas S', 'Mansi, Luigi']","['Kitson SL', 'Cuccurullo V', 'Moody TS', 'Mansi L']","['Department of Biocatalysis and Isotope Chemistry, Almac, 20 Seagoe Industrial Estate, Craigavon, BT63 5QD, United Kingdom. sean.kitson@almacgroup.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Radiopharm,Current radiopharmaceuticals,101468718,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)', 'K1KT5M40JC (tositumomab I-131)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Melanoma/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radionuclide Generators', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/*therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/radiotherapy']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['CRP-EPUB-20130628-1 [pii]', '10.2174/1874471011306020001 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Radiopharm. 2013 Jun 6;6(2):57-71. doi: 10.2174/1874471011306020001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many spermatogonial markers have been reported in rodents. However, few markers have been identified in pig spermatogonia. Despite the lack of information, it is necessary to separate pure spermatogonial cells from whole testicular cells to understand the mechanism of spermatogenic meiosis and to establish spermatogonial stem cells for further biotechnological studies. The purpose of this study was to identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha-1) as a surface marker for early spermatogonia in neonatal pig testes. Histological analysis of 3-day-old pig testes revealed that type A spermatogonia, which lack heterochromatin, could be distinguished in neonatal pig testes. Immunohistochemistry of neonatal pig testes with GFRalpha-1 antibody identified that some of the spermatogonial cells expressed GFRalpha-1 on the cell membrane. Co-immunostaining with both GFRalpha-1 and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) detected PGP 9.5 in all spermatogonia of neonatal pig testes, whereas GFRalpha-1 was not detected on the surface of some PGP 9.5-positive cells, indicating that some of the spermatogonial cells were PGP 9.5 positive and GFRalpha-1 negative. After immunomagnetic cell sorting using a GFRalpha-1 antibody, both GFRalpha-1-positive and GFRalpha-1-negative cells expressed PGP 9.5. Identifying the differential mRNA expression of both GFRalpha-1-positive and GFRalpha-1-negative cells using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the expression of promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger, octamer-binding protein 4 and homeobox transcription factor in both cell types. These results suggest that GFRalpha-1-positive and GFRalpha-1-negative spermatogonia exist in PGP 9.5-positive spermatogonia during the early stage of pig testes spermatogenesis, and that GFRalpha-1 can be used for sorting PGP 9.5-expressing spermatogonia.","['Lee, K H', 'Lee, W Y', 'Kim, J H', 'Yoon, M J', 'Kim, N H', 'Kim, J H', 'Uhm, S J', 'Kim, D H', 'Chung, H J', 'Song, H']","['Lee KH', 'Lee WY', 'Kim JH', 'Yoon MJ', 'Kim NH', 'Kim JH', 'Uhm SJ', 'Kim DH', 'Chung HJ', 'Song H']","['Department of Animal and Food Bioscience, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, Chung-ju, Korea, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,['0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Swine/*physiology', 'Testis/*metabolism']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/rda.12193 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2013 Dec;48(6):954-60. doi: 10.1111/rda.12193.

Increased binase cytotoxicity toward the cells, expressing FLT3-ITD oncogene, suggests that, as in the case of FDC-P1 cells, transduced by KIT oncogene, the expression of an activated oncogene determines the sensitivity of cells to binase.","[""Mit'kevich, V A"", 'Orlova, N N', 'Petrushanko, I Iu', 'Simonenko, O V', 'Spirin, P V', 'Prokofeva, M M', 'Gornostaeva, A S', 'Stocking, C', 'Makarov, A A', 'Prasolov, V S']","[""Mit'kevich VA"", 'Orlova NN', 'Petrushanko IIu', 'Simonenko OV', 'Spirin PV', 'Prokofeva MM', 'Gornostaeva AS', 'Stocking C', 'Makarov AA', 'Prasolov VS']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.1 (ribonuclease T(2))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/07/03 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/07/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7868/s0026898413020092 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2013 Mar-Apr;47(2):282-5. doi: 10.7868/s0026898413020092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since April 2007, we have used a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tool (HemaVision) to detect of GA. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the results of HemaVision screening in 270 children with acute leukemia, newly diagnosed at The Catholic University of Korea from April 2007 to December 2011, and compared the results with those of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and G-band karyotyping. RESULTS: Among the 270 children (153 males, 117 females), 187 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 74 acute myeloid leukemia patients were identified. Overall, GA was detected in 230 patients (85.2%). HemaVision, FISH, and G-band karyotyping identified GA in 125 (46.3%), 126 (46.7%), and 215 patients (79.6%), respectively. TEL-AML1 (20.9%, 39/187) and AML1-ETO (27%, 20/74) were the most common GA in ALL and AML, respectively. Overall sensitivity of HemaVision was 98.4%, with false-negative results in 2 instances: 1 each for TEL-AML1 and MLL-AF4. An aggregate of diseasesspecific FISH showed 100% sensitivity in detection of GA covered by HemaVision for actual probes utilized. G-band karyotype revealed GA other than those covered by HemaVison screening in 133 patients (49.3%). Except for hyperdiplody and hypodiploidy, recurrent GA as defined by the World Health Organizationthat were not screened by HemaVision, were absent in the karyotype. CONCLUSION: HemaVision, supported by an aggregate of FISH tests for important translocations, may allow for accurate diagnosis of GA in Korean children with acute leukemia.","['Kim, Hye-Jin', 'Oh, Hyun Jin', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Kim HJ', 'Oh HJ', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Kim M', 'Lim J', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130621,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,PMC3693043,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Child', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'HemaVision', 'Karyotype']",2013/06/29 06:00,2013/06/29 06:01,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2013.56.6.247 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2013 Jun;56(6):247-53. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2013.56.6.247.

The prevalence of systemic mastocytosis in such patients is not precisely known. Bone marrow biopsies from 59 patients with mastocytosis in the skin and all available skin biopsies (n=27) were subjected to a meticulous cytological, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis for the presence of WHO-defined diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis: compact mast cell infiltrates (major criterion); atypical mast cell morphology, KIT D816V, abnormal expression of CD25 by mast cells, and serum tryptase levels >20 ng/ml (minor criteria). Systemic mastocytosis is diagnosed when the major diagnostic criterion plus one minor criterion or at least three minor criteria are fulfilled. Systemic mastocytosis was confirmed in 57 patients (97%) by the diagnosis of compact mast cell infiltrates plus at least one minor diagnostic criterion (n=42, 71%) or at least three minor diagnostic criteria (n=15, 25%). In two patients, only two minor diagnostic criteria were detectable, insufficient for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. By the use of highly sensitive molecular methods, including the analysis of microdissected mast cells, KIT D816V was found in all 58 bone marrow biopsies investigated for it but only in 74% (20/27) of the skin biopsies. It is important to state that even in cases with insufficient diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis, KIT D816V-positive mast cells were detected in the bone marrow. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that almost all patients with adult-onset mastocytosis in the skin, in fact, have systemic mastocytosis with cutaneous involvement.","['Berezowska, Sabina', 'Flaig, Michael J', 'Rueff, Franziska', 'Walz, Christoph', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Krokowski, Manuela', 'Kerler, Roswitha', 'Petat-Dutter, Karina', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl']","['Berezowska S', 'Flaig MJ', 'Rueff F', 'Walz C', 'Haferlach T', 'Krokowski M', 'Kerler R', 'Petat-Dutter K', 'Horny HP', 'Sotlar K']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Schleswig Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130628,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Male', '*Mast Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Mastocytoma, Skin/blood/chemistry/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microdissection', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', '*Skin/chemistry/pathology', 'Tryptases/blood', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2013117 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2013.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2014 Jan;27(1):19-29. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2013.117.

P53 deletion is associated with a very poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM). In this regard, we tested the anti-MM activity of RGB-286638, an indenopyrazole-derived CDKI with Ki-nanomolar activity against transcriptional CDKs. We examined RGB-286638's mode-of-action in MM cell lines with wild-type (wt)-p53 and those expressing mutant p53. RGB-286638 treatment resulted in MM cytotoxicity in vitro associated with inhibition of MM tumor growth and prolonged survival in vivo. RGB-286638 displayed caspase-dependent apoptosis in both wt-p53 and mutant-p53 cells that was closely associated with the downregulation of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and inhibition of transcription. RGB-286638 triggered p53 accumulation via nucleolar stress and loss of Mdm2, accompanied by induction of p53 DNA-binding activity. In addition, RGB-286638 mediated p53-independent activity, which was confirmed by cytotoxicity in p53-knockdown and p53-mutant cells. We also demonstrated downregulation of oncogenic miR-19, miR-92a-1 and miR-21. Our data provide the rationale for the development of transcriptional CDKIs as therapeutic agents, which activate p53 in competent cells, while circumventing p53 deficiency through alternative p53-independent cell death mechanisms in p53-mutant/deleted cells.","['Cirstea, D', 'Hideshima, T', 'Santo, L', 'Eda, H', 'Mishima, Y', 'Nemani, N', 'Hu, Y', 'Mimura, N', 'Cottini, F', 'Gorgun, G', 'Ohguchi, H', 'Suzuki, R', 'Loferer, H', 'Munshi, N C', 'Anderson, K C', 'Raje, N']","['Cirstea D', 'Hideshima T', 'Santo L', 'Eda H', 'Mishima Y', 'Nemani N', 'Hu Y', 'Mimura N', 'Cottini F', 'Gorgun G', 'Ohguchi H', 'Suzuki R', 'Loferer H', 'Munshi NC', 'Anderson KC', 'Raje N']","['1] MGH Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [2] Leebow Institute of Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Disease Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130628,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RGB 286638)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3928098,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2366-75. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.194.

Peripheral blood CD4+ CXCR5+ T cells, known as circulating follicular helper T cells (Tfh), can induce B cell activation and production of specific antibody responses. The aim of the study was to investigate changes of circulating Tfh in CLL. Tfh and it subtypes were tested by measuring CD4, CXCR5, CXCR3, and CCR6 in 72 CLL cases and 86 healthy controls using flow cytometry. Data showed that the percentage of Tfh in the peripheral CD4+ T cells was significantly increased in CLL (25.1%) than in controls (8.4%) (p < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that the upregulation of Tfh was contributed by Tfh-th2 subtype and Tfh-th17 subtype. Investigating staging of the cases demonstrated that the prevalence of Tfh was significantly elevated in cases with Binet stage C (37.3%) than those with stage A (20.1 %) or stage B (23.9 %). In addition, we analyzed Tfh in patients with immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IGHV) gene mutational status. Results presented that Tfh-th17 subtype had clearly higher frequency in patients with IGHV mutation compared to the unmutated cases (p = 0.035). This study suggested the involvement of Tfh in the pathogenesis and progression of CLL, and provided a potential target for treating this disease.","['Cha, Zhanshan', 'Zang, Yan', 'Guo, Huijun', 'Rechlic, James R', 'Olasnova, Lindsay M', 'Gu, Haihui', 'Tu, Xiaohua', 'Song, Haihan', 'Qian, Baohua']","['Cha Z', 'Zang Y', 'Guo H', 'Rechlic JR', 'Olasnova LM', 'Gu H', 'Tu X', 'Song H', 'Qian B']","['Department of Transfusion, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130627,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (CCR6 protein, human)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, CCR6)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, CCR6/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR3/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-013-0937-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Dec;34(6):3579-85. doi: 10.1007/s13277-013-0937-2.

When examining 6 human leukemia cell lines using calcein-encapsulated SALs in combination with Bi-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Bi-anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (MAb) or Bi-anti-CD7 MAb, the fluorescent positive rate of each cell line was in almost proportion to degree of G-CSF receptor, CD33 or CD7 expression, respectively. More importantly, the binding ability was shown to be well maintained in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore the cytosine arabinoside (AraC)-encapsulated SALs could kill the corresponding cells much more effectively in combination with Bi-biomaterials than free AraC, as expected. These findings strongly indicate that our SAL/Bi-biomaterial system could allow various types of medical agents to be delivered reliably and stably to the cells targeted.","['Chen, Ming-Han', 'Soda, Yasushi', 'Izawa, Kiyoko', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Tani, Kenzaburo', 'Maruyama, Kazuo', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Asano, Shigetaka']","['Chen MH', 'Soda Y', 'Izawa K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Tani K', 'Maruyama K', 'Tojo A', 'Asano S']","['Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University Hospital, I-Lan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130624,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD7/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', '*Biotinylation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Cytarabine/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Streptavidin/*chemistry', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biotin', 'Drug delivery system', 'Immunoliposome', 'Internalization', 'Streptavidin', 'Tumor-targeting']",2013/06/29 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(13)00540-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2013 Sep 15;454(1):478-85. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.031.

Detection of these abnormalities and other molecular changes is of increasing interest because it contributes to a refined diagnosis and prognostic assessment in AML and enables monitoring of minimal residual disease. These genetic abnormalities can be detected using single RT-PCR, although the screening is still labor intensive and costly. We have developed a novel real-time RT-PCR assay to simultaneously detect 15 AML-associated rearrangements that is a simple and easily applicable method for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories. This method showed 100% specificity and sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 91% to 100% and 92% to 100%, respectively). The procedure was validated in a series of 105 patients with AML. The method confirmed all translocations detected using standard cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization and some additional undetected rearrangements. Two patients demonstrated two molecular rearrangements simultaneously, with BCR-ABL1 implicated in both, in addition to RUNX1-MECOM in one patient and PML-RARA in another. In conclusion, this novel real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of multiple AML-associated fusion genes is a versatile and sensitive method for reliable screening of recurrent rearrangements in AML.","['Dolz, Sandra', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Fuster, Oscar', 'Llop, Marta', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Such, Esperanza', 'De Juan, Inmaculada', 'Palanca, Sarai', 'Murria, Rosa', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Luna, Irene', 'Gomez, Ines', 'Lopez, Maria', 'Ibanez, Mariam', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Dolz S', 'Barragan E', 'Fuster O', 'Llop M', 'Cervera J', 'Such E', 'De Juan I', 'Palanca S', 'Murria R', 'Bolufer P', 'Luna I', 'Gomez I', 'Lopez M', 'Ibanez M', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(13)00095-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2013 Sep;15(5):678-86. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.04.003.

There is increasing evidence that the grey matter may be involved in autoimmune inflammation during relapses of MS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a single transfer of encephalitogenic T cells, mimicking a relapse of MS, may cause hippocampal damage and memory disturbances in rats. Lewis rats were injected with anti-MBP CD4+ T cells, that induced one-phase autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with full recovery from motor impairments at 10-15 days. The spatial learning and memory were tested by the Morris water maze test in control and EAE animals, 30 and 90 days post-induction (dpi). The neural injury and inflammation was investigated in the hippocampus by immunohistochemistry and quantitative analyses. There was a marked decrease in the number of CA1 and CA4 pyramidal neurons 5 dpi. The loss of neurons then aggravated till the 90 dpi. An increase in microglial and astroglial activation and in pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in the hippocampus, were present 30 and 90 dpi. Nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels were also significantly elevated. The water maze test, however, did not reveal memory deficits. The present data indicate that a single transfer of autoimmune T cells results in preserved inflammation and probable on-going neuronal injury in the hippocampus, long after recovery from motor disturbances. These findings suggest that any relapse of the MS may start the neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus, which is not necessarily connected with memory deficits.","['Kurkowska-Jastrzebska, I', 'Swiatkiewicz, M', 'Zaremba, M', 'Cudna, A', 'Piechal, A', 'Pyrzanowska, J', 'Widy-Tyszkiewicz, E', 'Czlonkowska, A']","['Kurkowska-Jastrzebska I', 'Swiatkiewicz M', 'Zaremba M', 'Cudna A', 'Piechal A', 'Pyrzanowska J', 'Widy-Tyszkiewicz E', 'Czlonkowska A']","['2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland. ikurkowska@ipin.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hippocampus/metabolism/*pathology', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Maze Learning', 'Memory Disorders/immunology', 'Microglia/metabolism', 'Multiple Sclerosis/immunology', 'Nerve Degeneration/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BDNF', 'DIR', 'DNF', 'EAE', 'GAPDH', 'GFAP', 'IL', 'Iba1', 'MLV', 'MOG', 'MRI', 'Moloney murine leukaemia virus', 'NGF', 'NeuN', 'PBS', 'TNF', 'autoimmune encephalomyelitis', 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor', 'days post EAE induction', 'double inversion recovery', 'dpi', 'glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase', 'hippocampus', 'interleukin', 'ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'memory', 'multiple sclerosis', 'myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein', 'nerve growth factor', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuroinflammation', 'nuclear neuron protein', 'phosphate-buffered saline', 'tumour necrosis factor']",2013/06/29 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-4522(13)00531-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2013 Sep 17;248:690-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.025.

The importance of Notch signalling in liver development and morphogenesis is well established. However, the post-natal role of Notch in liver repair/regeneration is only now beginning to be unveiled. Despite the simplicity of the pathway activation, a fine spatial-temporal regulation of Notch signalling is required to avoid pathologic effects. This review highlights recent advances in the field indicating that Notch signalling is involved in the reparative morphogenesis of the biliary tree and in liver carcinogenesis. Defective Notch signalling leads to impaired ability of the liver to repair liver damage, while excessive activation may be involved in liver cancer. Even though much remains to be understood about these mechanisms, including the cross-talk between Notch signalling and other liver morphogens, current evidence suggests that the modulation of the Notch pathway may represent a therapeutic target in chronic liver disease.","['Morell, Carola Maria', 'Fiorotto, Romina', 'Fabris, Luca', 'Strazzabosco, Mario']","['Morell CM', 'Fiorotto R', 'Fabris L', 'Strazzabosco M']","['Department of Surgery and Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130624,France,Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,101553659,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Biliary Tract/cytology/physiology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/physiopathology', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/physiopathology', 'Hepatocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Liver/embryology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Liver Regeneration/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/physiology', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AGS', 'Alagille syndrome', 'CCA', 'CSC', 'HCC', 'HNF', 'HPC', 'IGF2', 'IHBD', 'Jag-1', 'Jagged-1', 'N1ICD', 'N2ICD', 'NICD', 'NOS2', 'Notch intracellular domain', 'Notch-1 intracellular domain', 'Notch-2 intracellular domain', 'RBP-Jkappa', 'Sox-9', 'T-ALL', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'cancer stem cell', 'cholangiocarcinoma', 'hepatic progenitor cell', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'hepatocyte nuclear factor', 'inducible nitric oxide synthase', 'insulin-like-growth factor 2', 'intrahepatic bile duct', 'recombination signal binding protein immunoglobulin kappa J', 'sex determining region Y-box 9']",2013/06/29 06:00,2014/07/10 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7401(13)00120-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinre.2013.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol. 2013 Nov;37(5):447-54. doi: 10.1016/j.clinre.2013.05.008.

The chemokine signaling pathway and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis were markedly upregulated in HL-60 cells. In THP1 cells, highly expressed genes ensured strong phagocytosis by monocytes.

A specific interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 found in a high proportion of rAML is recognised as the initiating event. The deletion leads to the loss of Sfpi, a gene essential for haematopoietic development. Its product, the transcription factor PU.1 acts as a tumour suppressor in this model. Although the deletion can be detected early following ionising radiation exposure by cytogenetic techniques, precise characterisation of the haematopoietic cells carrying the deletion and the study of their fate in vivo cannot be achieved. Here, using a genetically engineered C57BL/6 mouse model expressing the GFP fluorescent molecule under the control of the Sfpi1 promoter, which we have bred onto the rAML-susceptible CBA/H strain, we demonstrate that GFP expression did not interfere with X-ray induced leukaemia incidence and that GFP fluorescence in live leukaemic cells is a surrogate marker of radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletions with or without point mutations on the remaining allele of the Sfpi1 gene.

In this study, we analyzed whether these prototypic activators of apoptosis are also expressed and able to be activated in human pluripotent stem cells. We examined human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and found that both cell types express primarily TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors and TNFR1, but very low levels of Fas/CD95. We also found that although hESC and hiPSC contain all the proteins required for efficient induction and progression of extrinsic apoptotic signaling, they are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, both hESC and hiPSC can be sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by co-treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors such as the anti-leukemia drug homoharringtonine (HHT). HHT treatment led to suppression of cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and Mcl-1 expression and, in combination with TRAIL, enhanced processing of caspase-8 and full activation of caspase-3. cFLIP likely represents an important regulatory node, as its shRNA-mediated down-regulation significantly sensitized hESC to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, we provide the first evidence that, irrespective of their origin, human pluripotent stem cells express canonical components of the extrinsic apoptotic system and on stress can activate death receptor-mediated apoptosis.","['Vinarsky, Vladimir', 'Krivanek, Jan', 'Rankel, Liina', 'Nahacka, Zuzana', 'Barta, Tomas', 'Jaros, Josef', 'Andera, Ladislav', 'Hampl, Ales']","['Vinarsky V', 'Krivanek J', 'Rankel L', 'Nahacka Z', 'Barta T', 'Jaros J', 'Andera L', 'Hampl A']","['1 Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University , Brno, Czech Republic .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130802,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3822377,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2014/06/13 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2013.0057 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Nov 15;22(22):2964-74. doi: 10.1089/scd.2013.0057.

Recent studies in vertebrates show that many TFs preferentially bind to genomic regions that are well bound by nucleosomes in vitro. Co-occurring secondary motifs sometimes correlated with functional TFBS. RESULTS: We used a logistic regression to evaluate how well the propensity for nucleosome binding and co-occurrence of a secondary motif identify which canonical motifs are bound in vivo. We used ChIP-seq data for three transcription factors binding to their canonical motifs: c-Jun binding the AP-1 motif (TGA(C)/(G)TCA), GR (glucocorticoid receptor) binding the GR motif (G-ACA---(T)/(C)GT-C), and Hoxa2 (homeobox a2) binding the Pbx (Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox) motif (TGATTGAT). For all canonical TFBS in the mouse genome, we calculated intrinsic nucleosome occupancy scores (INOS) for its surrounding 150-bps DNA and examined the relationship with in vivo TF binding. In mouse mammary 3134 cells, c-Jun and GR proteins preferentially bound regions calculated to be well-bound by nucleosomes in vitro with the canonical AP-1 and GR motifs themselves contributing to the high INOS. Functional GR motifs are enriched for AP-1 motifs if they are within a nucleosome-sized 150-bps region. GR and Hoxa2 also bind motifs with low INOS, perhaps indicating a different mechanism of action. CONCLUSION: Our analysis quantified the contribution of INOS and co-occurring sequence to the identification of functional canonical motifs in the genome. This analysis revealed an inherent competition between some TFs and nucleosomes for binding canonical TFBS. GR and c-Jun cooperate if they are within 150-bps. Binding of Hoxa2 and a fraction of GR to motifs with low INOS values suggesting they are not in competition with nucleosomes and may function using different mechanisms.","['He, Ximiao', 'Chatterjee, Raghunath', 'John, Sam', 'Bravo, Hector', 'Sathyanarayana, B K', 'Biddie, Simon C', 'FitzGerald, Peter C', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, John A', 'Hager, Gordon L', 'Vinson, Charles']","['He X', 'Chatterjee R', 'John S', 'Bravo H', 'Sathyanarayana BK', 'Biddie SC', 'FitzGerald PC', 'Stamatoyannopoulos JA', 'Hager GL', 'Vinson C']","['Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130628,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3700821,,,2013/06/29 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/06/29 06:00'],"['2013/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-14-428 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-14-428 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2013 Jun 28;14:428. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-428.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population stratification and/or complicated interpretation of evidence on the risk of cancer (due to the small number of patients included in most series) lead to inconsistent data. Herein we investigated the risk of occurrence of malignancies at different sites of origin in a series of 517 psoriasis patients and their 1st degree relatives. METHODS: We evaluated the tumour spectrum as well as the age of the patient at diagnosis of cancers in psoriasis families along with the observed and expected frequencies of malignancies. The distribution of 17 common mutations/polymorphisms in 10 known cancer susceptibility genes among psoriasis patients and 517 matched healthy controls were examined. No such study has been published to date. RESULTS: The statistical comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of cancers revealed a higher than expected occurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma among males in psoriasis families when compared to the general population (OR=1.8, 95%CI 1.6-2.1, p=0.002). There was a non-significant tendency towards a younger age of onset and overrepresentation of laryngeal cancer and leukaemia in psoriasis families. We found no major differences in the distribution of cancer susceptibility mutations among our cases and the healthy controls.

RESULTS: MTT results showed that T-2 toxin inhibited HL60 proliferation on dose-dependent. Morphological observation showed significant apoptotic morphological characteristics. FCM results showed that the apoptosis rates of HL60 cells in T-2 toxin treatment groups were higher than that in control, and positive dose-effect correlations could be found.

Lessons from a century of cancer chemotherapy.,68,10.3389/fphar.2013.00068 [doi],"U.S. SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) data for age-adjusted mortality rates for all cancers combined for all races show only a modest overall 13% decline over the past 35 years. Moreover, the greatest contributor to cancer mortality is treatment-resistant metastatic disease. The accepted therapeutic paradigm for the past half-century for the treatment of advanced cancers has involved the use of systemic chemotherapy drugs cytotoxic for cycling cells (both normal and malignant) during DNA synthesis and/or mitosis. The failure of this therapeutic modality to achieve high-level, consistent rates of disease-free survival for some of the most common cancers, including tumors of the lung, colon breast, brain, melanoma, and others is the focus of this paper. A retrospective assessment of critical milestones in cancer chemotherapy indicates that most successful therapeutic regimens use cytotoxic cell cycle inhibitors in combined, maximum tolerated, dose-dense acute treatment regimens originally developed to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and some lymphomas. Early clinical successes in this area led to their wholesale application to the treatment of solid tumor malignancies that, unfortunately, has not produced consistent, long-term high cure rates for many common cancers. Important differences in therapeutic sensitivity of leukemias/lymphomas versus solid tumors can be explained by key biological differences that define the treatment-resistant solid tumor phenotype. A review of these clinical outcome data in the context of recent developments in our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms characteristic of solid tumors suggests the need for a new paradigm for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant cancers. In contrast to reductionist approaches, the systemic approach targets both microenvironmental and systemic factors that drive and sustain tumor progression. These systemic factors include dysregulated inflammatory and oxidation pathways shown to be directly implicated in the development and maintenance of the cancer phenotype. The paradigm stresses the importance of a combined preventive/therapeutic approach involving adjuvant chemotherapies that incorporate anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant therapeutics.","['Crawford, Sarah']",['Crawford S'],"['Cancer Biology Research Laboratory, Southern Connecticut State University New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130625,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC3691519,['NOTNLM'],"['adjuvant', 'anti-inflammatory', 'anti-oxidant', 'chemotherapy', 'drug resistance', 'neoplasm', 'tumor microenvironment']",2013/06/28 06:00,2013/06/28 06:01,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2013.00068 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2013 Jun 25;4:68. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2013.00068. eCollection 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much is known about initial cues that drive memory formation, but it is poorly understood which signals are essential during the intermediate stages before terminal differentiation. NKG2D is an activating coreceptor on Ag-experienced CD8 T cells that promotes effector cell functions. Its role in memory formation is currently unknown. In this study, we show that NKG2D controls formation of CD8 memory T cells by promoting survival of precursor cells. We demonstrate that NKG2D enhances IL-15-mediated PI3K signaling of activated CD8 T cells, in a specific phase of memory cell commitment, after activation but before terminal differentiation. This signal is essential for the induction of prosurvival protein Mcl-1 and precursor cell survival. In vivo, NKG2D deficiency results in reduced memory cell formation and impaired protection against reinfection. Our findings show a new role for PI3K and the NKG2D/IL-15 axis in an underappreciated stage of effector to memory cell transition that is essential for the generation of antiviral immunity. Moreover, we provide novel insights how these receptors control both effector and memory T cell differentiation.","['Wensveen, Felix M', 'Lenartic, Maja', 'Jelencic, Vedrana', 'Lemmermann, Niels A W', 'ten Brinke, Anja', 'Jonjic, Stipan', 'Polic, Bojan']","['Wensveen FM', 'Lenartic M', 'Jelencic V', 'Lemmermann NA', 'ten Brinke A', 'Jonjic S', 'Polic B']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Hcst protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/immunology/prevention & control', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,,,2013/06/28 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1300670 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1300670 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Aug 1;191(3):1307-15. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300670.

Transendothelial migration (TEM) of normal lymphocytes into lymph nodes requires the chemokine-induced activation of Rap1 and alphaLbeta2 integrin. However, in most cases of CLL, Rap1 is refractory to chemokine stimulation, resulting in failed alphaLbeta2 activation and TEM unless alpha4beta1 is coexpressed. In this study, we show that the inability of CXCL12 to induce Rap1 GTP loading in CLL cells results from failure of Rap1-containing endosomes to translocate to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, failure of chemokine-induced Rap1 translocation/GTP loading was associated with a specific pattern of cellular IgD distribution resembling that observed in normal B cells anergized by DNA-based Ags. Anergic features and chemokine unresponsiveness could be simultaneously reversed by culturing CLL cells ex vivo, suggesting that these two features are coupled and driven by stimuli present in the in vivo microenvironment. Finally, we show that failure of Rap1 translocation/GTP loading is linked to defective activation of phospholipase D1 and its upstream activator Arf1. Taken together, our findings indicate that chemokine unresponsiveness in CLL lymphocytes results from failure of Arf1/phospholipase D1-mediated translocation of Rap1 to the plasma membrane for GTP loading and may be a specific feature of anergy induced by DNA Ags.","['Pye, Derek S', 'Rubio, Ignacio', 'Pusch, Rico', 'Lin, Ke', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Till, Kathleen J']","['Pye DS', 'Rubio I', 'Pusch R', 'Lin K', 'Pettitt AR', 'Till KJ']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2IP protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (phospholipase D1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RAP2A protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Clonal Anergy/*immunology', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rap GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis']",,,,2013/06/28 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1203484 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1203484 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Aug 1;191(3):1496-504. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1203484.

To improve ethacrynic acid activity, ethacrynic acid oxadiazole analogs 6s and 6u were synthesized. Although both compounds have greater antiproliferative effects than ethacrynic acid in human HL-60 cells, 6u has a reduced ability to inhibit GSTP1-1 activity. The mechanisms of both 6s- and 6u-induced cell death as well as the role of GSTP1-1 in their actions were studied. Both 6s and 6u equally induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells due to the activation of caspase-3, -9, and -8, which was correlated with the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and XIAP. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked the reduction of XIAP, but not of c-FLIP and Mcl-1, in 6s-treated cells. The reduction of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 by 6s was not blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, but was correlated with inhibition of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and eIF4E. Both 6s and 6u decreased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. N-acetylcysteine blocked reduction in the levels of Mcl-1, c-FLIP, and intracellular GSH as well as apoptosis in HL-60 cells treated by either compound. Silencing of GSTP1-1 in K562 cells sensitized, but overexpression of GSTP1-1 in Raji cells blocked, apoptosis induction by either compound. GSH conjugation at the methylene group abrogated the ability of inducing apoptosis. These data suggest that the methylene group plays an important role in the downregulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 proteins and apoptosis induction, which is inactivated by GSTP1-1 by forming GSH conjugates.","['Liu, Guyue', 'Wang, Rui', 'Wang, Yuetong', 'Li, Pengzhan', 'Zhao, Guisen', 'Zhao, Linxiang', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Liu G', 'Wang R', 'Wang Y', 'Li P', 'Zhao G', 'Zhao L', 'Jing Y']","['Corresponding Author: Yongkui Jing, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Box 1178, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

However, the prognostic significance for these gene alterations has not been clarified in Japanese patients. PROCEDURE: A total of 194 patients with BCP-ALL enrolled in the Japanese Children's Cancer & Leukemia Study Group ALL 2004 clinical trial were assessed for the presence of three different gene alterations: IKZF1 deletions, CRLF2 expression and JAK2 mutation. RESULTS: IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2-high expression were identified in 22 of 177 (12%) patients and in 15 of 141 (11%) patients, respectively. However, JAK2 R683 mutation was detected only one of 177 patients. The 4-year event-free survival (4y-EFS) was different when comparing patients with or without IKZF1 deletions (68.2% vs. 85.2%; P = 0.04) and was also different when comparing patients with different CRLF2 expression levels (high, 66.7% vs. low, 88.1%; P = 0.03). The differences in 4y-EFS were statistically significant in patients with ALL in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-high risk group (HR-ALL) (IKZF1 deletions: yes, 58.3% vs. no, 87.0%, P = 0.02; CRLF2 expression: high, 55.6% vs. low, 85.3%, P = 0.04) but not in patients with ALL in the NCI-standard risk group (SR-ALL; IKZF1 deletions: yes, 80.0% vs. no, 84.4%, P = 0.75; CRLF2 expression: high, 83.3% vs. low, 89.2%, P = 0.77). Coexistence of IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2-high expression associated with poor outcomes.

This study for the first time explored the reduced expression of PLZF and its effects in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carcinogenesis. PLZF was found to be down-regulated by 62.8% in 87.1% of 154 paired NSCLC samples by quantitative real-time PCR, and its expression was found to be associated with the sex of the patient (P=0.02). Further analysis showed that down-regulation of PLZF in 35.6% NSCLC samples (31 out of 87) was triggered by hypermethylation in the promoter region. This was validated by demethylation analysis using the A549 cell line. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that CTCF binding to the promoter region could activate PLZF transcription. Overexpression of PLZF in both A549 and LTEP lung cancer cell lines was found to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis. Therefore, reduced expression of PLZF was found to be common in NSCLC. PLZF down-regulation was partially correlated with hypermethylation in the promoter region. Decreased levels of PLZF expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC by promoting cell survival. Therefore, the restoration of PLZF expression may serve as a new strategy for NSCLC therapy.","['Wang, Xiaotian', 'Wang, Lei', 'Guo, Shicheng', 'Bao, Yang', 'Ma, Yanyun', 'Yan, Fengyang', 'Xu, Kuan', 'Xu, Zhiyun', 'Jin, Li', 'Lu, Daru', 'Xu, Jibin', 'Wang, Jiu-Cun']","['Wang X', 'Wang L', 'Guo S', 'Bao Y', 'Ma Y', 'Yan F', 'Xu K', 'Xu Z', 'Jin L', 'Lu D', 'Xu J', 'Wang JC']","['2J.-C.W., National Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China. jcwang@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BSP', 'MSP']",2013/06/28 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.13-229070 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.13-229070 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2013 Oct;27(10):4194-203. doi: 10.1096/fj.13-229070.

Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) use the antibody variable segments to direct specificity against cell surface molecules. T-cell receptors (TCR) can redirect T cells to intracellular target proteins, fragments of which are presented in the peptide-binding groove of HLA molecules. A recent clinical trial with CAR-modified T cells redirected against the B-cell lineage antigen CD19 showed dramatic clinical benefit in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Similarly, impressive clinical responses were seen in melanoma and synovial cell carcinoma with TCR-modified T cells redirected against the melanocyte lineage antigen MART-1 and the testis-cancer antigen NY-ESO-1. However, on and off-target toxicity was associated with most of these clinical responses, and fatal complications have been observed in some patients treated with gene modified T cells. This review will discuss factors that might contribute to toxic side effects of therapy with gene modified T cells, and outline potential strategies to retain anticancer activity while reducing unwanted side effects.","['Stauss, H J', 'Morris, E C']","['Stauss HJ', 'Morris EC']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130627,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Engineering', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects/methods', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",,,,2013/06/28 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201334 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2013.34 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2013 Nov;20(11):1029-32. doi: 10.1038/gt.2013.34.

A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behaviour or fail. Here we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behaviour. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task, as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure-which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signalling network of human cancer.","['Cornelius, Sean P', 'Kath, William L', 'Motter, Adilson E']","['Cornelius SP', 'Kath WL', 'Motter AE']","['Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,,IM,"['Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Power Plants', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",PMC3955710,,,2013/06/28 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms2939 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms2939 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Commun. 2013;4:1942. doi: 10.1038/ncomms2939.,"['U54 CA143869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1U54CA143869-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS554156'],,,,,,,,

Activating mutations in c-Kit lead to alteration of these cellular processes and have been implicated in many human cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, testicular seminomas and mastocytosis. Regulation of the catalytic activity of several kinases is known to be governed by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain. However, in the case of c-Kit phosphorylation of Tyr-823 has been demonstrated to be a late event that is not required for kinase activation. However, because phosphorylation of Tyr-823 is a ligand-activated event, we sought to investigate the functional consequences of Tyr-823 phosphorylation. By using a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant of tyrosine 823, we investigated the impact of Tyr-823 on c-Kit signaling. We demonstrate here that Tyr-823 is crucial for cell survival and proliferation and that mutation of Tyr-823 to phenylalanine leads to decreased sustained phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Kit as compared with the wild-type receptor. Furthermore, the mutated receptor was, upon ligand-stimulation, quickly internalized and degraded. Phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl was transient, followed by a substantial reduction in phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules such as Akt, Erk, p38, Shc, and Gab2. Thus, we propose that activation loop tyrosine 823 is crucial for activation of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways and that its disruption leads to a destabilization of the c-Kit receptor and decreased survival of cells.","['Agarwal, Shruti', 'Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Agarwal S', 'Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Survival', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC3829335,['NOTNLM'],"['Activation Loop', 'Cbl', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Growth Factors', 'MAP Kinases (MAPKs)', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase', 'Ubiquitination', 'c-Kit']",2013/06/28 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45410-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.474072 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Aug 2;288(31):22460-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.474072.

In the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ANGPT2 causes vessel destabilization leading to neoangiogenesis. Accordingly, high expression levels of ANGPT2 and high degree of angiogenesis have consistently been associated with poor prognosis in CLL; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the variability in ANGPT2 expression are still to be discovered. Here, for the first time, we investigated the DNA methylation status of the ANGPT2 promoter in a large CLL cohort (n = 88) using pyrosequencing and correlated methylation data with ANGPT2 expression levels, prognostic factors and outcome. Importantly, methylation levels of the ANGPT2 gene correlated inversely with its mRNA expression levels (p<0.001). Moreover, low ANGPT2 methylation status was highly associated with adverse prognostic markers, shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. Finally, treatment with methyl inhibitors induced re-expression of ANGPT2 in two B-cell lymphoma cell lines, underscoring the importance of DNA methylation in regulating transcriptional silencing of this gene. In conclusion, we believe that the known variability in ANGPT2 expression among CLL patients could be explained by differential promoter DNA methylation and that low methylation levels of the ANGPT2 promoter have an adverse prognostic impact in CLL.","['Martinelli, Silvia', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Bulgarelli, Jenny', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Martinelli S', 'Kanduri M', 'Maffei R', 'Fiorcari S', 'Bulgarelli J', 'Marasca R', 'Rosenquist R']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130514,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (ANGPT2 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiopoietin-2/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cohort Studies', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",PMC3781191,['NOTNLM'],"['ANGPT2', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'gene methylation', 'prognosis', 'pyrosequencing']",2013/06/28 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['24947 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.24947 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2013 Jul;8(7):720-9. doi: 10.4161/epi.24947.

However, little is known about effects of DZNep on ovarian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We here therefore studied DZNep-treated A2780 ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Proliferation of ovarian cancer cells under treatment of DZNep was assessed by MTT and apoptosis by flow cytometry. Cell wound healing was applied to detect the migration. Finally, we used q-PCR to assess the migration-related gene, E-cadherin. RESULTS: DZNep could inhibit the proliferation of A2780 and induce apoptosis Furthermore, it inhibited migration and increased the expression of E-cadherin (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: DZNep is a promising therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer cells, with potential to inhibite proliferation, induce apoptosis and decrease migration.","['Shen, Liang', 'Cui, Jing', 'Pang, Ying-Xin', 'Ma, Yan-Hui', 'Liu, Pei-Shu']","['Shen L', 'Cui J', 'Pang YX', 'Ma YH', 'Liu PS']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MTF2 protein, human)', '544SH4020S (3-deazaneplanocin)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cadherins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,2013/06/28 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2013/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.5.2915 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2013;14(5):2915-8. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.5.2915.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay and cell cycle profiles were demonstrated by staining with propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was confirmed by staining with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was determined by staining with dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide and flow cytometry and expression of Smac, caspase-8 and -9 was demonstrated by Western blotting. Goniothalamin inhibited growth of HL-60 and U937 cell lines. An increase of SubG1 phase was found in their cell cycle profiles, indicating apoptosis as the mode of cell death. Apoptosis was confirmed by the flip-flop of phosphatidylserine using annexin V-FITC/PI assay in HL60 and U937 cells in a dose response manner. Furthermore, reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was found in both cell types while expression of caspase-8, -9 and Smac/Diablo was increased in HL-60 cells.

Many of these hormones and cytokines are altered in obese individuals and may lead to disruption of the normal balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The aim of our work was to investigate the disturbance of secretion of adiponectin and resistin in de novo and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Egyptian children and determine whether adiponectin and resistin are implicated in increased risk relapse compared to healthy individuals. METHODS: Measurements of adiponectin and resistin were performed at diagnosis, in 32 patients with de novo ALL aged 3 to 18 years (mean 9.8 y) and 19 children with relapsed ALL aged 5 to 17 (mean 9.9 yr). 10 apparently healthy children with matched age and sex were used as controls. RESULTS: Mean adiponectin levels were low (P < 0.05), whereas mean resistin levels were high (P<0.05) at diagnosis and relapsed ALL (compared to healthy controls). A significant decrease of adiponectin levels was observed in relapsed ALL compared to de novo ALL. In contrast resistin was significantly increased in relapsed ALL compared to de novo patients. Adiponectin in ALL subjects inversely correlated with resistin level (r = -0.51, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Low adiponectin and high resistin level at diagnosis suggest their implication in ALL pathogenesis and may serve as potential clinically significant diagnostic markers to detect leukemic relapse.","['El-Baz, Hatim A', 'Mosa, Tamer E', 'Elabd, Elham M', 'Ramadan, Amal', 'Elharoun, Ahmed S', 'Elmorsy, Elsayed A', 'Fouda, Manal I']","['El-Baz HA', 'Mosa TE', 'Elabd EM', 'Ramadan A', 'Elharoun AS', 'Elmorsy EA', 'Fouda MI']","['Dept. of Biochemistry, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt ; Dept. of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, North Jeddah Branch, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130501,Iran,Iran J Public Health,Iranian journal of public health,7505531,,,,PMC3684459,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adiponectin', 'Resistin']",2013/06/27 06:00,2013/06/27 06:01,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/27 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Iran J Public Health. 2013 May 1;42(5):504-10.

With characteristics such as high stability, low cost, possibility of repeated sampling and minimal invasiveness, circulating miRNAs are ideal for development into diagnostic tests. There have been many studies reported on the potential of circulating miRNAs as early detection, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in cancer. Here, we have reviewed the application of plasma and serum miRNAs as biomarkers for cancer focusing on epithelial carcinomas [prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, and gastric cancer (GC)] and hematological malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma).

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor. The current perspective discusses the use of the term CIMP in cancer, its significance in clinical practice, and future directions that may aid in identifying the true cause and definition of CIMP in different forms of human neoplasia.","['Hughes, Laura A E', 'Melotte, Veerle', 'de Schrijver, Joachim', 'de Maat, Michiel', 'Smit, Vincent T H B M', 'Bovee, Judith V M G', 'French, Pim J', 'van den Brandt, Piet A', 'Schouten, Leo J', 'de Meyer, Tim', 'van Criekinge, Wim', 'Ahuja, Nita', 'Herman, James G', 'Weijenberg, Matty P', 'van Engeland, Manon']","['Hughes LA', 'Melotte V', 'de Schrijver J', 'de Maat M', 'Smit VT', 'Bovee JV', 'French PJ', 'van den Brandt PA', 'Schouten LJ', 'de Meyer T', 'van Criekinge W', 'Ahuja N', 'Herman JG', 'Weijenberg MP', 'van Engeland M']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Departments of Epidemiology and Pathology, GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht; Department of Surgery, Orbis Medical Center, Sittard-Geleen; Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Mathematical Modeling, Statistics and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; and The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-4306 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4306 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 1;73(19):5858-68. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4306.

However, it is not known whether FMNL1 contributes to leukemogenesis. Here, we investigate the FMNL1 function using two different human leukemia models: Namalwa and K562 cell lines. FMNL1 depletion reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in both leukemic cell types, as well as a decrease in the tumor growth of FMNL1-depleted Namalwa cell xenografts. In addition, there was a decrease in migration and in TEM in FMNL1-depleted Namalwa cells. FMNL1 endogenously associates with Rac1, and FMNL1 silencing resulted in an increased Rac1 activity. The reduced migration observed in FMNL1-depleted cells was restored by inhibiting Rac activity. Our results indicate that FMNL1 stimulates leukemia cell proliferation as well as migration. This suggests that FMNL1 contributes to leukemogenesis and could act in part through Rac1 regulation.","['Favaro, Patricia', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Lazarini, Mariana', 'Lopes, Matheus Rodrigues', 'Pereira, Joao Kleber Novais', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira', 'Infante, Elvira', 'Ridley, Anne J', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla']","['Favaro P', 'Traina F', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Lazarini M', 'Lopes MR', 'Pereira JK', 'Costa FF', 'Infante E', 'Ridley AJ', 'Saad ST']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil. patricia.favaro@unifesp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (FMNL1 protein, human)', '0 (Formins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*physiology', 'Formins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Rac1', 'cell motility', 'formins', 'leukemogenesis', 'transendothelial migration']",2013/06/27 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0113057 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0113057 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2013 Sep;94(3):503-12. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0113057.

To assess the importance of this downregulation, we generated a mouse line (R26-betacat) in which high levels of active beta-catenin are maintained throughout T-cell development. Young R26-betacat mice show a differentiation block at the CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) stage. These DP cells exhibit impaired apoptosis upon irradiation or dexamethasone treatment. All R26-betacat mice develop T-cell leukemias at 5 to 6 months of age. R26-betacat leukemias remain dependent on beta-catenin function but lack Notch pathway activation. They exhibit recurrent secondary genomic rearrangements that lead to Myc overexpression and loss of Pten activity. Because beta-catenin activation and Myc translocations were previously found in murine T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) deficient for Pten, our results suggest that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is associated with a subtype of Notch-independent T-ALLs that bear Myc gene rearrangements and Pten mutations.","['Kaveri, Deepika', 'Kastner, Philippe', 'Dembele, Doulaye', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Chan, Susan', 'Kirstetter, Peggy']","['Kaveri D', 'Kastner P', 'Dembele D', 'Nerlov C', 'Chan S', 'Kirstetter P']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, INSERM U964, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/physiology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics/physiology', 'beta Catenin/agonists/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56036-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-471904 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 1;122(5):694-704. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-471904.

Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness; thus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic and small molecule inhibitor studies have demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged leukemia in model systems. Here we describe the characterization of EPZ-5676, a potent and selective aminonucleoside inhibitor of DOT1L histone methyltransferase activity. The compound has an inhibition constant value of 80 pM, and demonstrates 37 000-fold selectivity over all other methyltransferases tested. In cellular studies, EPZ-5676 inhibited H3K79 methylation and MLL-fusion target gene expression and demonstrated potent cell killing that was selective for acute leukemia lines bearing MLL translocations. Continuous IV infusion of EPZ-5676 in a rat xenograft model of MLL-rearranged leukemia caused complete tumor regressions that were sustained well beyond the compound infusion period with no significant weight loss or signs of toxicity. EPZ-5676 is therefore a potential treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia and is under clinical investigation.","['Daigle, Scott R', 'Olhava, Edward J', 'Therkelsen, Carly A', 'Basavapathruni, Aravind', 'Jin, Lei', 'Boriack-Sjodin, P Ann', 'Allain, Christina J', 'Klaus, Christine R', 'Raimondi, Alejandra', 'Scott, Margaret Porter', 'Waters, Nigel J', 'Chesworth, Richard', 'Moyer, Mikel P', 'Copeland, Robert A', 'Richon, Victoria M', 'Pollock, Roy M']","['Daigle SR', 'Olhava EJ', 'Therkelsen CA', 'Basavapathruni A', 'Jin L', 'Boriack-Sjodin PA', 'Allain CJ', 'Klaus CR', 'Raimondi A', 'Scott MP', 'Waters NJ', 'Chesworth R', 'Moyer MP', 'Copeland RA', 'Richon VM', 'Pollock RM']","['Epizyme, Inc., 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130625,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (EPZ-5676)', '0 (Histones)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (DOT1L protein, rat)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*therapy', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude']",PMC3739029,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56008-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-04-497644 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 8;122(6):1017-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-04-497644.

In vitro studies suggested that metabolism of ponatinib is partially mediated by CYP3A4. The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib and its CYP3A4-mediated metabolite, AP24567, were evaluated in a single-center, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study in healthy volunteers. Subjects (N = 22) received two single doses (orally) of ponatinib 15 mg, once given alone and once coadministered with daily (5 days) ketoconazole 400 mg, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ponatinib plus ketoconazole increased ponatinib maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with ponatinib alone. The estimated mean ratios for AUC0-infinity, AUC0-t, and C(max) indicated increased exposures to ponatinib of 78%, 70%, and 47%, respectively; exposure to AP24567 decreased by 71%.

These results suggest that caution should be exercised with the concurrent use of ponatinib and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and that a ponatinib dose decrease to 30 mg daily, from the 45 mg daily starting dose, could be considered.","['Narasimhan, Narayana I', 'Dorer, David J', 'Niland, Katie', 'Haluska, Frank', 'Sonnichsen, Daryl']","['Narasimhan NI', 'Dorer DJ', 'Niland K', 'Haluska F', 'Sonnichsen D']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. narayana.narasimhan@ariad.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', '*Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Ketoconazole/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3781849,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'ketoconazole', 'pharmacokinetics', 'ponatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcph.109 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Sep;53(9):974-81. doi: 10.1002/jcph.109.

In order to clarify the clinical features and actual management of MCD in Japan, we analyzed 21 patients diagnosed with MCD and treated in Kyoto University Hospital between 2005 and 2012. There were 12 men and 9 women. The median age at disease onset was 46 years, and the median follow-up period was 98 months. Common symptoms included splenomegaly (13/20), renal dysfunction (11/21), interstitial pneumonia (7/21), pleural effusion and/or ascites (7/21), and thrombocytopenia (6/21). The results of the anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody and human herpes virus-8 DNA tests in the blood were available in 13 and 5 cases, respectively, and no patient was positive for either. Among 12 patients treated with tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, 11 exhibited an improvement in MCD-related symptoms and 3 achieved complete resolution of all these symptoms. In 8 patients treated with tocilizumab for over 1 year, the mean Hb level increased from 7.4 to 12.2 g/dL while the mean serum C-reactive protein level decreased from 13.2 to 0.4 mg/dL. Three patients died during the observation period due to sepsis, secondary leukemia, or pancreatic cancer. The clinical courses of most cases were indolent; however, in some cases with pleural effusion, ascites, renal dysfunction, and/or thrombocytopenia, the disease manifestation was serious.

The simultaneous presentation of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma in the same patient is a very rare phenomenon and, so far, only two cases have been described. We report the case of a 75-year Caucasian female patient, with a silent clinical history, who presented with anemia and two different monoclonal proteins (IgMkappa and IgGkappa). The trephine biopsy showed the presence of a dual population, represented by small lymphoplasmacytoid cells and by plasma cells, which infiltrated the bone marrow with a clearly different pattern. Both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry demonstrated the biclonal origin such neoplastic cells, since lymphoplasmacytoid cells resulted IgMkappa while plasma cells were IgGkappa. This biclonal pattern was further confirmed by the demonstration of a different IgH gene rearrangement of the two neoplasms. The patient was treated with bortezomib, dexamethasone and rituximab, achieving partial remission of both Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma. After a 30-month follow-up, she is in stable disease. Multiple myeloma has been described in association with other indolent B-cell neoplasms, mostly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can be followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in some instances, after chemotherapy. The association of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma seems to be very rare. Our study shows that an integrated diagnostic work-up is very useful in such cases, with an interesting role for flow cytometry.

The vast majority of previously reported HSs are now generally recognized to be misdiagnosed examples of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, predominantly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The recognition of such tumors parallels the development and widespread use of immunohistochemical techniques, along with the development of molecular genetic methods to detect immunoglobulin (IG) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. The 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) definition of HS requires the absence of clonal B/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. However, the 2008 WHO classification no longer strictly requires the absence of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) or TCR gene rearrangement for the diagnosis of HS. Recent studies demonstrated that HSs that occur subsequent to or concurrent with B- or T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia or mature B-cell neoplasms generally show clonal IgH and/or TCR gene rearrangement. These findings suggest the possibility of transdifferentiation of the two otherwise morphologically and immunohistochemically distinctive neoplasms. In addition, a recent study suggested clonal IG gene rearrangements may be detected at a high frequency in sporadic HS, indicating that a large subset of sporadic HSs may inherit the B-lymphocyte genotype. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HS, although the etiology of HS is still unknown. HS is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is necessary to rule out other diseases that could be misdiagnosed as HS with extensive immunophenotypical analysis before diagnosing HS.","['Takahashi, Emiko', 'Nakamura, Shigeo']","['Takahashi E', 'Nakamura S']","['Department of Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,IM,"['Histiocytic Sarcoma/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Molecular Biology', 'World Health Organization']",,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/53.1 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.53.1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2013;53(1):1-8. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.53.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Fes, PU.1 and MCSFR were down-regulated by over-expression of miR-125b (unpublished work), a similar effect of miR-424 and Fes siRNA on CD64, Egr-1, Egr-2 and CEBPA indicates that Fes may be an important downstream target of miR-424.

Muscarinic receptors are relatively abundant in the central nervous system and in the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Several studies have suggested that muscarinic receptors also mediate some cellular events in hematopoietic cells. K562 erythroleukemia cells contain muscarinic receptors M2, M3 and M4, and activation of muscarinic receptors changes cell proliferation. We examined the effects of several compounds on cell proliferation in K562 erythroleukemia cells. These included a muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh), a protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine; the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, the MEK 1-2 inhibitor UO126, the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the Ca(2+) chelators BAPTA/AM and 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2APB). In addition, we also investigated muscarinic receptor mediated protein kinase C (PKC) expression in K562 cells. CCh caused a decrease in DNA synthesis in K562 cells supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum after starvation. Pre-treatment of K562 cells with U73122 and BAPTA/AM antagonized the inhibitory effect of CCh, suggesting that phospholipase C and intracellular calcium are involved in CCh-mediated inhibition of proliferation in K562 cells. Our data also suggest that the regulatory roles of protein kinase C and the MAPK/ERK pathways in K562 cell proliferation are independent of cholinergic activation.","['Aydin, Banu', 'Kan, Beki', 'Cabadak, Hulya']","['Aydin B', 'Kan B', 'Cabadak H']","['Department of Biophysics, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130622,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Cholinergic Agonists)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (U 0126)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholinergic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Atropine', 'Carbachol', 'Cell signaling', 'Leukemia cell line', 'Muscarinic receptors', 'PKC']",2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(13)00184-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2013.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Sep;37(9):1144-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2013.05.018.

Coli.,284,10.1186/1471-2334-13-284 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Ambulatory consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently associated with bloodstream infections but the spectrum of bacterial pathogens in this setting has not been well-described. METHODS: We evaluated the emergence of bacteremias and their respective antibiotic susceptibility patterns in AML patients receiving ambulatory-based consolidation therapy. Following achievement of complete remission, 207 patients received the first cycle (C1), and 195 the second cycle (C2), of consolidation on an ambulatory basis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and fluconazole. RESULTS: There were significantly more positive blood cultures for E. coli in C2 as compared to C1 (10 vs. 1, p=0.0045); all E. coli strains for which susceptibility testing was performed demonstrated resistance to ciprofloxacin. In patients under age 60 there was a significantly higher rate of Streptococccus spp. bacteremia in C2 vs. C1; despite amoxicillin prophylaxis all Streptococcus isolates in C2 were sensitive to penicillin. Patients with Staphylococcus bacteremia in C1 had significantly higher rates of Staphylococcus bacteremia in C2 (p=0.009, OR=8.6). CONCLUSIONS: For AML patients undergoing outpatient-based intensive consolidation chemotherapy with antibiotic prophylaxis, the second cycle is associated with higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli, penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus bacteremias and recurrent Staphylococcus infections.","['Saini, Lalit', 'Rostein, Coleman', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Brandwein, Joseph M']","['Saini L', 'Rostein C', 'Atenafu EG', 'Brandwein JM']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, 610 University Avenue, Rm. 5-109, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130622,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteremia/*microbiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Fluoroquinolones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC3694510,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-13-284 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-13-284 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2013 Jun 22;13:284. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-13-284.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the response of human patients to cancer treatments is often evaluated using cytogenetic techniques, this approach has not been used for dogs with comparable neoplasias. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of cytogenetic techniques to evaluate the cytogenetic response of canine leukemia to chemotherapy. Cytology and flow cytometric techniques were used to diagnose chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in a dog. High-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (oaCGH) and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed to identify and characterize DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) and targeted structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood WBC at the time of diagnosis and following one week of chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis, oaCGH indicated the presence of 22 distinct CNAs, of which trisomy of dog chromosome 7 (CFA 7) was the most evident. FISH analysis revealed that this CNA was present in 42% of leukemic cells; in addition, a breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) translocation was evident in 17.3% of cells. After one week of treatment, the percentage of cells affected by trisomy of CFA7 and BCR-ABL translocation was reduced to 2% and 3.3%, respectively. Chromosome aberrations in canine leukemic cells may be monitored by molecular cytogenetic techniques to demonstrate cytogenetic remission following treatment. Further understanding of the genetic aberrations involved in canine leukemia may be crucial to improve treatment protocols.","['Culver, Sarah', 'Ito, Daisuke', 'Borst, Luke', 'Bell, Jerold S', 'Modiano, Jaime F', 'Breen, Matthew']","['Culver S', 'Ito D', 'Borst L', 'Bell JS', 'Modiano JF', 'Breen M']","['Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/veterinary', 'Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/veterinary', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",PMC4501037,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosome', 'cytogenetics', 'hematopoietic cells', 'remission', 'vincristine']",2013/06/27 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vcp.12055 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2013 Sep;42(3):314-22. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12055.

The pathogenesis of infection in patients with this leukemia is complex and multifactorial. Patients with CLL have a number of immune system defects, including disordered B-cell function with decreased production of normal B-cells and abnormal production of immunoglobulins, suppressed T-cell function and neutropenia. Other immune abnormalities present in CLL patients include neutrophil dysfunction, and complement deficiencies. In addition, further perturbations in immune function are related to the antileukemic therapies. Immune disturbance might be common prior to CLL diagnosis and infectious agents could trigger CLL development. Current chemotherapy-based regimens are not curative and often worsen this immune suppression. The introduction of new effective therapeutic agents such as the purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies has influenced the spectrum of infections diagnosed in CLL patients. Some conditions increase the risk for the development of infections including advanced age, decreased levels of immunoglobulins, advanced Binet stage, neutropenia and treatment with more than one line of chemotherapy. Until now it is debatable whether and when antibacterial prophylaxis could be useful in CLL patients. The prevention of infection includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, as well as immunoglobulin replacement and vaccination. Antibacterial prophylaxis should be given to CLL patients with previous severe and/or relapsing bacterial infections. This article reviews the immune defects in CLL and discusses strategies aimed at prophylaxis and treatment of infections in patients with CLL.","['Stelmach, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Stelmach P', 'Robak T']","['Klinika Hematologii, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lodzi i Wojewodzki Szpital Specjalistyczny im M Kopernika w Lodzi, Lodz.']",['pol'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130620,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/etiology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization/methods', 'Immunoglobulins/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/drug therapy/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Active', 'Infections/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Virus Diseases/etiology/prevention & control']",,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1053901 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1053901 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 Jun 20;67:560-8. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1053901.,,,,"Klinika Hematologii, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lodzi i Wojewodzki Szpital Specjalistyczny im M Kopernika w Lodzi.",,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, similar progress has not been made in treatment response criteria, with the definition of 'complete remission' in AML largely unchanged for over half a century. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that high-sensitivity measurements of residual disease burden during or after treatment can be performed, that results are predictive for clinical outcome and can be used to improve outcomes by guiding additional therapeutic intervention to patients in clinical complete remission, but at increased relapse risk. We review these recent trials, the characteristics and challenges of the modalities currently used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD), and outline opportunities to both refine detection and improve clinical use of MRD measurements. MRD measurement is already the standard of care in other myeloid malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia and acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). It is our belief that response criteria for non-APL AML should be updated to include assessment for molecular complete remission and recommendations for post-consolidation surveillance should include regular monitoring for molecular relapse as standard of care.","['Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Hourigan CS', 'Karp JE']","['Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 10 Centre Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-1583, USA. hourigan@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20130625,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

The authors hypothesized that desflurane preconditioning would induce NF-kappaB oscillation and prevent endothelial cells apoptosis. METHODS: A human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) A/R injury model was used. A 30 minute desflurane treatment was initiated before anoxia. NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082 was administered in some experiments before desflurane preconditioning. Cells apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and cell viability was evaluated by modified tertrozalium salt (MTT) assay. The cellular superoxide dismutases (SOD) activitiy were tested by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. NF-kappaB p65 subunit nuclear translocation was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Expression of inhibitor of NF-kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha), NF-kappaB p65 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (c-IAP1), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cysteine containing aspartate specific protease 3 (caspases-3) and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (SMAC/DIABLO) were determined by western blot. RESULTS: Desflurane preconditioning caused phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB before anoxia, on the contrary, induced the synthesis of IkappaBalpha and inhibition of NF-kappaB after reoxygenation. Desflurane preconditioning up-regulated the expression of c-IAP1 and Bcl-2, blocked the cleavage of caspase-3 and reduced SMAC release, and decreased the cell death of HUVECs after A/R. The protective effect was abolished by BAY11-7082 administered before desflurane. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that desflurane activated NF-kappaB during the preconditioning period and inhibited excessive activation of NF-kappaB in reperfusion. And the oscillation of NF-kappaB induced by desflurane preconditioning finally up-regulated antiapoptotic proteins expression and protected endothelial cells against A/R.","['Yi, Juan', 'Zheng, Yijun', 'Miao, Changhong', 'Tang, Jianguo', 'Zhu, Biao']","['Yi J', 'Zheng Y', 'Miao C', 'Tang J', 'Zhu B']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Anesthetics, Inhalation)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', 'CRS35BZ94Q (Desflurane)', 'CYS9AKD70P (Isoflurane)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Inhalation/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Desflurane', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Isoflurane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Proteolysis', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",PMC3684570,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066576 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-06838 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 17;8(6):e66576. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066576.

METHODS: We developed a multi-state model describing simultaneously the likelihood of empirical antifungal therapy and the risk of invasive aspergillosis during neutropenia. We evaluated whether the first positive test result with a biomarker is an independent predictor of invasive aspergillosis when both diagnostic information used to treat and risk factors of developing invasive aspergillosis are taken into account over time. We applied the multi-state model to a homogeneous cohort of 185 high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Patients were prospectively screened for galactomannan antigenemia twice a week for immediate treatment decision; 2,214 serum samples were collected on the same days and blindly assessed for (1->3)- beta-D-glucan antigenemia and a quantitative PCR assay targeting a mitochondrial locus. RESULTS: The usual evaluation framework of biomarker performance was unable to distinguish clinical benefits of beta-glucan or PCR assays. The multi-state model evidenced that the risk of invasive aspergillosis is a complex time function of neutropenia duration and risk management. The quantitative PCR assay accelerated the early detection of invasive aspergillosis (P = .010), independently of other diagnostic information used to treat, while beta-glucan assay did not (P = .53). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of serum biomarkers for the early detection of invasive aspergillosis is better apprehended by the evaluation of time-varying predictors in a multi-state model. Our results provide strong rationale for prospective studies testing a preemptive antifungal therapy, guided by clinical, radiological, and bi-weekly blood screening with galactomannan antigenemia and a standardized quantitative PCR assay.","['Schwarzinger, Michael', 'Sagaon-Teyssier, Luis', 'Cabaret, Odile', 'Bretagne, Stephane', 'Cordonnier, Catherine']","['Schwarzinger M', 'Sagaon-Teyssier L', 'Cabaret O', 'Bretagne S', 'Cordonnier C']","['Equipe ATIP/AVENIR, INSERM, UMR 738, Paris, France. michael.schwarzinger@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130614,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Fungal Polysaccharides)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, Fungal/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*blood/immunology', 'DNA, Fungal/blood/genetics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fungal Polysaccharides/*blood', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mannans/*blood', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta-Glucans/blood']",PMC3683047,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0065776 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-39185 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 14;8(6):e65776. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0065776.

Here, we describe a previously unsuspected role for CXCR4 as a potent inducer of apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and a subset of clinical AML samples. We show that SDF-1, the sole ligand for CXCR4, induces the expected migration and ERK activation in the KG1a AML cell line transiently overexpressing CXCR4, but ERK activation did not lead to survival. Instead, SDF-1 treatment led via a CXCR4-dependent mechanism to apoptosis, as evidenced by increased annexin V staining, condensation of chromatin, and cleavage of both procaspase-3 and PARP. This SDF-1-induced death pathway was partially inhibited by hypoxia, which is often found in the bone marrow of AML patients. SDF-1-induced apoptosis was inhibited by dominant negative procaspase-9 but not by inhibition of caspase-8 activation, implicating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Further analysis showed that this pathway was activated by multiple mechanisms, including up-regulation of Bak at the level of mRNA and protein, stabilization of the Bak activator Noxa, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-XL. Furthermore, adjusting expression levels of Bak, Bcl-XL, or Noxa individually altered the level of apoptosis in AML cells, suggesting that the combined modulation of these family members by SDF-1 coordinates their interplay to produce apoptosis. Thus, rather than mediating survival, SDF-1 may be a means to induce apoptosis of CXCR4-expressing AML cells directly in the SDF-1-rich bone marrow microenvironment if the survival cues of the bone marrow are disrupted.","['Kremer, Kimberly N', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Meng, X Wei', 'Dai, Haiming', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Rodriguez-Ramirez, Christie', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Hedin, Karen E']","['Kremer KN', 'Peterson KL', 'Schneider PA', 'Meng XW', 'Dai H', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Rodriguez-Ramirez C', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Hedin KE']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/genetics/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3743469,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2 Family Proteins', 'CXCL12', 'CXCR4', 'Cancer', 'Caspase', 'Chemokines', 'Leukemia', 'SDF-1']",2013/06/27 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45320-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.449926 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Aug 9;288(32):22899-914. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.449926.

Previous work has shown that there is reciprocal feedback regulation of PI3K and AR signaling in PCa, suggesting that cotargeting both pathways may enhance therapeutic efficacy. Here we show that proteins encoded by two androgen-regulated genes, kallikrein related peptidase 4 (KLK4) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), integrate optimal functioning of AR and mTOR signaling in PCa cells. KLK4 interacts with PLZF and decreases its stability. PLZF in turn interacts with AR and inhibits its function as a transcription factor. PLZF also activates expression of regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1, an inhibitor of mTORC1. Thus, a unique molecular switch is generated that regulates both AR and PI3K signaling. Consistently, KLK4 knockdown results in a significant decline in PCa cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, decreases anchorage-independent growth, induces apoptosis, and dramatically sensitizes PCa cells to apoptosis-inducing agents. Furthermore, in vivo nanoliposomal KLK4 siRNA delivery in mice bearing PCa tumors results in profound remission. These results demonstrate that the activities of AR and mTOR pathways are maintained by KLK4, which may thus be a viable target for therapy.","['Jin, Yang', 'Qu, Su', 'Tesikova, Martina', 'Wang, Ling', 'Kristian, Alexandr', 'Maelandsmo, Gunhild M', 'Kong, Haiying', 'Zhang, Tianzhou', 'Jeronimo, Carmen', 'Teixeira, Manuel R', 'Yuca, Erkan', 'Tekedereli, Ibrahim', 'Gorgulu, Kivanc', 'Alpay, Neslihan', 'Sood, Anil K', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel', 'Danielsen, Havard E', 'Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Saatcioglu, Fahri']","['Jin Y', 'Qu S', 'Tesikova M', 'Wang L', 'Kristian A', 'Maelandsmo GM', 'Kong H', 'Zhang T', 'Jeronimo C', 'Teixeira MR', 'Yuca E', 'Tekedereli I', 'Gorgulu K', 'Alpay N', 'Sood AK', 'Lopez-Berestein G', 'Danielsen HE', 'Ozpolat B', 'Saatcioglu F']","['Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Kallikreins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (kallikrein 4)']",IM,"['Androgens/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kallikreins/genetics/*physiology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3710885,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1304318110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1304318110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 9;110(28):E2572-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1304318110.

Here, we show that MLL5 is recruited to gene-rich euchromatic regions via the interaction of its plant homeodomain finger with the histone mark H3K4me3. The 1.48-A resolution crystal structure of MLL5 plant homeodomain in complex with the H3K4me3 peptide reveals a noncanonical binding mechanism, whereby K4me3 is recognized through a single aromatic residue and an aspartate. The binding induces a unique His-Asp swapping rearrangement mediated by a C-terminal alpha-helix. Phosphorylation of H3T3 and H3T6 abrogates the association with H3K4me3 in vitro and in vivo, releasing MLL5 from chromatin in mitosis. This regulatory switch is conserved in the Drosophila ortholog of MLL5, UpSET, and suggests the developmental control for targeting of H3K4me3. Together, our findings provide first insights into the molecular basis for the recruitment, exclusion, and regulation of MLL5 at chromatin.","['Ali, Muzaffar', 'Rincon-Arano, Hector', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Rothbart, Scott B', 'Tong, Qiong', 'Parkhurst, Susan M', 'Strahl, Brian D', 'Deng, Lih-Wen', 'Groudine, Mark', 'Kutateladze, Tatiana G']","['Ali M', 'Rincon-Arano H', 'Zhao W', 'Rothbart SB', 'Tong Q', 'Parkhurst SM', 'Strahl BD', 'Deng LW', 'Groudine M', 'Kutateladze TG']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2E protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",PMC3710826,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1310156110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1310156110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 9;110(28):11296-301. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310156110.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancies with various chromosomal and/or molecular abnormalities. AML with chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene are usually associated with poor survival. In the present study, through a large-scale, genomewide miRNA expression assay, we show that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is the most specifically up-regulated miRNA in MLL-rearranged AML compared with both normal control and non-MLL-rearranged AML. We demonstrate that miR-9 is a direct target of MLL fusion proteins and can be significantly up-regulated in expression by the latter in human and mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Depletion of endogenous miR-9 expression by an appropriate antagomiR can significantly inhibit cell growth/viability and promote apoptosis in human MLL-rearranged AML cells, and the opposite is true when expression of miR-9 is forced. Blocking endogenous miR-9 function by anti-miRNA sponge can significantly inhibit, whereas forced expression of miR-9 can significantly promote, MLL fusion-induced immortalization/transformation of normal mouse bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-9 can significantly promote MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. In addition, a group of putative target genes of miR-9 exhibited a significant inverse correlation of expression with miR-9 in a series of leukemia sample sets, suggesting that they are potential targets of miR-9 in MLL-rearranged AML. Collectively, our data demonstrate that miR-9 is a critical oncomiR in MLL-rearranged AML and can serve as a potential therapeutic target to treat this dismal disease.","['Chen, Ping', 'Price, Colles', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Cao, Donglin', 'Wiley, Anissa', 'He, Chunjiang', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Kunjamma, Rejani B', 'Huang, Hao', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Xu, Mengyi', 'Hong, Gia-Ming', 'Elkahloun, Abdel G', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Chen P', 'Price C', 'Li Z', 'Li Y', 'Cao D', 'Wiley A', 'He C', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Kunjamma RB', 'Huang H', 'Jiang X', 'Arnovitz S', 'Xu M', 'Hong GM', 'Elkahloun AG', 'Neilly MB', 'Wunderlich M', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Mulloy JC', 'Liu PP', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",PMC3710804,,,2013/06/27 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1310144110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1310144110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jul 9;110(28):11511-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310144110.

Although the endogenizing gammaretrovirus koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV) was isolated from these koalas, KoRV has not been definitively associated with leukemogenesis. We performed KoRV screening in koalas from the San Diego Zoo, maintained for more than 45 y with very limited outbreeding, and the Los Angeles Zoo, maintained by continuously assimilating captive-born Australian koalas. San Diego Zoo koalas are currently free of malignant neoplasias and were infected with only endogenous KoRV, which we now term subtype ""KoRV-A,"" whereas Los Angeles Zoo koalas with lymphomas/leukemias are infected in addition to KoRV-A by a unique KoRV we term subtype ""KoRV-B."" KoRV-B is most divergent in the envelope protein and uses a host receptor distinct from KoRV-A. KoRV-B also has duplicated enhancer regions in the LTR associated with increased pathology in gammaretroviruses. Whereas KoRV-A uses the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 1 (PiT1) as a receptor, KoRV-B employs a different receptor, the thiamine transporter 1 (THTR1), to infect cells. KoRV-B is transmitted from dam to offspring through de novo infection, rather than via genetic inheritance like KoRV-A.

However, it remains uncertain whether older but fit patients with AML really need to have their treatment attenuated. METHODS: To evaluate the contribution of age to outcome for patients with AML receiving intensive chemotherapy, data were analyzed for 2276 patients aged less than 65 years who were treated uniformly, regardless of age, in 3 consecutive prospective studies conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group. RESULTS: A substantial drop in overall survival (OS) between patients aged 40 to 49 years and 50 to 64 years led to a focus on 2 comparisons: 1) age < 50 versus >/= 50 years; and 2) age 50 to 54 versus 55 to 59 versus 60 to 64 years. OS was significantly better for patients aged < 50 years than that for those aged >/= 50 years (49.6% and 37.0% at 5 years; P < .001); older patients were more susceptible to relapse, but not to early death or nonrelapse mortality. The significant differences in OS between these 2 age groups were equally seen for patients with favorable, intermediate, and adverse cytogenetics (P < .001 each). Outcomes for those aged 50 to 54, 55 to 59, and 60 to 64 years were similar, with 5-year OS rates of 38.2%, 35.1%, and 38.0%, respectively (P = .934), and no differences in early death or nonrelapse mortality were observed among these age groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings justify the use of intensive chemotherapy without dose attenuation toward older but fit patients with AML, at least up to the age of 64 years.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Maeda, Tomoya', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Oh, Iekuni', 'Miyatake, Junichi', 'Kanbayashi, Hiroyuki', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Takahashi, Masatomo', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Ohtake S', 'Miyawaki S', 'Sakamaki H', 'Sakura T', 'Maeda T', 'Miyamura K', 'Asou N', 'Oh I', 'Miyatake J', 'Kanbayashi H', 'Takeuchi J', 'Takahashi M', 'Dobashi N', 'Kiyoi H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Emi N', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'age', 'early death', 'nonrelapse mortality', 'overall survival', 'relapse']",2013/06/27 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28212 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Sep 15;119(18):3326-33. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28212.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cultured and primary AML cells were treated with DAC and/or MS and analyzed by flow cytometry and immunoblot analyses. In the phase I study, 16 patients were enrolled; 8 were newly diagnosed patients 60 years or older and 8 were 18 years or older with relapsed AML. Only 2 of 16 patients (13%) had FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations, and no patient had KIT mutations. RESULTS: Compared with treatment with either agent alone, sequential treatment with DAC and MS exerted superior anti-AML activity in cultured and primary FLT3-ITD-expressing AML cells. In the subsequent phase I study, the MTD and schedule of administration of the combination was identified as DAC followed by MS. Three patients developed dose-limiting toxicities: two patients developed pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation and one patient developed a prolonged QTc greater than 500 msec. Based on an intent-to-treat analysis, 57% of the patients achieved stable disease or better while enrolled in the trial; 25% had a complete hematologic response. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed results similar to those previously reported for MS. CONCLUSION: The in vitro combination of DAC and MS is synergistically active against FLT3-ITD mutations expressing AML cells. In a clinical setting, the combination of sequentially administered DAC followed by MS is possible without significant unexpected toxicity, but the concurrent administration of DAC and MS led to pulmonary toxicity after only a few doses.

To be carcinogenic, benzene must be metabolized to produce toxic metabolites. To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the metabolic enzyme genes are associated with benzene-induced alterations in DNA methylation and hematotoxicity, we genotyped four commonly studied SNPs in three metabolic enzymes genes CYP1A1, EPHX1 and NQO1; and analyzed promoter DNA methylation status in 11 genes which have been reported to be associated with benzene-induced hematotoxicity (BLM, CYP1A1, EPHX1, ERCC3, NQO1, NUDT1, p15, p16, RAD51, TP53 and WRAP53) in 77 benzene-exposed workers and 25 unexposed controls in China. ERCC3, a DNA repair gene, showed a small but statistically significant increase of promoter DNA methylation in the exposed group compared with the unexposed group (mean +/- SD: 4.73 +/- 3.46% vs. 3.63 +/- 1.96%, P = 0.048). We also observed that an increased number of C allele for rs1051740 in EPHX1 was associated with decreased ERCC3 methylation levels in benzene-exposed workers (P(trend) = 0.001), but not in unexposed controls (P(trend) = 0.379). Interestingly, another EPHX1 SNP (rs2234922) was associated with lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (P(trend) = 0.044) in benzene-exposed workers. These associations remained the same when ERCC3 promoter methylation and WBCs were dichotomized according to the 90th percentile (>/=6%) of methylation levels in controls and a leucopenia cutoff (<4 x 10(9) /L), respectively. Our findings suggest that benzene exposure may be associated with hypermethylation in ERCC3, and that genetic variants in EPHX1 may play an important role in epigenetic changes and hematotoxicity among benzene-exposed workers.","['Xing, Caihong', 'Chen, Qi', 'Li, Guilan', 'Zhang, Linyuan', 'Zheng, Min', 'Zou, Zhengyong', 'Hou, Lifang', 'Wang, Qian-Fei', 'Liu, Xin', 'Guo, Xinbiao']","['Xing C', 'Chen Q', 'Li G', 'Zhang L', 'Zheng M', 'Zou Z', 'Hou L', 'Wang QF', 'Liu X', 'Guo X']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130625,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '146045-44-5 (XPBC-ERCC-3 protein)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.2.9 (EPHX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'China', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ERCC3', 'genetic polymorphism', 'methylation', 'microsomal epoxide hydrolase', 'occupational exposure']",2013/06/26 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.21786 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2013 Jul;54(6):397-405. doi: 10.1002/em.21786.

Here, we report the results of a functional analysis of CD82 in CD34(+) /CD38(-) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated downregulation of CD82 resulted in a decrease in the level of IL-10. In contrast, forced expression of CD82 in CD34(+)/CD38(+) AML cells by transduction with CD82-expressing lentiviral particles resulted in an increase in the levels of IL-10. Notably, exposure of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells to IL-10 stimulated clonogenic growth of these cells. Moreover, downregulation of CD82 by a shRNA dephosphorylated STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells. On the other hand, forced expression of CD82 resulted in increase in the levels of p-STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(+) AML cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results indicated that STAT5A binds to the promoter region of the IL-10 gene, while reporter gene assay results indicated stimulation of IL-10 expression at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that CD82 positively regulates the STAT5/IL-10 signaling pathway. Moreover, shRNA-mediated downregulation of CD82 expression in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells dephosphorylated STAT5 in immunodeficient mice. Taken together, our data suggest that the CD82/STAT5/IL-10 signaling pathway is involved in the survival of CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells and may thus be a promising therapeutic target for eradication of AML LSCs.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Nobumoto, Atsuya', 'Kataoka, Sayo', 'Tsuda, Masayuki', 'Udaka, Keiko', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Nobumoto A', 'Kataoka S', 'Tsuda M', 'Udaka K', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan; Research Fellow of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-8472, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130727,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Kangai-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD82', 'IL-10', 'STAT5', 'leukemia stem cells']",2013/06/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28348 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Jan 1;134(1):55-64. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28348.

The malignant cells express IL2 receptor alpha (CD25), and the majority express transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), in addition to T-cell markers. Occasional cases express CD30. Whereas Japanese cases are predominantly of the acute and chronic leukemic types, the less well-studied Caribbean cases are more often lymphomatous. We performed immunohistochemical analysis for CD25, Foxp3, and CD30 on samples from 42 US/Caribbean ATLL patients and correlated these markers with morphologic subtype and clinical characteristics. In the 16/42 patients who had successive biopsies, we determined the expression stability of these markers. Foxp3 was expressed in 26 of the 42 (62%) initial biopsies, and its intensity correlated with CD25 expression. It was more frequent in pleomorphic small-sized and medium-sized cell types than in large cell tumors but did not correlate with patients' clinical attributes. Foxp3 expression and morphology were unchanged in successive biopsies in 13 of 16 patients. Four initial biopsies had features of anaplastic large cell T lymphomas, all of which were Foxp3. Successive biopsies from 2 patients with pleomorphic medium cell variant showed diminishing expression of originally weak Foxp3 expression and de novo CD30 expression, whereas they showed morphologic progression to the anaplastic cell variant. A third patient's second biopsy revealed progression from pleomorphic medium to anaplastic large cell morphology with loss of Foxp3, but it remained CD30. Foxp3 expression correlates with pleomorphic small and medium cell types and may be lost with large cell transformation. The evolution of the latter type can be associated with the gain of CD30 expression; such ATLL tumors might respond to anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody therapies.","['Yao, Jinjuan', 'Gottesman, Susan R S', 'Ayalew, Getinet', 'Braverman, Albert S', 'Axiotis, Constantine A']","['Yao J', 'Gottesman SR', 'Ayalew G', 'Braverman AS', 'Axiotis CA']","['Departments of *Pathology double daggerHematology/Oncology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center Departments of daggerPathology section signHematology/Oncology, Kings County Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Caribbean Region/ethnology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/ethnology/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31828f2322 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2013 Sep;37(9):1407-12. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31828f2322.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the effect of tumour type and tumour size on EPR-mediated tumour localisation and cathepsin B-mediated drug release was studied. METHODS: Evans Blue (10 mg/kg) and an N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-doxorubicin (Dox) conjugate (FCE28068) (5 mg/kg Dox-equiv) were used as probes and tumour levels (and Dox release) measured at 1 h after i.v. administration in a panel of murine and human xenograft tumours. RESULTS: Evans Blue and FCE28068 displayed similar tumour levels in the range of 2-18 % dose/g at 1 h for B16F10 and L1210. Approximately half of the tumour models evaluated exhibited tumour size-dependent accumulation of FCE28068; smaller tumours had the highest accumulation. Administration of free Dox (5 mg/kg) produced tumour levels of \2.5 % dose/g independent of tumour size. Whereas the degree of EPR-mediated targeting showed *12-fold difference across the tumour models evaluated, Dox release from FCE28068 at 1 h displayed *200-fold variation. CONCLUSIONS: Marked heterogeneity was seen in terms of EPR effect and Dox release rate, underlining the need to carefully calibrate tumour models used to benchmark nanomedicines against known relevant standard agents and for optimal development of strategies for late pre-clinical and clinical development.","['Duncan, Ruth', 'Sat-Klopsch, Yee-Nee', 'Burger, Angelika M', 'Bibby, Michael C', 'Fiebig, Heinz H', 'Sausville, Edward A']","['Duncan R', 'Sat-Klopsch YN', 'Burger AM', 'Bibby MC', 'Fiebig HH', 'Sausville EA']","['Centre for Polymer Therapeutics, The School of Pharmacy, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London, UK. profruthduncan@btinternet.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Polymers)', '171714-74-2 (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide co-polymer-doxorubicin conjugate)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '45PG892GO1 (Evans Blue)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cathepsin B/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coloring Agents', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Evans Blue', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Nanotechnology', 'Permeability', 'Polyglutamic Acid', 'Polymers', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3718995,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-013-2209-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Aug;72(2):417-27. doi: 10.1007/s00280-013-2209-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to physiologically support hematopoiesis, but their contribution to the pathogenesis of MDS remains elusive. We show that MSC from patients across all MDS subtypes (n=106) exhibit significantly reduced growth and proliferative capacities accompanied by premature replicative senescence. Osteogenic differentiation was significantly reduced in MDS-derived MSC, indicated by cytochemical stainings and reduced expressions of Osterix and Osteocalcin. This was associated with specific methylation patterns that clearly separated MDS-MSC from healthy controls and showed a strong enrichment for biological processes associated with cellular phenotypes and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, in MDS-MSC, we detected altered expression of key molecules involved in the interaction with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), in particular Osteopontin, Jagged1, Kit-ligand and Angiopoietin as well as several chemokines. Functionally, this translated into a significantly diminished ability of MDS-derived MSC to support CD34+ HSPC in long-term culture-initiating cell assays associated with a reduced cell cycle activity. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis shows that MSC from all MDS subtypes are structurally, epigenetically and functionally altered, which leads to impaired stromal support and seems to contribute to deficient hematopoiesis in MDS.","['Geyh, S', 'Oz, S', 'Cadeddu, R-P', 'Frobel, J', 'Bruckner, B', 'Kundgen, A', 'Fenk, R', 'Bruns, I', 'Zilkens, C', 'Hermsen, D', 'Gattermann, N', 'Kobbe, G', 'Germing, U', 'Lyko, F', 'Haas, R', 'Schroeder, T']","['Geyh S', 'Oz S', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Frobel J', 'Bruckner B', 'Kundgen A', 'Fenk R', 'Bruns I', 'Zilkens C', 'Hermsen D', 'Gattermann N', 'Kobbe G', 'Germing U', 'Lyko F', 'Haas R', 'Schroeder T']","['Department of Hematology, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130329,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/genetics', 'Phenotype']",,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013193 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.193 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1841-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.193.

Worries about inadequacy of adult regimens urged many hematologists, including us, to reconsider their routine treatment practices. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to evaluate results of hyper-CVAD treatment in comparison to other intensive protocols. All patients aged </=65 years who were commenced on intensive induction chemotherapy between 1999 and 2011 were included in the study. Sixty-eight of 166 patients received hyper-CVAD, 65 were treated with CALGB-8811 regimen and 33 with multiple other protocols. Limited number of patients who were treated with other intensive protocols and mature B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases who were mostly given hyper-CVAD were eliminated from the statistical analyses. In spite of a favorable complete remission rate (84.2%), overall (26.3 vs. 44.2% at 5 years, p = 0.05) and disease-free (24.9 vs. 48.2%, p = 0.001) survival rates were inferior with hyper-CVAD compared to CALGB-8811 due to higher cumulative nonrelapse mortality risk (29.7 vs. 5.9%, p = 0.003) and no superiority in cumulative relapse incidence comparison (45% for both arms, p = 0.44).

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is potentially curative but has additional mortality risk. We evaluated RIC transplantation versus nontransplantation therapies in older patients with MDS stratified by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov decision model with quality-of-life utility estimates for different MDS and transplantation states was assessed. Outcomes were life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). A total of 514 patients with de novo MDS aged 60 to 70 years were evaluated. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, isolated 5q- syndrome, unclassifiable, and therapy-related MDS were excluded. Transplantation using T-cell depletion or HLA-mismatched or umbilical cord donors was also excluded. RIC transplantation (n = 132) stratified by IPSS risk was compared with best supportive care for patients with nonanemic low/intermediate-1 IPSS (n = 123), hematopoietic growth factors for patients with anemic low/intermediate-1 IPSS (n = 94), and hypomethylating agents for patients with intermediate-2/high IPSS (n = 165). RESULTS: For patients with low/intermediate-1 IPSS MDS, RIC transplantation LE was 38 months versus 77 months with nontransplantation approaches. QALE and sensitivity analysis did not favor RIC transplantation across plausible utility estimates. For intermediate-2/high IPSS MDS, RIC transplantation LE was 36 months versus 28 months for nontransplantation therapies. QALE and sensitivity analysis favored RIC transplantation across plausible utility estimates. CONCLUSION: For patients with de novo MDS aged 60 to 70 years, favored treatments vary with IPSS risk. For low/intermediate-1 IPSS, nontransplantation approaches are preferred. For intermediate-2/high IPSS, RIC transplantation offers overall and quality-adjusted survival benefit.","['Koreth, John', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Perez, Waleska S', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Park, Sophie', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Beach, C L', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Cutler, Corey']","['Koreth J', 'Pidala J', 'Perez WS', 'Deeg HJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M', 'Park S', 'Itzykson R', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P', 'Jadersten M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Gale RP', 'Beach CL', 'Lee SJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Greenberg PL', 'Tallman MS', 'DiPersio JF', 'Bunjes D', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Cutler C']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, D1B05, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, USA. jkoreth@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130624,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*surgery', 'Quality of Life', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",PMC3825320,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.46.8652 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.46.8652 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 20;31(21):2662-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.46.8652.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We applied the recently published Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) to 380 patients with MDS, registered in an Italian regional database, recruiting patients from the city of Rome (Gruppo Romano Mielodisplasie). Patients were selected based on the availability of IPSS-R prognostic factors, including complete peripheral-blood and bone marrow counts, informative cytogenetics, and follow-up data. RESULTS: We validated the IPSS-R score as a significant predictor of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in MDS (P < .001 for both). When comparing the prognostic value of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS), and IPSS-R, using the Cox regression model and the likelihood ratio test, a significantly higher predictive power for LFS and OS became evident for the IPSS-R, compared with the IPSS and WPSS (P < .001 for both). The multivariate analysis, including IPSS, WPSS, age, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin concentration, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, transfusion dependency, and type of therapy, confirmed the significant prognostic value of IPSS-R subgroups for LFS and OS. Treatment with lenalidomide and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was shown to be an independent predictor of survival in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that the IPSS-R is an excellent prognostic tool in MDS in the era of disease-modifying treatments. The early recognition of patients at high risk of progression to aggressive disease may optimize treatment timing in MDS.","['Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Fenu, Susanna', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Aloe-Spiriti, Maria Antonietta', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Andriani, Alessandro', 'Mancini, Stefano', 'Niscola, Pasquale', 'Naso, Virginia', 'Nobile, Carolina', 'Piccioni, Anna Lina', ""D'Andrea, Mariella"", ""D'Addosio, Ada"", 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Voso MT', 'Fenu S', 'Latagliata R', 'Buccisano F', 'Piciocchi A', 'Aloe-Spiriti MA', 'Breccia M', 'Criscuolo M', 'Andriani A', 'Mancini S', 'Niscola P', 'Naso V', 'Nobile C', 'Piccioni AL', ""D'Andrea M"", ""D'Addosio A"", 'Leone G', 'Venditti A']","[""Department of Hematology, Universita' Cattolica S.

In view of their medical importance and aiming to explore the amazing Brazilian biodiversity, we conducted bioprospecting of antiproliferative activity in extracts of Rhinella marina and Rhaebo guttatus toads occurring in the Southern Amazon of Mato Grosso, Brazil. LC-MS and HPLC analysis of the venom extracts of R. marina revealed four bufadienolides (telocinobufagin, marinobufagin, bufalin and resibufogenin. R. guttatus venom extracts contained only marinobufagin. First, R. marina and R. guttatus venom extracts were evaluated for cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines by the MTT assay. All extracts revealed cytotoxicity, where R. marina extracts were comparable to doxorubicin (IC(5)(0) values ranging from 0.01 to 0.23 mug/mL). Only extracts of R. guttatus toad venom caused membrane disruption of human erythrocytes. The extracts were investigated for selective activity by determining their effect on stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the Alamar Blue assay. The extracts were up to 80-fold more selective against leukemia cells when compared to dividing leukocytes. Aiming to confirm these antiproliferative effects, BrdU incorporation into DNA was measured in HL-60 treated cells with R. marina venom extracts. These extracts decreased BrdU incorporation at both concentrations tested. In summary, nine extracts of R. marina and R. guttatus venom showed pronounced lethal and discriminating effects on tumor lines, especially those from R. marina, highlighting toad parotoid gland secretions as a promising source for novel lead anticancer chemicals.","['Ferreira, Paulo Michel Pinheiro', 'Lima, Daisy Jereissati Barbosa', 'Debiasi, Bryan Wender', 'Soares, Bruno Marques', 'Machado, Katia da Conceicao', 'Noronha, Janaina da Costa', 'Rodrigues, Domingos de Jesus', 'Sinhorin, Adilson Paulo', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'Vieira, Gerardo Magela Jr']","['Ferreira PM', 'Lima DJ', 'Debiasi BW', 'Soares BM', 'Machado Kda C', 'Noronha Jda C', 'Rodrigues Dde J', 'Sinhorin AP', 'Pessoa C', 'Vieira GM Jr']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Campus Senador Helvidio Nunes de Barros, Federal University of Piaui, 64607-670 Picos, Piaui, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130622,England,Toxicon,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1307333,"['0 (Amphibian Venoms)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)']",IM,"['Amphibian Venoms/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Brazil', '*Bufonidae', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytostatic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antiproliferative activity', 'Bufadienolides', 'Rhaebo guttatus', 'Rhinella marina']",2013/06/26 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-0101(13)00223-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.06.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicon. 2013 Sep;72:43-51. doi: 10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.06.009.

Since polyphenols exert pro-apoptotic effects in solid tumors, our study investigated the effects of polyphenols in haematological malignancies. The effect of eight polyphenols (quercetin, chrysin, apigenin, emodin, aloe-emodin, rhein, cis-stilbene and trans-stilbene) were studied on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in four lymphoid and four myeloid leukemic cells lines, together with normal haematopoietic control cells. METHODS: Cellular proliferation was measured by CellTiter-Glo((R)) luminescent assay; and cell cycle arrest was assessed using flow cytometry of propidium iodide stained cells. Apoptosis was investigated by caspase-3 activity assay using flow cytometry and apoptotic morphology was confirmed by Hoescht 33342 staining. RESULTS: Emodin, quercetin, and cis-stilbene were the most effective polyphenols at decreasing cell viability (IC50 values of 5-22 muM, 8-33 muM, and 25-85 muM respectively) and inducing apoptosis (AP50 values (the concentration which 50% of cells undergo apoptosis) of 2-27 muM, 19-50 muM, and 8-50 muM respectively). Generally, lymphoid cell lines were more sensitive to polyphenol treatment compared to myeloid cell lines, however the most resistant myeloid (KG-1a and K562) cell lines were still found to respond to emodin and quercetin treatment at low micromolar levels. Non-tumor cells were less sensitive to all polyphenols compared to the leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that polyphenols have anti-tumor activity against leukemia cells with differential effects. Importantly, the differential sensitivity of emodin, quercetin, and cis-stilbene between leukemia and normal cells suggests that polyphenols are potential therapeutic agents for leukemia.","['Mahbub, Amani A', 'Le Maitre, Christine L', 'Haywood-Small, Sarah L', 'McDougall, Gordon J', 'Cross, Neil A', 'Jordan-Mahy, Nicola']","['Mahbub AA', 'Le Maitre CL', 'Haywood-Small SL', 'McDougall GJ', 'Cross NA', 'Jordan-Mahy N']","['Sheffield Hallam University, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, Sheffield, UK.

The present investigation was carried out to observe whether cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) plays important roles in Gla -induced cytotoxicity. Among major ent-kauranoid diterpenoids isolated, Gla A and B dose-dependently decreased the growth of HL-60 cells with an IC50 of approximately 6.15 and 5.86 microM at 24 h, respectively. Both Gla A and B could induce apoptosis, G2/M-phase cycle arrest, DNA damage and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HL-60 cells. Moreover, Gla A, B caused rapid decrease of the intracellular GSH content, while inhibition of cellular GSH synthesis by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) augmented the induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, the administration of GSH or GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) could rescue Gla A, B-depleted cellular GSH, and abrogate the induced cytotoxicity, G2/M-phase cycle arrest, DNA damage and ROS accumulation in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, Gla A, B decreased the activity of the GSH-related enzymes including glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX).

T-ALL is a poor prognostic hematopoietic malignancy. In order to establish a successful therapeutic treatment plan, it is essential to understand the biology of T-cell development and molecules that contribute to this process. This study uses Jurkat T cells, as a well-established model for in vitro study of T-ALL to investigate the role of the microRNA (miRNA), miR-146a, on gene expressions involved in T-cell differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The permanent over-expression of miR-146a was established using a lentivector that expressed GFP hsa-mir-146a miRNA. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry for T-cell differentiation to monitor induction of the differentiation process by assessing changes in expression of some distinct transcription factors and cell surface markers. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of miR-146a resulted in significant up-regulation of PU.1, c-Fos, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and GATA3, and slight up-regulation of Foxp3 and Runx1. There was a significant, moderate down-regulation in the expressions of Notch1, LIM-domain only (Lmo2), son of sevenless 1 (SOS1), Ikaros, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that ectopic expression of miR-146a could not independently induce differentiation in lymphoblastic cells. However, the expression of multiple genes involved in T-cell differentiation and T-cell CD markers were found to be affected. These results have suggested a potential tumor suppressive, immunomodulatory and cell activator role for miR146-a.","['Saki, Najmaldin', 'Abroun, Saeid', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Mortazavi, Yousef', 'Kaviani, Saeid', 'Arefian, Ehsan']","['Saki N', 'Abroun S', 'Soleimani M', 'Mortazavi Y', 'Kaviani S', 'Arefian E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat', 'T cell', 'differentiation', 'miR-146a']",2013/06/26 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['hem204 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000105 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Apr;19(3):141-7. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000105.

METHODS: Screened 350 CML patients and 350 controls for the two FLT3/mutations through polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. RESULTS: ITDs were detected in 12 of the 350 CML patients (3.4%) and D835 mutations in only four cases (1.14%), relatively low in frequency as compared to those reported earlier from non-Indian populations. None of the cases showed simultaneous occurence of both ITD and D835 mutations. DISCUSSION: These FLT3 mutations seem to be very rare in CML, and it is possible that these could be found only in a subset of patients who are in the progressive stage and/or with varied drug response. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of FLT3 mutations in CML pathogenesis, which may help devising therapeutic interventions.","['Annamaneni, Sandhya', 'Kagita, Sailaja', 'Gorre, Manjula', 'Digumarti, Raghunadha Rao', 'Satti, Vishnupriya', 'Battini, Mohan Reddy']","['Annamaneni S', 'Kagita S', 'Gorre M', 'Digumarti RR', 'Satti V', 'Battini MR']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspartic Acid/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Tyrosine/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3 gene', 'Mutations', 'Myeloid proliferation']",2013/06/26 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['hem191 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000109 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Apr;19(3):129-35. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000109.

This study aimed to analyze whether chronic ANE and ANE 30-100 K stimulations lead to higher stress resistance and autophagic activity in oral cells, and whether the resulting autophagic status in stimulated cells correlates with stress resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Malignant cells from the mouth oral epidermoid carcinoma Meng-1 (OECM-1) and blood (Jurkat T) origins were stimulated with non-cytotoxic ANE and ANE 30-100 K for 3 months. Sensitivity to anticancer drugs of and autophagy status in stimulated cells, analyzed respectively by XTT assay and calculating microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II LC3-II/beta-actin ratios from Western blot, were compared to non-treated cells. Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ), were used to assess whether autophagy inhibition interferes the altered chemoresistance. RESULTS: Areca nut extract-stimulated (ANE-s) and ANE 30-100 K-stimulated (30-100 K-s) OECM-1 and Jurkat T cells generally exhibited higher cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistances, compared to non-stimulated cells. Most stimulated cells expressed significantly higher levels of LC3-II and Atg4B proteins. Interestingly, these cells also showed stronger tolerances against hypoxia environment and expressed higher LC3-II levels under glucose-deprived and hypoxia conditions. Finally, both 3-MA and CQ alleviated, albeit to different degrees, the increased chemoresistance in ANE-s and/or 30-100 K-s cells. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stimulations of ANE or ANE 30-100 K may increase tolerance of oral cancer and leukemia T cells to anticancer drugs, as well as to glucose deprivation and hypoxia conditions, and cause an elevation of autophagy activity responsible for increased drug resistance.","['Yen, Ching-Yu', 'Chiang, Wei-Fan', 'Liu, Shyun-Yeu', 'Cheng, Pse-Chou', 'Lee, Sheng-Yang', 'Hong, Wen-Zhai', 'Lin, Pin-Yen', 'Lin, Mei-Huei', 'Liu, Young-Chau']","['Yen CY', 'Chiang WF', 'Liu SY', 'Cheng PC', 'Lee SY', 'Hong WZ', 'Lin PY', 'Lin MH', 'Liu YC']","['Department of Dentistry, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Dentistry, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Section, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130624,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '117038-70-7', '(2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-((phenylamino)carbonyl)-2H-tetrazoliu', 'm hydroxide)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ATG4B protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis/drug effects', 'Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Areca', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/analysis/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Mouth Neoplasms/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-fluorouracil', 'areca nut', 'autophagy', 'chemoresistance', 'cisplatin']",2013/06/26 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jop.12102 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2014 Feb;43(2):91-6. doi: 10.1111/jop.12102.

""Old"" has come to mean rather arbitrarily, patients over 60 years. This age cut off has been perpetuated by clinical trials whose eligibility is frequently at this cut point. Age is a continuous variable right through all age groups with AML and has independent prognostic significance. Chemo-resistance of the disease itself is part of the explanation, with a high frequency of adverse biology occurring at older age. Patient characteristics which compromise the delivery of treatment of adequate intensity are the other important influence. Medical co-morbidities are more frequent, and when combined with what is sometimes referred to as limited haematopoietic reserve, undoubtedly make successful delivery of intensive therapy less likely.

These controversies are even more manifest when it comes to elderly patients in whom concern for intensive chemotherapy (IC) related toxicity is the critical determinant for the therapeutic choice. In fact, due to concerns of treatment-related morbidity and mortality associated with delivery of IC, approximately only 30% of all patients >/=65 years are considered eligible for this approach. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been dedicated to alternative agents such as hypomethylators (azacitidine and decitabine).

We hypothesized that host ABCC4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetic profile of dasatinib and subsequently affect its antitumor properties. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transport of dasatinib was studied in cells transfected with human ABCC4 or the ortholog mouse transporter, Abcc4. Pharmacokinetic studies were done in wild-type and Abcc4-null mice. The influence of Abcc4 deficiency on dasatinib efficacy was evaluated in a model of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia by injection of luciferase-positive, p185(BCR-ABL)-expressing Arf(-/-) pre-B cells. RESULTS: Dasatinib accumulation was significantly changed in cells overexpressing ABCC4 or Abcc4 compared with control cells (P < 0.001). Deficiency of Abcc4 in vivo was associated with a 1.75-fold decrease in systemic exposure to oral dasatinib, but had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous dasatinib. Abcc4 was found to be highly expressed in the stomach, and dasatinib efflux from isolated mouse stomachs ex vivo was impaired by Abcc4 deficiency (P < 0.01), without any detectable changes in gastric pH. Abcc4-null mice receiving dasatinib had an increase in leukemic burden, based on bioluminescence imaging, and decreased overall survival compared with wild-type mice (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Abcc4 in the stomach facilitates the oral absorption of dasatinib, and it possibly plays a similar role for other orally administered substrates, such as acetylsalicylic acid. This phenomenon also provides a mechanistic explanation for the malabsorption of certain drugs following gastric resection.","['Furmanski, Brian D', 'Hu, Shuiying', 'Fujita, Ken-Ichi', 'Li, Lie', 'Gibson, Alice A', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Schuetz, John D', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Furmanski BD', 'Hu S', 'Fujita KI', 'Li L', 'Gibson AA', 'Janke LJ', 'Williams RT', 'Schuetz JD', 'Sparreboom A', 'Baker SD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Dasatinib', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics']",PMC3752901,,,2013/06/25 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0980 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Aug 15;19(16):4359-4370. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0980.

In this study, we obtained pure R and S enantiomers of four selected compounds by HPLC separation and chiral synthesis. The absolute configurations of these enantiomers were determined by comparing their circular dichroism spectra to that of an appropriate reference compound. In addition, a crystal structure of one selected compound revealed the exocyclic double bond in these compounds to be in the Z configuration. The binding affinities of all four pairs of enantiomers to Bcl-xL , Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 proteins were measured in a fluorescence-polarization-based binding assay, yielding inhibition constants (Ki values) ranging from 0.24 to 2.20 muM.

In the present study, a nucleic acid aptamer specific for protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) surface marker, sgc-8c, was conjugated electrostatically to pre-formed 10-kDa PEI/plasmid DNA polyplexes, and the ability of the conjugate to transfer genetic material was evaluated in MOLT-4 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cells, which express PTK7 on their surface. METHODS: Polyplexes (plasmid DNA-vector conjugates), prepared using PEI-sgc-8c conjugate and pCMVLuc as a reporter gene, were characterized in terms of particle size, surface charge and the extent of DNA condensation. Polyplexes were also evaluated for cytotoxicity using the MTS colorimetric assay, as well as for transfection efficiency in MOLT-4 cells, and compared with the results obtained in U266 cells, which lack cell surface PTK7. RESULTS: Relative to pDNA/PEI, the size of pDNA/PEI/sgc-8c aptamer polyplexes increased with decreasing zeta potential. In MOLT-4 cells, pDNA/PEI/sgc-8c aptamer polyplexes exhibited an almost six- to eight-fold increase in transfection efficiency compared to that of pDNA/PEI polyplex, indicating that conjugation of sgc-8c aptamer to pre-formed 10-kDa PEI/plasmid DNA polyplexes achieved effective targeting without covalent attachment, whereas receptor-mediated conducted transfection was confirmed by performing a competitive transfection experiment and a cellular uptake study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide an example of the usefulness of a nucleic acid aptamer in the form of noncovalent, electrostatic conjugates as an approach for enhancing the transfection efficiency of a polycation vector such as PEI without significant induced cytotoxicity.","['Shahidi-Hamedani, Nasim', 'Shier, Wayne T', 'Moghadam Ariaee, Faezeh', 'Abnous, Khalil', 'Ramezani, Mohammad']","['Shahidi-Hamedani N', 'Shier WT', 'Moghadam Ariaee F', 'Abnous K', 'Ramezani M']","['Pharmaceutical Research Centre, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorimetry', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Guanylate Cyclase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethyleneimine/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*chemistry/genetics', 'Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase', '*Static Electricity', 'Transfection']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'aptamer', 'nanoparticle', 'polyethylenimine', 'targeted delivery']",2013/06/25 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.2718 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2013 Jun-Jul;15(6-7):261-9. doi: 10.1002/jgm.2718.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

We used an ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) approach to resolve qualitatively and quantitatively the complexity of mutated populations surviving TKIs and to investigate their clonal structure and evolution over time in relation to therapeutic intervention. To this purpose, we performed a longitudinal analysis of 106 samples from 33 patients who had received sequential treatment with multiple TKIs and had experienced sequential relapses accompanied by selection of 1 or more TKI-resistant mutations. We found that conventional Sanger sequencing had misclassified or underestimated BCR-ABL mutation status in 55% of the samples, where mutations with 1% to 15% abundance were detected. A complex clonal texture was uncovered by clonal analysis of samples harboring multiple mutations and up to 13 different mutated populations were identified. The landscape of these mutated populations was found to be highly dynamic. The high degree of complexity uncovered by UDS indicates that conventional Sanger sequencing might be an inadequate tool to assess BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status, which currently represents an important component of the therapeutic decision algorithms.

Another study revealed that development of E. coli-derived asparaginase allergy and a switch to Erwinaze(R) maintained event-free survival in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL. In a multicenter, compassionate-use trial, Erwinaze(R) was generally well tolerated, with the most commonly occurring adverse events including hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, fever, hyperglycemia, and increased transaminase levels.

METHODS: The PEGylated bioactive lipids-based micelle system was constructed via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions among DOX, bioactive lipids PazPC and C6-ceramide. The micellar formulation was characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, stability and release behavior, etc., and in vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor efficacy and the underlying mechanism were further evaluated. RESULTS: This novel micellar system showed small size (~15 nm), high drug encapsulation efficiency (>90%), good stability and endosomal acid-triggered release of DOX. Synergistic cytotoxic effects between DOX and bioactive lipid C6-ceramide in P-gp overexpressing drug resistant leukemia P388/ADR cells were observed. The mechanistic studies demonstrated that modulation of drug efflux system and induction of apoptotic effects by lipids were responsible for the synergistic effects between DOX and C6-ceramide in drug resistant leukemia P388/ADR cells. Using an in-vivo P388/ADR leukemia mouse model, the median survival time of the DOX-loaded PEGylated micelles with PazPC and C6-ceramide as major components was significantly greater than that of free DOX and control group. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel pH sensitive bioactive lipids-based micellar formulation which could potentially be useful in delivering chemotherapeutic drug DOX and provide a novel strategy to increase the therapeutic index for drug resistant leukemia treatment.","['Wang, Yongzhong', 'Ding, Yunfei', 'Liu, Ziming', 'Liu, Xingrong', 'Chen, Li', 'Yan, Weili']","['Wang Y', 'Ding Y', 'Liu Z', 'Liu X', 'Chen L', 'Yan W']","['Department of Pharmacal Sciences Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, 36849, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130621,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Micelles)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/*chemistry', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Micelles']",,,,2013/06/25 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11095-013-1121-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2013 Nov;30(11):2902-16. doi: 10.1007/s11095-013-1121-5.

However, such abnormalities in CML patients treated with nilotinib as the first-line therapy have not been reported. Thirteen CML CP patients with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) cells were initially diagnosed in our hospital from December 2010 to July 2011. Patients were followed up by clinical assessment, cytogenetic analysis, and BCR-ABL transcriptional level every 3 to 6 months.

The aim of this report is to identify the potential benefits of unrelated CBT in high-risk childhood ALL with CNS relapse who has been treated on CNS-directed treatment strategies. Eleven childhood ALL patients with CNS relapse who underwent unrelated CBT enrolled in our study between 2001 and 2011, and all of the patients had features associated with poor outcomes, such as high white blood cells at diagnosis, ph + chromosome, or a history of bone marrow relapse. All transplants were performed with myeloablative-conditioning therapy (BU/cyclophosphamide (CY2) or total body irradiation/CY) plus highly CNS-active agents (carmustine or high-dose cytarabine). All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment. A total of nine patients (81.8 %) developed pre-engraftment syndrome at a median of 7 days, and three patients developed acute graft-vs-host disease at a median of 21 days. The median follow-up after CBT was 28.5 months. The probability of overall survival at 9 years was 63.6 %, and no patient experienced a CNS relapse. Our experience suggests that unrelated CBT appears to be an effective treatment option for CNS relapse of childhood ALL patients associated with poor outcome features.","['Zheng, Changcheng', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Tong, Juan', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Wang, Xingbing', 'Ding, Kaiyang', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zheng C', 'Tang B', 'Tong J', 'Liu H', 'Geng L', 'Wang X', 'Ding K', 'Sun Z']","['Shandong University School of Medicine, Jinan, 2500012, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130622,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",,,,2013/06/25 06:00,2014/01/07 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1820-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Dec;92(12):1665-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1820-3.

MKK3/6-dependent activation of p38MAPK is required for the phosphorylation of eIF4E, thus initiating the translation of ER stress-related transcription factor ATF4. Upregulated ATF4 results in the transcriptional initiation of the apoptosis-related chop gene and autophagy-related map1lc3b gene, through which selenite links ER stress to apoptosis and autophagy during leukemia treatment.

SBDS, the gene affected in most cases of SDS, encodes a protein known to influence many cellular processes including ribosome biogenesis, mitotic spindle assembly, chemotaxis, and the regulation of reactive oxygen species production. The best characterized role for the SBDS protein is in the production of functional 60S ribosomal subunits. Given that a reduction in functional 60S subunits could impact on the translational output of cells depleted of SBDS we analyzed protein synthesis in yeast cells lacking SDO1, the ortholog of SBDS. Cells lacking SDO1 selectively increased the synthesis of POR1, the ortholog of mammalian VDAC1 a major anion channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Further studies revealed the cells lacking SDO1 were compromised in growth on non-fermentable carbon sources suggesting mitochondrial function was impaired. These observations prompted us to examine mitochondrial function in human cells where SBDS expression was reduced. Our studies indicate that reduced expression of SBDS decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption and increases the production of reactive oxygen species. These studies indicate that mitochondrial function is also perturbed in cells expressing reduced amounts of SBDS and indicate that disruption of mitochondrial function may also contribute to SDS pathophysiology.","['Henson, Adrianna L', 'Moore, Joseph B 4th', 'Alard, Pascale', 'Wattenberg, Max M', 'Liu, Johnson M', 'Ellis, Steven R']","['Henson AL', 'Moore JB 4th', 'Alard P', 'Wattenberg MM', 'Liu JM', 'Ellis SR']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130619,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Sdo1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Carbon/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Fermentation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lipomatosis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow failure', 'Mitochondria', 'Ribosome', 'Translation']",2013/06/25 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)01002-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jul 19;437(1):29-34. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.06.028.

HQ post-translationally down-regulated cell surface TNF-alpha expression increases the release of sTNF-alpha into K562 cell culture medium. Meanwhile, HQ increased ADAM17 mRNA stability, leading to ADAM17 up-regulation in HQ-treated cells. Knock-down of ADAM17 abrogated HQ-induced sTNF-alpha secretion. HQ-evoked miR-122 down-regulation was proven to promote ADAM17 mRNA stability and up-regulate ADAM17 expression. HQ-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activation were responsible for suppression of miR-122 promoter luciferase activity and miR-122 expression. Activation of p38 MAPK and JNK elicited phosphorylation of c-Jun, ATF-2 and c-Fos, and knock-down of c-Jun, ATF-2 and c-Fos restored miR-122 expression in HQ-treated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitating and DNA affinity purification assay revealed c-Jun, ATF-2 and c-Fos binding to the miR-122 gene promoter region. Moreover, HQ-induced sTNF-alpha production in Bcr/Abl-positive leukemia cell lines KU812 and MEG-01 was also connected with miR-122 down-regulation and ADAM17 up-regulation, while HQ was unable to affect miR-122 and ADAM-17 expression on Bcr/Abl-negative leukemia U937 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that HQ induces down-regulation of miR-122 expression, leading to ADAM17 up-regulation and ADAM17-mediated TNF-alpha shedding. Consequently, HQ treatment increases the production of sTNF-alpha in leukemia cells with expressed Bcr/Abl.","['Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen YJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130620,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (MIRN122 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ADAM17', 'AP-1', 'Hydroquinone', 'JNK', 'TNF-alpha', 'miR-122', 'p38 MAPK']",2013/06/25 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(13)00380-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2013.06.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2013 Sep 1;86(5):620-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.06.009.

In both cell types, CopA3 also significantly inhibited the apoptosis and viability losses caused by 6-hydroxy dopamine (a Parkinson disease-mimicking agent) and okadaic acid (an Alzheimer's disease-mimicking agent). Immunoblotting revealed that the p27Kip1 protein (a negative regulator of cell cycle progression) was markedly degraded in CopA3-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Conversely, an adenovirus expressing p27Kip1 significantly inhibited the antiapoptotic effects of CopA3 against 6-hydroxy dopamine- and okadaic acid-induced apoptosis, and decreased the neurotropic effects of CopA3.

Diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 25), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 4), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1). Median follow-up for survivors was 21 months. All patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, primarily busulfan/fludarabine. All patients received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts: 44 from 8/8 matched unrelated donors, 8 from matched related donors, and 2 from 7/8 matched unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor-based in all patients. The median age at transplantation was 71 years (range, 70 to 76); the median HCT comorbidity index score was 1 (range, 0 to 5). Two patients died before hematopoietic recovery (1 with graft failure and 1 with disease progression), and 1 patient relapsed before hematopoietic recovery; otherwise, all engrafted with median donor chimerism of 94% at 1 month. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 13% and of grades III to IV acute GVHD, 9.3%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 36%, progression-free survival was 39%, overall survival was 39%, and relapse was 56%.

We compared reduced-intensity conditioning HCT in 197 consecutive patients 50 years and older with AML in complete remission from SIB (n = 82), URD (n = 35), or UCB (n = 80) transplantation.

Inhibition of phosphate export was also obtained with a soluble ligand generated from the envelope-receptor-binding domain of X-MLV in all human cell lines tested, as well as in diverse stem cells and epithelial cells derived from renal proximal tubules, the main site of phosphate homeostasis regulation.

To study the effects of such lesions, we generated animals carrying regulatable Fbxw7 mutant alleles. Here, we show that these mutations specifically bolster cancer-initiating cell activity in collaboration with Notch1 oncogenes but spare normal hematopoietic stem cell function. We were also able to show that FBXW7 mutations specifically affect the ubiquitylation and half-life of c-Myc protein, a key T-ALL oncogene. Using animals carrying c-Myc fusion alleles, we connected Fbxw7 function to c-Myc abundance and correlated c-Myc expression to leukemia-initiating activity.

RESULTS: In the first cycle of clofarabine, complete remission was obtained in 11 children (42%) and partial remission was obtained in 7 children (27%). Eight children (31%) were considered unresponsive. In the second cycle, 11 (85%) of the 13 children obtained complete remission, 1 (8%) partial remission and 1 (8%) was unresponsive. One child received three cycles and obtained complete remission in each cycle. The common adverse events were myelosuppression, infection, liver dysfunction and gastrointestinal adverse reactions. There were no chemotherapy-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Clofarabine is effective in the treatment of children with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its adverse effects can be tolerated. Clofarabine could be a promising new treatment for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Suo, Pan', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Wu, Jun', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wang, Bin', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Cheng, Yi-Fei', 'Liu, Gui-Lan']","['Suo P', 'Zhang LP', 'Wu J', 'Lu AD', 'Wang B', 'Zuo YX', 'Cheng YF', 'Liu GL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2013.06.012 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;15(6):444-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantitatively detect the mRNA expression of E2A-PBX1 gene in 11 newly diagnosed ALL patients at diagnosis (11 cases), complete remission (11 cases) and periods of relapse (3 cases). Ten children with normal bone marrow cell morphology and without hematopathy or tumor diseases were used as the control group. RESULTS: The median expression levels of E2A-PBX1 fusion gene in the ALL group at diagnosis and the relapse group were significantly higher than in the control and complete remission groups (P<0.01). Compared with E2A-PBX1 negative patients on day 33 during induction of remission, the recurrence rate increased and disease free survival rate at 3 year decreased significantly in E2A-PBX1 positive patients decreased (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of E2A-PBX1 levels by real-time RT-PCR is useful for monitoing minimal residual disease, prediction of relapse and individual treatment. The expression level of E2A-PBX1 gene on day 33 during induction of remission can be used for prognosis evaluation.","['Zhang, Rong', 'Liao, Jing', 'Li, Ge', 'Sun, Huai-Qiang', 'Shi, Yu-Jun', 'Yang, Ji-Yun']","['Zhang R', 'Liao J', 'Li G', 'Sun HQ', 'Shi YJ', 'Yang JY']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, China. zzrr0007@sohu.com""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2013.06.011 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2013 Jun;15(6):440-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that Tax1 activated an NF-kappaB binding (gpkappaB) site of the gp34/OX40 ligand gene in a cell type-dependent manner. Our examination showed that the gpkappaBeta site and authentic NF-kappaB (IgkappaB) site were activated by Tax1 in hematopoietic cell lines. Non-hematopoietic cell lines including hepatoma and fibroblast cell lines were not permissive to Tax1-mediated activation of the gpkappaB site, while the IgkappaB site was activated in those cells in association with binding of RelB. However RelA binding was not observed in the gpkappaB and IgkappaB sites. Our results suggest that HTLV-1 Tax1 fails to activate the canonical pathway of NF-kappaB in non-hematopoietic cell lines.

In both cases, the plasmablastic transformation and low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder shared the same immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements and an identical chromosomal translocation. Notably, both plasmablastic transformation cases also carried MYC gene rearrangements on chromosome 8q24, which have been frequently identified in de novo plasmablastic lymphoma.

We compared our cases with 24 additional cases reported in the literature. Based on our results, patients who present with leukemic FL tend to have higher risk disease. Leukemic FL also seems to be associated with a worse prognosis; however, larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.

The bone marrow is a niche for at least two types of stem cells, and the prototype is the hematopoietic stem cell/progenitors (HSC/Ps), which have saved many thousands of patients for several decades now. In bone marrow, HSC/Ps interact functionally with marrow stromal cells that are often referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or derivatives thereof. Myosin and matrix elasticity greatly affect MSC function, and these mechanobiological factors are now being explored with HSC/Ps both in vitro and in vivo. Also emerging is a role for the nucleus as a mechanically sensitive organelle that is semi-permeable to transcription factors which are modified for nuclear entry by cytoplasmic mechanobiological pathways. Since therapies envisioned with induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells generally involve in vitro commitment to an adult stem cell or progenitor, a very deep understanding of stem cell mechanobiology is essential to progress with these multi-potent cells.","['Shin, Jae-Won', 'Swift, Joe', 'Ivanovska, Irena', 'Spinler, Kyle R', 'Buxboim, Amnon', 'Discher, Dennis E']","['Shin JW', 'Swift J', 'Ivanovska I', 'Spinler KR', 'Buxboim A', 'Discher DE']","['Molecular and Cell Biophysics Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20130619,England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,['EC 3.6.1.- (Myosin Type II)'],IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Myosin Type II/*metabolism']",PMC3964600,['NOTNLM'],"['3D', 'AFM', 'BM', 'BMT', 'Bleb', 'ECM', 'ESC', 'G-CSF', 'HSC/P', 'Hematopoiesis', 'MAL/MKL', 'MK', 'MLCK', 'MSC', 'Matrix', 'Mechanobiology', 'Myosin', 'NMM-II', 'Nucleus', 'OB', 'RBC', 'RLC', 'ROCK', 'SDF-1', 'SRF', 'YAP', 'atomic force microscopy', 'blebbistatin', 'bone marrow', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'extracellular matrix', 'granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', 'hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor', 'kPa', 'kilopascal, units of elasticity', 'megakaryocyte', 'megakaryocytic acute leukemia protein', 'mesenchymal stem cell', 'myosin light chain kinase', 'non-muscle myosin-II', 'osteoblast', 'red blood cell', 'regulatory light chains', 'rho-associated protein kinase', 'serum response factor', 'stromal derived factor-1', 'three-dimensional', 'yes-associated protein']",2013/06/25 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-4681(13)00026-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.diff.2013.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2013 Oct;86(3):77-86. doi: 10.1016/j.diff.2013.05.001.

Immunophenotyping was used to classify leukemic cells as Bor Tlymphoblasts and to identify the aberrant expression of myeloid-associated antigens.

No significant associations were found between the expression of MyAg and the presence of known adverse prognostic features (eg: age>30 years, male gender, high WBC count and Philadelphia positivity). Also, we failed to observe any statistically significant difference between MyAg-positive and MyAg-negative patients in terms of achievement of complete remission and overall survival at 3 years.

METHODS: The human pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 were treated with JLC at the concentration of 0.05-1.00 mg/mL for 24-120 h. The inhibition rate of JLC on human pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethiylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC/Propidium iodide (AV-FITC/PI) method. Cell cycles were determined by PI staining. The expression of 5100 Calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) in cell matrix was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of apoptosis-related protein such as BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Cys-teinylaspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase-3) were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: JLC significantly inhibited the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. JLC promoted cell apoptosis and maintained cell cycle in S and G2/M phase rather than G1/G0 phase. The expression of 5100A4 in the cell matrix was reduced. The expression of cell apoptotic protein BNIP3 was increased while Bcl-2 was decreased. CONCLUSION: JLC can inhibit the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells BxPC-3 by stimulating cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle at S and G2/M phase which blocks the circulation of normal cell cycle and reducing the expression of S100A4 protein. Higher pro-apoptosis protein BNIP3 and lower anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 levels were found, which may be related to the apoptotic effects of JLC.","['Li, Yaoyuan', 'Hu, Jieqing', 'Huang, Hui', 'He, Yonghe']","['Li Y', 'Hu J', 'Huang H', 'He Y']","[""Department of Oncology, Guang'an men Hospital Affiliated to China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100053, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,J Tradit Chin Med,Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan,8211546,"['0 (Capsules)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (jinlong)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Capsules/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/26 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2013/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/s0254-6272(13)60126-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Tradit Chin Med. 2013 Apr;33(2):205-10. doi: 10.1016/s0254-6272(13)60126-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mathematical modeling is an invaluable tool to help in predicting hematopoiesis behavior. In this paper we modify the existing models based on improving the parameters of the model. Also more parameters are estimated regarding the proposed model. It is our major intention to construct a physiological model which can map major identified mechanisms of leukopoiesis to provide a deeper insight into this complex biological process. In the proposed model the leukocytes line has been modeled more precisely. In fact, precursor cells have been considered as two separate groups: proliferating precursor cells and non-proliferating precursor cells. As a result, more parameters have appeared in the model and identifying the new parameters has resulted in a better fit of clinical data and the data extracted from the model for both platelets and leukocytes. That is, the new model describes the leukocytes and platelets of the system in a way that is closer to clinical data, so the proposed model can be more useful for predicting the behavior of leukocytes and platelets for PCML disease. Compared with the previous works, it is shown that the new model has a better fit of the quantitative data on leukocytes and platelets.","['Safarishahrbijari, Anahita', 'Gaffari, Ali']","['Safarishahrbijari A', 'Gaffari A']","['Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, K.N.

Recently, additional markers in CLL, including the expression level of apoptosis-regulating genes/proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1) and microRNAs, have been suggested. In this review, we attempt to provide data concerning the properties of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as to present its prognostic value in CLL. LPL mRNA expression level was able to predict mutational status in a high percentage of CLL cases and high LPL expression was associated with shorter treatment-free survival.

The objective of the study was to analyze the ex vivo drug resistance profile to bortezomib and 22 other antileukemic drugs, including three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), in CML in comparison to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 82 patients entered the study, including 36 CML and 46 AML adults. Among CML patients, 19 had advanced disease, 16 were resistant to imatinib, and 6 had ABL-kinase domain mutations. The ex vivo drug resistance profile was studied by the MTT assay. RESULTS: CML CELLS WERE MORE RESISTANT THAN AML BLASTS TO THE FOLLOWING DRUGS: prednisolone, vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, melphalan, cytarabine, fludarabine, thiotepa, 4-HOO-cyclophosphamide, thioguanine, bortezomib, topotecan, and clofarabine. CML cells were 2-fold more sensitive to busulfan than AML cells. CML patients with clinical imatinib resistance had higher ex vivo resistance to vincristine, daunorubicin, etoposide, and busulfan. No significant differences to all tested drugs, including TKIs, were observed between CML patients with non-advanced and advanced disease. CML patients with mutation had higher ex vivo resistance to vincristine, idarubicin, thiotepa, and busulfan. CONCLUSIONS: CML cells are ex vivo more resistant to most drugs than acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Busulfan is more active in CML than AML cells. In comparison to AML cells, bortezomib has little ex vivo activity in CML cells. No differences between CML subgroups in sensitivity to 3 tested TKIs were detected.","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Kolodziej, Beata', 'Kurylo-Rafinska, Beata', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Gniot, Michal', 'Lewandowska, Maria', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Styczynski J', 'Gil L', 'Czyzewski K', 'Kolodziej B', 'Kurylo-Rafinska B', 'Lewandowski K', 'Gniot M', 'Lewandowska M', 'Komarnicki M', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum , Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland ; Both authors contributed equally to the study.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120706,Poland,Contemp Oncol (Pozn),"Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)",101233223,,,,PMC3687416,['NOTNLM'],"['MTT assay', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'drug sensitivity']",2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/wo.2012.29286 [doi]', '18843 [pii]']",ppublish,Contemp Oncol (Pozn). 2012;16(3):210-4. doi: 10.5114/wo.2012.29286.

The recommended dose of dasatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was changed from 70 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily following a Phase III dose-optimization study. To better understand the superior benefit-risk profile of dasatinib 100 mg once daily, exposure-response was characterized for efficacy (major cytogenetic response) and safety (pleural effusion). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dasatinib exposure in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was determined by population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from seven dasatinib clinical studies (N = 981), including the Phase III dose-optimization study (n = 567). Data from the Phase III study were then used to characterize exposure-response relationships for the four dasatinib treatment regimens investigated (100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, 140 mg once daily, and 70 mg twice daily). RESULTS: Major cytogenetic response was significantly (P < 0.01) associated with weighted average steady-state dasatinib plasma concentrations, and pleural effusion was significantly associated with trough concentration. Major cytogenetic response was also significantly associated with maintenance of uninterrupted dosing. The 100 mg once daily arm had the lowest steady-state trough concentration of the four dose arms investigated in the Phase III study, and although this arm also had the lowest weighted average steady-state dasatinib plasma concentration, it had the highest dose maintenance. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib dose optimization to 100 mg once daily from 70 mg twice daily significantly minimizes adverse events while maintaining efficacy by exploiting differences in the measures of exposure associated with efficacy and safety.","['Wang, Xiaoning', 'Roy, Amit', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Chen, Tai-Tsang', 'Shah, Neil P']","['Wang X', 'Roy A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Chen TT', 'Shah NP']","['Discovery Medicine and Clinical Pharmacology, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130610,New Zealand,Clin Pharmacol,Clinical pharmacology : advances and applications,101564865,,,,PMC3684141,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'major cytogenetic response', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pleural effusion']",2013/06/22 06:00,2013/06/22 06:01,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CPAA.S42796 [doi]', 'cpaa-5-085 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Jun 10;5:85-97. doi: 10.2147/CPAA.S42796.

We analyzed treatment outcomes and potential risk factors in children and adolescents with advanced-stage LL treated over a 40-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1962 through 2002, 146 patients (99 boys and 47 girls) with stage III (n = 111) or stage IV (n = 35) LL were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. The five treatment eras were 1962-1975 (no protocol), 1975-1979 (NHL-75), 1979-1984 (Total 10 High), 1985-1992 (Pediatric Oncology Group protocol), and 1992-2002 (NHL13). Age at diagnosis was <10 years in 65 patients and >/=10 years in 81. RESULTS: Outcomes improved markedly over successive treatment eras. NHL13 produced the highest 5-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate (82.9% +/- 6.1% [SE]) compared with only 20.0% +/- 8.0% during the earliest era. Treatment era (P < 0.0001) and age at diagnosis (<10 years versus >/=10 years, P = 0.0153) were independent prognostic factors, whereas disease stage, lactate dehydrogenase level, and presence of a pleural effusion were not. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment era and age were the most important prognostic factors for children with advanced-stage LL.

HES1 transcriptionally silences phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), resulting in AKT activation, which is reversed by Notch1 inhibition with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Mutational loss of PTEN is frequent in T-ALL and promotes resistance to GSIs due to AKT activation. GSI treatments increased AKT-Thr(308) phosphorylation and signaling in PTEN-deficient, GSI-resistant T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT3), suggesting that Notch1 represses AKT independent of its PTEN transcriptional effects. AKT-Thr(308) phosphorylation and downstream signaling were also increased by knocking down Notch1 in Jurkat (N1KD) cells. This was blocked by treatment with the AKT inhibitor perifosine. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and the protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) inhibitor okadaic acid both impacted AKT-Thr(308) phosphorylation to a greater extent in nontargeted control than N1KD cells, suggesting decreased dephosphorylation of AKT-Thr(308) by PP2A in the latter. Phosphorylations of AMP-activated protein kinasealpha (AMPKalpha)-Thr(172) and p70S6K-Thr(389), both PP2A substrates, were also increased in both N1KD and GSI-treated cells and responded to okadaic acid treatment. A transcriptional regulatory mechanism was implied because ectopic expression of dominant-negative mastermind-like protein 1 increased and wild-type HES1 decreased phosphorylation of these PP2A targets. This was independent of changes in PP2A subunit levels or in vitro PP2A activity, but was accompanied by decreased association of PP2A with AKT in N1KD cells. These results suggest that Notch1 can regulate PP2A dephosphorylation of critical cellular regulators including AKT, AMPKalpha, and p70S6K.","['Hales, Eric C', 'Orr, Steven M', 'Larson Gedman, Amanda', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Matherly, Larry H']","['Hales EC', 'Orr SM', 'Larson Gedman A', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH']","['Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130620,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*physiology', 'Threonine/*metabolism']",PMC3829367,['NOTNLM'],"['AMP-activated Kinase (AMPK)', 'Akt PKB', 'GSI-resistant', 'Leukemia', 'Myc', 'Notch Pathway', 'PP2A', 'PTEN-null', 'T-ALL', 'mTOR']",2013/06/22 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)45443-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.451625 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Aug 2;288(31):22836-48. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.451625.

Here we demonstrate, for the first time, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent regulation of the OCT4-NANOG circuitry necessary to maintain the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM), the source of in vitro-derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We show that STAT3 is highly expressed in mouse oocytes and becomes phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus in the four-cell and later stage embryos. Using leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif)-null embryos, we found that STAT3 phosphorylation is dependent on LIF in four-cell stage embryos. In blastocysts, interleukin 6 (IL-6) acts in an autocrine fashion to ensure STAT3 phosphorylation, mediated by janus kinase 1 (JAK1), a LIF- and IL-6-dependent kinase. Using genetically engineered mouse strains to eliminate Stat3 in oocytes and embryos, we firmly establish that STAT3 is essential for maintenance of ICM lineages but not for ICM and trophectoderm formation. Indeed, STAT3 directly binds to the Oct4 and Nanog distal enhancers, modulating their expression to maintain pluripotency of mouse embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. These results provide a novel genetic model of cell fate determination operating through STAT3 in the preimplantation embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vivo.","['Do, Dang Vinh', 'Ueda, Jun', 'Messerschmidt, Daniel M', 'Lorthongpanich, Chanchao', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Feng, Bo', 'Guo, Guoji', 'Lin, Peiyu J', 'Hossain, Md Zakir', 'Zhang, Wenjun', 'Moh, Akira', 'Wu, Qiang', 'Robson, Paul', 'Ng, Huck Hui', 'Poellinger, Lorenz', 'Knowles, Barbara B', 'Solter, Davor', 'Fu, Xin-Yuan']","['Do DV', 'Ueda J', 'Messerschmidt DM', 'Lorthongpanich C', 'Zhou Y', 'Feng B', 'Guo G', 'Lin PJ', 'Hossain MZ', 'Zhang W', 'Moh A', 'Wu Q', 'Robson P', 'Ng HH', 'Poellinger L', 'Knowles BB', 'Solter D', 'Fu XY']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Blastocyst Inner Cell Mass/cytology/metabolism', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', '*Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/physiology', 'Protein Binding', '*STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3701193,['NOTNLM'],"['NANOG', 'OCT4', 'STAT3', 'embryogenesis', 'embryonic stem cell', 'inner cell mass']",2013/06/22 06:00,2013/08/22 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['27/12/1378 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.221176.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2013 Jun 15;27(12):1378-90. doi: 10.1101/gad.221176.113.,['R01 CA125568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MCL-1 is also highly expressed in myocardium, but its function in myocytes has not been investigated. We generated inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout mice and found that ablation of Mcl-1 in the adult heart led to rapid cardiomyopathy and death. Although MCL-1 is known to inhibit apoptosis, this process was not activated in MCL-1-deficient hearts. Ultrastructural analysis revealed disorganized sarcomeres and swollen mitochondria in myocytes. Mitochondria isolated from MCL-1-deficient hearts exhibited reduced respiration and limited Ca(2+)-mediated swelling, consistent with opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Double-knockout mice lacking MCL-1 and cyclophilin D, an essential regulator of the mPTP, exhibited delayed progression to heart failure and extended survival. Autophagy is normally induced by myocardial stress, but induction of autophagy was impaired in MCL-1-deficient hearts. These data demonstrate that MCL-1 is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis and induction of autophagy in the heart.

Here, we report that cardiac-specific ablation of Mcl-1 results in a rapidly fatal, dilated cardiomyopathy manifested by a loss of cardiac contractility, abnormal mitochondria ultrastructure, and defective mitochondrial respiration. Strikingly, genetic ablation of both proapoptotic effectors (Bax and Bak) could largely rescue the lethality and impaired cardiac function induced by Mcl-1 deletion. However, while the overt consequences of Mcl-1 loss were obviated by combining with the loss of Bax and Bak, mitochondria from the Mcl-1-, Bax-, and Bak-deficient hearts still revealed mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities and displayed deficient mitochondrial respiration. Together, these data indicate that merely blocking cell death is insufficient to completely overcome the need for MCL-1 function in cardiomyocytes and suggest that in cardiac muscle, MCL-1 also facilitates normal mitochondrial function. These findings are important, as specific MCL-1-inhibiting therapeutics are being proposed to treat cancer cells and may result in unexpected cardiac toxicity.","['Wang, Xi', 'Bathina, Madhavi', 'Lynch, John', 'Koss, Brian', 'Calabrese, Christopher', 'Frase, Sharon', 'Schuetz, John D', 'Rehg, Jerold E', 'Opferman, Joseph T']","['Wang X', 'Bathina M', 'Lynch J', 'Koss B', 'Calabrese C', 'Frase S', 'Schuetz JD', 'Rehg JE', 'Opferman JT']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Respiration/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Heart Failure/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/genetics', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myocardium/cytology/pathology', 'Oxygen Consumption/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",PMC3701191,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'MCL-1', 'apoptosis', 'heart failure', 'mitochondria']",2013/06/22 06:00,2013/08/22 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['27/12/1351 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.215855.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2013 Jun 15;27(12):1351-64. doi: 10.1101/gad.215855.113.,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-102175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Associations between exposure duration and rates of leukemia and myeloid leukemia were further examined using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Compared to the US population, myeloid leukemia mortality was elevated but overall leukemia mortality was not. In internal analyses, overall leukemia mortality increased with increasing exposure duration and this trend was statistically significant.

However, small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 family members such as ABT-737 restore a functional apoptosis pathway in cancer cells, and its oral analog ABT-263 (Navitoclax) has entered clinical trials. Gene engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells also show promise in B-cell malignancy, and as they induce apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, we hypothesized that small-molecule inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family may potentiate the efficacy of CAR T cells by engaging both apoptosis pathways. CAR T cells targeting CD19 were generated from healthy donors as well as from pre-B-ALL (precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia) patients and tested together with ABT-737 to evaluate apoptosis induction in five B-cell tumor cell lines. The CAR T cells were effective even if the cell lines exhibited different apoptosis resistance profiles, as shown by analyzing the expression of apoptosis inhibitors by PCR and western blot. When combining T-cell and ABT-737 therapy simultaneously, or with ABT-737 as a presensitizer, tumor cell apoptosis was significantly increased. In conclusion, the apoptosis inducer ABT-737 enhanced the efficacy of CAR T cells and could be an interesting drug candidate to potentiate T-cell therapy.","['Karlsson, H', 'Lindqvist, A C', 'Fransson, M', 'Paul-Wetterberg, G', 'Nilsson, B', 'Essand, M', 'Nilsson, K', 'Frisk, P', 'Jernberg-Wiklund, H', 'Loskog, A']","['Karlsson H', 'Lindqvist AC', 'Fransson M', 'Paul-Wetterberg G', 'Nilsson B', 'Essand M', 'Nilsson K', 'Frisk P', 'Jernberg-Wiklund H', 'Loskog A']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. hannah.karlsson@igp.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (ICAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/22 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201335 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2013.35 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2013 Jul;20(7):386-93. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2013.35.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of BCR-ABL small interfering RNA (siRNA) and GFI1B siRNA silencing on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in myeloid blast crises. The GFI1B gene was mapped to chromosome 9 and is, therefore, located downstream of the BCR-ABL translocation in CML cells. Co-transfection of BCR-ABL siRNA and GFI1B siRNA dramatically decreased cell viability and significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in K562 cells (P<0.0001) and primary advanced phase CML cells (P<0.0001) versus controls. Furthermore, combining of BCR-ABL siRNA and GFI1B siRNA significantly modified the expression of several relevant genes including Myc, MDR1, MRP1 and tyrosyl-phosphoproteins in primary CML cells. Our data suggest that silencing of both BCR-ABL siRNA and GFI1B siRNA is associated with an additive antileukemic effect against K562 cells and primary advanced CML cells, further validating these genes as attractive therapeutic targets.","['Koldehoff, M', 'Zakrzewski, J L', 'Beelen, D W', 'Elmaagacli, A H']","['Koldehoff M', 'Zakrzewski JL', 'Beelen DW', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. michael.koldehoff@uk-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130621,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/22 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201331 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2013.31 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2013 Jul;20(7):421-7. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2013.31.

OBSERVATIONS: There is no survival difference between enhanced triple intrathecal therapy (ETIT) and cranial radiation for CNSL patients with positive morphology and MRD. Positive MRD correlated with CNSL, whereas negative MRD indicated a lower chance of CNSL recurrence. Altogether 79 cerebral spinal fluid specimens indicating negative morphology but positive MRD were given either ETIT or conventional triple intrathecal therapy. The ETIT group indicated lower relapse.

It is found that the functionalized GO can selectively adsorb the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled single-stranded DNA probe and quench its fluorescence. The probe can be displaced by the PML/RARalpha fusion gene to restore the fluorescence, which can be detected by laser confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

This study analyzes the prognostic impact of MK in a cohort of primary, untreated patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A total of 431 patients were extracted from an international database. To analyze whether MK is an independent prognostic marker in MDS, cytogenetic and clinical data were explored in uni- and multivariate models regarding overall survival (OS) as well as AML-free survival. In all, 204/431 (47.3%) patients with MK were identified. Regarding OS, MK was prognostically significant in patients with </= 4 abnormalities only. In highly complex karyotypes (>/= 5 abnormalities), MK did not separate prognostic subgroups (median OS 4.9 months in MK+ vs 5.6 months in patients without MK, P=0.832). Based on the number of abnormalities, MK-positive karyotypes (MK+) split into different prognostic subgroups (MK+ and 2 abnormalities: OS 13.4 months, MK+ and 3 abnormalities: 8.0 months, MK+ and 4 abnormalities: 7.9 months and MK+ and >/= 5 abnormalities: 4.9 months; P<0.01). In multivariate analyses, MK was not an independent prognostic factor.

In this study, we determined the effect of oxidative stress on cell proliferation and characterization of cell death in human KG1 cells treated with H2O2. Our results indicated that oxidative stress leads to a significant decrease in cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our study suggests that antiproliferative and apoptotic cell death effects of H2O2 took place via activation of caspase-3, affecting the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax (an antiapoptotic and a proapoptotic factor, respectively), and through deactivation of catalase enzyme, leading to accumulation of intracellular ROS and depletion of intracellular ATP level.","['Oraki Kohshour, Mojtaba', 'Najafi, Leila', 'Heidari, Maryam', 'Ghaffari Sharaf, Mehdi']","['Oraki Kohshour M', 'Najafi L', 'Heidari M', 'Ghaffari Sharaf M']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. mojtabao@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120911,Korea (South),J Acupunct Meridian Stud,Journal of acupuncture and meridian studies,101490763,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/22 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2005-2901(12)00130-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jams.2012.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Acupunct Meridian Stud. 2013 Jun;6(3):134-41. doi: 10.1016/j.jams.2012.08.004.

This article weighs the benefits against potential harms, highlighting strategies for appropriate patient selection and administration. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified upon literature review, which were combined with our clinical and institutional experience. RESULTS: Fludarabine-based regimens result in an overall response rate of approximately 95% and of untreated CLL patients. Fludarabine also causes potentially irreversible grade 3 or 4 cytopenias and infection in the majority of patients. Furthermore, future hematopoietic cell mobilization may be difficult and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia occur in at least 3% of patients. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine should be used judiciously in older patients, and avoided entirely in patients with renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood cell counts with appropriate dose reduction/omission is vital. Finally, alternatives such as pentostatin and bendamustine should be considered.","['Lukenbill, Joshua', 'Kalaycio, Matt']","['Lukenbill J', 'Kalaycio M']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130617,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effects', 'Fludarabine', 'Myelosuppression', 'Secondary malignancy', 'Toxicities']",2013/06/22 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(13)00153-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2013.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Sep;37(9):986-94. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2013.05.004.

In this analysis we evaluated omacetaxine in CML patients with resistance or intolerance to 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were pooled from 2 phase II trials of subcutaneous omacetaxine, administered at 1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days until response, then for 7 days every 28 days as maintenance. Patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib and at least 1 other approved TKI (dasatinib and/or nilotinib) were included; results for patients in chronic phase (CP) are reported here. Major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients with CML-CP (median age, 59 years; range, 26-83 years) were included in the analysis. All patients previously received imatinib, 69 (85%) previously received dasatinib, and 48 (59%) previously received nilotinib. Median omacetaxine exposure was 7.5 months (range, 0.03-38.6 months), with 13 patients ongoing. MCyR was reported in 16 patients (20%; one-sided 95% lower confidence limit, 12.8%), including 8 complete responses; median duration was 17.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.1 months - not reached). Fifty-six patients (69%) achieved and/or maintained hematologic response for at least 8 weeks; median duration was 12.2 months (range, 8.4-26.2 months). Median failure-free and overall survival were 9.6 months and 34 months, respectively. Toxicity was mainly hematologic: the most common grade 3/4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (67%), neutropenia (47%), and anemia (37%). CONCLUSION: Omacetaxine produced clinically meaningful responses with acceptable tolerability in patients with CML-CP previously treated with 2 or more TKIs.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Akard, Luke', 'Craig, Adam', 'Nanda, Nisha', 'Benichou, Annie-Claude', 'Leonoudakis, Janis', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Cortes JE', 'Nicolini FE', 'Wetzler M', 'Lipton JH', 'Akard L', 'Craig A', 'Nanda N', 'Benichou AC', 'Leonoudakis J', 'Khoury HJ', 'Hochhaus A', 'Baccarani M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Little is known about the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of children and their family. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CDH treated according to the most recent concepts and methods outlined above on child survivors' QoL and their parents' QoL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study incorporated a cross-sectional design performed in two PICU (Marseille, France). Families of CDH survivors born between 1999 and 2008 were eligible. The following data were recorded: socio-demographics, antenatal history and delivery, initial hospitalization history. Self-reported data were collected by mail, including current clinical problems of the children (13-symptom list), children's QoL (Kidscreen-27 questionnaire), and parents' QoL (Short-Form 36 questionnaire). Children's QoL score was compared with controls and QoL of survivors of childhood leukemia. Parent's QoL was compared with controls. Non-parametric statistics were employed. RESULTS: Forty-two families agreed to participate and questionnaires were completed by 32 of them. Twenty-one children had a current clinical problems related to CDH. All the QoL scores of CHD survivors were significantly lower compared with controls. The physical well-being dimension was significantly higher for CHD survivors compared with survivors of childhood leukemia. Gastro-esophageal reflux at discharge, antenatal diagnosis, length of stay in the PICU, and neuropsychological and respiratory issues significantly impacted QoL scores of children. The parents of CHD survivors had significantly poorer score in emotional role dimension compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The impact of CDH on QoL seems to be important and must be understood by clinicians who treat these children and their parents.","['Michel, Fabrice', 'Baumstarck, Karine', 'Gosselin, Agathe', 'Le Coz, Pierre', 'Merrot, Thierry', 'Hassid, Sophie', 'Chaumoitre, Kathia', 'Berbis, Julie', 'Martin, Claude', 'Auquier, Pascal']","['Michel F', 'Baumstarck K', 'Gosselin A', 'Le Coz P', 'Merrot T', 'Hassid S', 'Chaumoitre K', 'Berbis J', 'Martin C', 'Auquier P']","['Espace Ethique Mediterraneen, ADES UMR 7268 ADES, Espace Ethique Mediterraneen Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille 13385, France. fabrice.michel@ap-hm.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130620,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France', '*Health Status', 'Hernia, Diaphragmatic/physiopathology/psychology', '*Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",PMC3718687,,,2013/06/22 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1750-1172-8-89 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-1172-8-89 [doi]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2013 Jun 20;8:89. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-8-89.,,,,,,,,,"['PACA Group Research for Quality of Life of children with a congenital', 'diaphragmatic hernia']",,,,

This population-based study estimated the 5-year relative survival and 'cure' for 48 380 adult patients diagnosed with AML in England during 1971-2006. Relative survival and cure mixture models were used to produce estimates of 5-year relative survival and the percentage 'cured'. 'Cure' was defined as the proportion of a group of survivors for whom there is no excess mortality compared with the general population. The 5-year relative survival and the percentage 'cured' increased for patients aged under 70 years at diagnosis during 1971-2006, but advancing age was associated with poorer outcome. During the study period a dramatic increase in 5-year relative survival occurred in those aged 15-24 years, from 7% to 53%. The percentage 'cured' was less than 10% for all ages in 1975, but increased to 45% for those aged 15-24 years in 2000.

We develop five asymptotic interval estimators for the RD in closed form. These include the interval estimator using the weighted least-squares (WLS) estimator, the WLS interval estimator with tanh (-1)(x) transformation, the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) type interval estimator, the MH interval estimator with tanh (-1)(x) transformation, and the interval estimator using the idea of Fieller's theorem and a randomization-based variance. We employ Monte Carlo simulation to study and compare the finite-sample performance of these interval estimators in a variety of situations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The viability of cells was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide tetrazolium (MTT) test. Apoptosis was analyzed using a fl ow cytometer as well as fl uorescence microscopy with 4'-6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of caspase-3, poly ADP- ribose polymerase (PARP) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). RESULTS: Several distinct sonochemical effects were found after SDT treatment. The participation of MAPK signals in SDT which caused U937 cell damage was specifically examined and the inhibition of p38 MAPK and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) both apparently exerted a negative effect on SDT-induced cell death, while extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK1/2) inhibition enhanced SDT-induced cell death. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly enhanced by SDT, and pre-treatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) partially alleviated SDT-induced cell viability loss, DNA fragmentation, mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) dissipation, caspase-3 activation, but interestingly MAPK activation was not affected much by NAC. CONCLUSIONS: In the present paper, cell apoptosis of U937 cells was markedly enhanced after Ce6-SDT. Meanwhile, p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK were all differently activated in this process. One possible explanation for the induced cell apoptosis could be the increased ROS generation in Ce6-SDT.","['Su, Xiaomin', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Guo, Ling', 'Li, Silu', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Su X', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Guo L', 'Li S', 'Liu Q']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , P.

DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional survey. ANIMALS: 311 healthy lactating Holstein dairy cattle from herds in Michigan (n = 2), Wisconsin (1), Iowa (1), and Pennsylvania (1). PROCEDURES: Whole and anticoagulated (EDTA) blood samples were collected. Serum samples were tested for antibody against BLV by use of an ELISA. Absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte concentrations were measured in EDTA blood samples with an automated hematology analyzer and manual differential cell counts. RESULTS: 208 cows tested positive and 103 cows tested negative for anti-BLV antibodies. Neutrophil concentration was not significantly different between BLV-positive versus BLV-negative cattle. The distribution of lymphocyte concentration was positively skewed for the entire cow population (n = 311) and the BLV-positive subset (208). In contrast, lymphocyte concentration distribution was approximately normal for BLV-negative cows (n = 103). Consequently, the presence or absence of BLV infection strongly influenced the calculated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte concentration ratio. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that absolute lymphocyte concentration is significantly affected by BLV infection in dairy cattle. Accordingly, hematologic reference intervals should be derived from healthy animals that are not infected with BLV and patient BLV status must be considered for meaningful interpretation of lymphocyte concentration. We recommend that the calculated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio be abandoned because it does not provide more information than direct comparison of patient absolute leukocyte concentration with updated reference intervals from healthy BLV-negative cattle.","['Swenson, Cheryl L', 'Erskine, Ronald J', 'Bartlett, Paul C']","['Swenson CL', 'Erskine RJ', 'Bartlett PC']","['Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation and Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. swenson@cvm.msu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood/epidemiology/pathology', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,2013/06/22 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/06/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/javma.243.1.131 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2013 Jul 1;243(1):131-5. doi: 10.2460/javma.243.1.131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, arguably, until recently, the importance of this phenomenon had not been largely recognized. The emergence and subsequent debunking of Xenotropic Murine leukemia virus-Related Virus (XMRV) as a cell culture contaminant as opposed to a potential pathogen in several human diseases, notably prostate cancer and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, highlighted a potential problem of murine endogenous gammaretroviruses infecting commonly used human cell lines. Subsequent to the discovery of XMRV, many additional cell lines that underwent xenotransplantation in mice have been shown to harbor murine gammaretroviruses. Such retroviral infection poses the threat of not only confounding experiments performed in these cell lines via virus-induced changes in cellular behavior but also the potential infection of other cell lines cultured in the same laboratory. Thus, the possibility of xenotropic retroviral infection of cell lines may warrant additional precautions, such as periodic testing for retroviral sequences in cell lines cultured in the laboratory.","['Hempel, Heidi A', 'Burns, Kathleen H', 'De Marzo, Angelo M', 'Sfanos, Karen S']","['Hempel HA', 'Burns KH', 'De Marzo AM', 'Sfanos KS']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130617,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC3683812,['NOTNLM'],"['XMRV', 'cancer', 'cell line', 'gammaretrovirus', 'xenotransplantation']",2013/06/21 06:00,2013/06/21 06:01,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00156 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Jun 17;3:156. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00156. eCollection 2013.,['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It may closely resemble other skin lymphomas, particularly mycosis fungoides (MF). CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman presented some ellipsoid scaling patches lasting 18 months and developed a large tumoral lesion in the abdomen, which were previously diagnosed as MF. Although histopathologic and immunohistochemistry findings were in consonance with this diagnosis, the fast progression of the disease raised the suspicion that it could represent another type of T-cell lymphoma. The work-up revealed a positive anti-HTLV-1 serology and molecular studies confirmed the monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus into neoplastic cells of the skin, but not into circulating lymphocytes. Extensive investigations were unable to demonstrate any systemic involvement. The final diagnosis was of primary cutaneous type of ATLL. The patient was submitted to a chemotherapy regimen with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, later to conjugated dexamethasone and surgical cytoreduction and then to a second line treatment with gemcitabine, resulting in partial response. A bone marrow heterologous transplantation was performed, but failed to achieve a sustained remission. DISCUSSION: ATLL is a rare lymphoid malignancy in non-endemic HTLV-1 areas, the diagnosis of which could be missed if not highly suspected. In addition to the four subtypes of Shimoyama classification (acute, lymphomatous, chronic and smoldering), a fifth one denominated primary cutaneous and characterized by presence of lesions only in the skin had been proposed and is herein exemplified.","['Lyra-da-Silva, Julia Ocampo', 'de Mello Gonzaga, Yung Bruno', 'de Melo Espindola, Otavio', 'de Andrada-Serpa, Maria Jose', 'Dib, Cassio', 'Jeunon, Thiago']","['Lyra-da-Silva JO', 'de Mello Gonzaga YB', 'de Melo Espindola O', 'de Andrada-Serpa MJ', 'Dib C', 'Jeunon T']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital Federal de Bonsucesso, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20120430,Austria,Dermatol Pract Concept,Dermatology practical & conceptual,101585990,,,,PMC3663345,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymphoma']",2012/04/01 00:00,2012/04/01 00:01,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5826/dpc.0202a03 [doi]', 'dp0202a03 [pii]']",epublish,Dermatol Pract Concept. 2012 Apr 30;2(2):202a03. doi: 10.5826/dpc.0202a03.

HTLV-2 is aleukemic and predominantly immortalizes/transforms CD8(+) T cells in culture. We have shown previously that the viral envelope is the genetic determinant of the differential T cell tropism in culture. The surface component (SU) of the HTLV-1 envelope is responsible for binding to the cellular receptors for entry. Here, we dissect the HTLV-1 SU further to identify key domains that are involved in determining the immortalization tropism. We generated HTLV-1 envelope recombinant virus containing the HTLV-2 SU domain. HTLV-1/SU2 was capable of infecting and immortalizing freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture. HTLV-1/SU2 shifted the CD4(+) T cell immortalization tropism of wild-type HTLV-1 (wtHTLV-1) to a CD8(+) T cell preference. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution, N195D, in HTLV-1 SU (Ach.195) resulted in a shift to a CD8(+) T cell immortalization tropism preference. Longitudinal phenotyping analyses of the in vitro transformation process revealed that CD4(+) T cells emerged as the predominant population by week 5 in wtHTLV-1 cultures, while CD8(+) T cells emerged as the predominant population by weeks 4 and 7 in wtHTLV-2 and Ach.195 cultures, respectively. Our results indicate that SU domain independently influences the preferential T cell immortalization tropism irrespective of the envelope counterpart transmembrane (TM) domain. We further showed that asparagine at position 195 in HTLV-1 SU is involved in determining this CD4(+) T cell immortalization tropism. The slower emergence of the CD8(+) T cell predominance in Ach.195-infected cultures suggests that other residues/domains contribute to this tropism preference.","['Kannian, Priya', 'Fernandez, Soledad', 'Jones, Kathryn S', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Kannian P', 'Fernandez S', 'Jones KS', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20130619,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', '*Viral Tropism', 'Virulence Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3754058,,,2013/06/21 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01079-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01079-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Aug;87(16):9344-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01079-13.

TRIM5 proteins are dimeric, and their association with the viral capsid appears to be enhanced by avidity effects owing to formation of higher-order oligomeric complexes. We examined the stoichiometric requirement for TRIM5 functional recognition by quantifying the efficiencies of restriction of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles containing various proportions of restriction-sensitive and -insensitive CA subunits. Both TRIMCyp and TRIM5alpha inhibited infection of retrovirus particles containing as little as 25% of the restriction-sensitive CA protein. Accordingly, we also observed efficient binding of TRIMCyp in vitro to capsid assemblies containing as little as one-fourth wild-type CA protein. Paradoxically, the ability of HIV-1 particles to abrogate TRIMCyp restriction in trans was more strongly dependent on the fraction of wild-type CA than was restriction of infection. Collectively, our results indicate that TRIM5 restriction factors bind to retroviral capsids in a highly cooperative manner and suggest that TRIM5 can engage a capsid lattice containing a minimum of three or fewer recognizable subunits per hexamer. Our study supports a model in which localized binding of TRIM5 to the viral capsid nucleates rapid polymerization of a TRIM5 lattice on the capsid surface.","['Shi, Jiong', 'Friedman, David B', 'Aiken, Christopher']","['Shi J', 'Friedman DB', 'Aiken C']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130619,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Capsid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC3754041,,,2013/06/21 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00713-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00713-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Aug;87(16):9271-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00713-13.

Experience with aeABLC as treatment of fungal lung disease is limited. DESIGN: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of aeABLC adjunct therapy for fungal lung disease in a retrospective study of 32 immunosuppressed adults. All values are given as +/- standard deviation. SETTING: National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. PATIENTS: Acute leukemia (69%) and severe neutropenia (63%) were common. Fifty-six percent of patients had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 185 +/- 424 days prior to aeABLC was commenced. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: High-dose corticosteroids were administered during aeABLC in 28% of patients. Fungal lung disease was proven or probable in 41% of patients. Most patients (78%) received concurrent systemic antifungal therapy for a median of 14 +/- 18 days before aeABLC. The median cumulative aeABLC dose was 1050 +/- 2368 mg, and the median duration of aeABLC therapy was 28 +/- 130 days. Most patients (78%) received 50 mg aeABLC twice daily. Partial or complete resolution of fungal lung disease was noted in 50% of patients. In three patients (9%) modest cough, mild bronchospasm, and transient chest pain with accompanying nausea and vomiting resolved completely after discontinuation of aeABLC. No patient required hospitalization for drug toxicity or had a serious (grade III or IV) drug-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: Treatment with aeABLC was tolerated without serious toxicity and may be considered in the setting of severe immunosuppression, cancer, and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with difficult-to-treat fungal lung disease.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Rodriguez, Gilhen H']","['Safdar A', 'Rodriguez GH']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130619,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",PMC3791151,['NOTNLM'],"['aerosolized amphotericin B lipid complex', 'cancer', 'hematopoietic transplantation', 'infections', 'lung disease', 'neutropenia', 'refractory fungal infection']",2013/06/21 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1309 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2013 Oct;33(10):1035-43. doi: 10.1002/phar.1309.

In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of an ethanol extract of D. morbifera stem bark (EEDM) on human leukemia U937 cells. EEDM markedly inhibited the growth of U937 cells by decreasing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. EEDM-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was associated with the upregulation of death receptor-related protein levels and downregulation of anti-apoptotic IAP family proteins. The increase in apoptosis was also associated with proteolytic activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, Bid cleavage, and loss of MMP suggesting that apoptosis of U937 cells induced by EEDM was through the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VED-fmk, significantly inhibited EEDM-induced U937 cell apoptosis indicating that the caspases were key regulators of apoptosis in response to EEDM in U937 cells.

We have shown previously that HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (HBZ), a viral regulatory protein encoded by the human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) cooperates with JunD to enhance hTERT transcription in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells. Menin, the product of the tumor-suppressor MEN-1 gene, also interacts with JunD, represses its transcriptional activity and downregulates telomerase expression. The main objective of this study was to examine how menin and HBZ get involved in the regulation of hTERT transcription. In this study, we report that JunD and menin form a repressor complex of hTERT transcription in HBZ-negative cells. Conversely, in HBZ-positive cells, the formation of a JunD/HBZ/menin ternary complex and the recruitment of p300 histone acetyl transferase activity by HBZ lead to a decreased activity of the JunD-menin suppressor unit that correlates with the activation of hTERT transcription. Silencing HBZ or menin expression in ATL cells confirms that these proteins are differentially involved in telomerase regulation. These results propose that HBZ, by impeding the tumor-suppressor activity of menin, functions as a leukemogenic cofactor to upregulate gene transcription and promote JunD-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Borowiak, Malgorzata', 'Kuhlmann, Anne-Sophie', 'Girard, Sophie', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Jalinot, Pierre', 'Dodon, Madeleine Duc']","['Borowiak M', 'Kuhlmann AS', 'Girard S', 'Gazzolo L', 'Mesnard JM', 'Jalinot P', 'Dodon MD']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130619,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (JunD protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2013/06/21 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['bgt221 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgt221 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Nov;34(11):2664-72. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt221.

The geriatric population is particularly vulnerable to these mediators as these cytokines and chemokines are also implicated in the development of frailty, fatigue, and declining cognitive function. It is the combination of these adverse effects of cytokines and chemokines that affect performance status and, in turn, the poor prognosis in this age group. Cytokines and chemokines are emerging as therapeutic targets in AML. Future endeavors to treat AML will likely involve cytokines and chemokines as attempts are made to disrupt the bone marrow environment.

Overall, 28% had KIT, 6% FLT3(ITD), 10% FLT3(TKD), 27% RAS and 6% CBL mutations. Mutant levels for all genes/loci were highly variable. KIT mutations were associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse but in multivariate analysis this was only significant for cases with a higher mutant level of 25% or greater (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.52, P=0.04). Similarly, only FLT3(ITD-HIGH) was a significant adverse factor for overall survival (OS; CI=1.27-5.39, P=0.004). Conversely, FLT3(TKD-HIGH) and CBL(HIGH) were both favorable factors for OS (CI= 0.31-0.89, P=0.01 and CI=0.05-0.85, P=0.02, respectively). KIT mutations were frequently lost at relapse, which is relevant to minimal residual disease detection and the clinical use of KIT inhibitors.

A systematic literature review assessed the effect of novel agents (thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide) on HRQoL in MM patients, and evaluated the subsequent reporting of these HRQoL results. A relatively small body of literature addresses HRQoL data in MM patients treated with novel MM therapeutic agents: 9 manuscripts and 15 conference proceedings. The literature demonstrates the complementary value of HRQoL when assessing clinical response, progression, overall survival and toxicity. However, weaknesses and inconsistencies in analysis and presentation of HRQoL data were observed, often complicating interpretation of the impact of treatment on HRQoL in MM. Further evaluation of HRQoL in MM patients treated with novel agents is required in larger cohorts, and ideally in head-to-head comparative studies. Additionally, the development of standardised MM-specific best practice guidelines in HRQoL data collection and analysis is recommended.

After a median follow-up of 42 months, complete hematologic response was achieved in 76% of patients with PV and 77% of those with ET.

Serial sequencing of TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, DNMT3A, and IDH1/2 revealed that patients failing to achieve CMR had a higher frequency of mutations outside the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway and were more likely to acquire new mutations during therapy. Patients with both JAK2V617F and TET2 mutations at therapy onset had a higher JAK2V617F mutant allele burden and a less significant reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden compared with JAK2 mutant/TET2 wild-type patients.

Often, the focus of therapy is centered on achieving complete remission of disease in order to proceed with a consolidative stem cell transplant. At issue with this paradigm is the multitude of patients who are unable to achieve complete remission with standard chemotherapeutic options. A major benefit of transplantation is the graft versus tumor effect that follows successful engraftment. However, with this graft versus tumor effect comes the risk of graft versus host disease. Therefore, alternative treatment options that utilize immunotherapy while minimizing toxicity are warranted. Herein, we propose a novel treatment protocol in which haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells are infused into patients with refractory hematological malignancies. The end goal of cellular therapy is not engraftment but instead is the purposeful rejection of donor cells so as to elicit a potent immune reaction that appears to break host tumor tolerance. METHODS/DESIGN: The trial is a FDA and institutional Rhode Island Hospital/The Miriam Hospital IRB approved Phase I/II study to determine the efficacy and safety of haploidentical peripheral blood cell infusions into patients with refractory hematological malignancies. The primary objective is the overall response rate while secondary objectives will assess the degree and duration of response as well as safety considerations. Patients with refractory acute leukemias and aggressive lymphomas over the age of 18 are eligible. Donors will be selected amongst family members. Full HLA typing of patients and donors will occur as will chimerism assessments. 1-2x108 CD3+ cells/kilogram will be infused on Day 0 without preconditioning. Patients will be monitored for their response to therapy, in particular for the development of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that has been previously described. Blood samples will be taken at the onset, during, and following the cessation of CRS so as to study effector cells, cytokine/chemokine release patterns, and extracellular vesicle populations. Initially, six patients will be enrolled on study to determine safety. Provided the treatment is deemed safe, a total of 25 patients will be enrolled to determine efficacy. DISCUSSION: Cellular Immunotherapy for Refractory Hematological Malignancies provides a novel treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia or aggressive lymphoma. We believe this therapy offers the immunological benefit of bone marrow transplantation without the deleterious effects of myeloablative conditioning regimens and minus the risk of GVHD. Laboratory correlative studies will be performed in conjunction with the clinical trial to determine the underlying mechanism of action. This provides a true bench to bedside approach that should serve to further enrich knowledge of host tumor tolerance and mechanisms by which this may be overcome.

We used dasatinib after bone marrow transplantation prior to the anticipated relapse for the purpose of prophylaxis against relapse. After discontinuation of dasatinib administration, molecular remission has lasted for 7 months.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. RESULTS: Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions.

A variety of transcription factors may be activated in consequence of oxidative stress, leading to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell cycle regulatory molecules and anti-inflammatory molecules. In this review, the data related to the action of oxidative stress on the onset of various oncohematologic diseases are summarized, thus bringing together some of the latest information available on the pathogenetic role of oxidative stress in cancer. The authors evaluate the most recent publications on this topic, and, in particular, show the newest evidence of a relationship between oxidative stress and hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and chronic Ph-negative myeloproliferative diseases. A separate section is devoted to the implications of a change of oxidative stress in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Finally, particular attention is given to the new markers of oxidative stress, such as carbonyl groups, advanced glycation end products, advanced oxidation protein products and S-nitrosylated proteins, which are certainly more stable, reliable, cheaper and more easily identifiable than those already used in clinical practice.

The majority of these patients are elderly with comorbidities, therefore limiting the use of intensive therapies which, even if used, unfortunately yield low responses. While azacitidine prolongs survival in patients with HR-MDS by a median of 9.5 months, responses only occur in less than half of the patients, and azacitidine therapy is not curative, with most patients relapsing within 2 years. Therefore, strategies to improve outcomes in these patients are needed. Azacitidine and lenalidomide both have meaningful single-agent clinical activity in HR-MDS and AML with del(5q). Early-phase trials in HR-MDS without del(5q) suggest increased activity with a concurrent azacitidine-lenalidomide combination.

Bendamustine, a bifunctional alkylating agent, has been tested alone or in combination in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In this article, the authors reported data, collected retrospectively, regarding repeatedly treating patients affected by indolent lymphoid malignancies with bendamustine-including regimens at the moment of relapse. Their experience showed that this drug is effective and manageable even when reused in both settings: chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas combined with rituximab and/or mitoxantrone. The slow evolution in the treatment of patients with lymphoid malignancies has recently given way to a major revolution. Over the past decade, the availability of novel and active targeted agents, particularly monoclonal antibodies, has engendered major progress in the treatment of both aggressive and indolent lymphoid malignancies. Despite the fact that new therapeutic strategies are relying less on nonspecific cytotoxic drugs and more on targeted agents, a pattern of relapse followed by further therapy is prevalent in patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies, indicating the need for additional effective salvage therapies.","['Montillo, Marco', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra']","['Montillo M', 'Tedeschi A']","[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy. marco.montillo@ospedaleniguarda.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male']",,,,2013/06/21 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.13.26 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2013 Jun;6(3):247-50. doi: 10.1586/ehm.13.26.,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Aug;54(8):1640-6.

In Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, fludarabine was first studied in patients with relapsed or refractory disease after alkylator therapy, yielding an overall response rate of 30%. In the late 1990 s, fludarabine started to be used as a first-line treatment monotherapy yielding response rates between 36 and 94%. A recent Phase III trial showed that fludarabine monotherapy was more effective than chlorambucil in terms of progression-free survival, duration of response and overall survival. Fludarabine has also been studied in combination with rituximab and/or alkylating agents, leading to better-quality and longer lasting responses.

We studied the effects of Setdb1 over-expression. We unexpectedly observed that exogenously expressed GFP-Setdb1 was retained in the cytoplasm, whereas endogenous Setdb1 showed a punctate nuclear signal. Leptomycin B (LMB) treatment, which blocks protein export from the nucleus, showed that entry of GFP-Setdb1 to the nucleus was regulated and that GFP-Setdb1 in the nucleus could localize at PML-NB as endogenous Setdb1. An analysis of Setdb1 deletion constructs showed that the N-terminal region was related to the nuclear export of Setdb1; supporting this, we detected two nuclear export signal motifs in this region. This N-terminal region had a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) whose mutation greatly reduced the ability of Setdb1 to associate with PML-NB and thus resulted in the disaggregation of PML-NB structure. We therefore presume that the cytoplasmic retention of over-expressed Setdb1 occurs as part of a regulatory mechanism to set a tight limit on the nuclear activity of Setdb1, whose excess activity might result in random and haphazard chromatin modifications that cause globally aberrant gene expression.","['Cho, Sunwha', 'Park, Jung Sun', 'Kang, Yong-Kook']","['Cho S', 'Park JS', 'Kang YK']","['Development and Differentiation Research Center, KRIBB, 111 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-806, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130620,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/21 06:00,2014/01/03 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/gtc.12068 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2013 Aug;18(8):694-703. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12068.

Thus, tumor cells are target of many therapeutic strategies and tumor research is focused on searching more efficient and specific drugs as well as new therapeutic approaches. One of the areas of tumor research is an issue of external fields. In our work, we tested influence of a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) and a hypothetic field of the pulsed vector magnetic potential (PVMP) on the growth of tumor cells; and further the possible growth inhibition effect of the PVMP. METHODS: Both unipolar and bipolar PEMF fields of 5 mT and PVMP fields of 0 mT at frequencies of 15 Hz, 125 Hz and 625 Hz were tested on cancer cell lines derived from various types of tumors: CEM/C2 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), SU-DHL-4 (B-cell lymphoma), COLO-320DM (colorectal adenocarcinoma), MDA-BM-468 (breast adenocarcinoma), and ZR-75-1 (ductal carcinoma). Cell morphology was observed, proliferation activity using WST assay was measured and simultaneous proportion of live, early apoptotic and dead cells was detected using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A PEMF of 125 Hz and 625 Hz for 24 h-48 h increased proliferation activity in the 2 types of cancer cell lines used, i.e. COLO-320DM and ZR-75-1. In contrast, any of employed methods did not confirm a significant inhibitory effect of hypothetic PVMP field on tumor cells.","['Loja, Tomas', 'Stehlikova, Olga', 'Palko, Lukas', 'Vrba, Kamil', 'Rampl, Ivan', 'Klabusay, Martin']","['Loja T', 'Stehlikova O', 'Palko L', 'Vrba K', 'Rampl I', 'Klabusay M']","['Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute , Brno , Czech Republic .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130619,England,Electromagn Biol Med,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,101133002,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Field Therapy/instrumentation/*methods', '*Magnetic Fields']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer cell lines', 'cell viability', 'pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF)', 'pulsed vector magnetic potential (PVMP) field']",2013/06/21 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2013/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15368378.2013.800104 [doi]'],ppublish,Electromagn Biol Med. 2014 Sep;33(3):190-7. doi: 10.3109/15368378.2013.800104.

METHODS: The present study comprised a retrospective study that aimed to estimate prevalence of being underweight and overweight and obesity at diagnosis for patients with childhood ALL on three successive UK treatment trials: UKALL X (1985-1990; n = 1033), UKALL XI (1990-1997; n = 2031), UKALL 97/99 (1997-2002; n = 898).The BMI for age was used to define weight status with both UK 1990 BMI for age reference data and the Cole-International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definitions. RESULTS: The prevalence of being underweight was 6% in the most recent trial for which data were available. The prevalence of being overweight and obesity was 35% in the most recent trial when expressed using Cole-IOTF definitions and 41% when expressed relative to UK 1990 reference data.

It was initially identified in rat skeletal muscle as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylated and inactivated glycogen synthase. This versatile protein is involved in numerous signaling pathways that influence metabolism, embryogenesis, differentiation, migration, cell cycle progression and survival. Recently, GSK-3 has been implicated in leukemia stem cell pathophysiology and may be an appropriate target for its eradication. In this review, we will discuss the roles that GSK-3 plays in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis as how this pivotal kinase can interact with multiple signaling pathways such as: Wnt/beta-catenin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Notch and others. Moreover, we will discuss how targeting GSK-3 and these other pathways can improve leukemia therapy and may overcome therapeutic resistance. In summary, GSK-3 is a crucial regulatory kinase interacting with multiple pathways to control various physiological processes, as well as leukemia stem cells, leukemia progression and therapeutic resistance.

Recent studies have shown that the Hsp90 inhibitor, SNX-2112, effectively inhibits tumor cell growth and angiogenesis in hematological and solid tumors. However, little is known about the effects of SNX-2112 on leukemias that are resistant to chemotherapy, which is emerging as a major clinical problem. In this study, the effects of SNX-2112 on the multidrug-resistant human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562/ADR cell line were investigated. We observed that SNX-2112 exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibitory activities against K562/ADR cells. These effects included the induction of apoptosis and secondary necrosis in addition to cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2 phases. Furthermore, SNX-2112-induced apoptosis was predominantly mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, initiated by the release of cytochrome c and the participation of Bcl-2 family proteins. SNX-2112 also induced the activation of the caspase-3, -8 and -9 cascade and the subsequent cleavage of PARP in K562/ADR cells. Moreover, the inactivation of the Akt and NF-kappaB signaling pathways may be involved in SNX-2112-induced apoptosis. The expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and several chaperons related to drug resistance and apoptosis were also shown to be inhibited, including the Grp78 and Hsp90 isoforms, Grp94 and Trap1. Taken together, these results provide a possible molecular mechanism for the anti-cancer effect of SNX-2112 on K562/ADR cells and provide new insights into the future application of SNX-2112 as a therapeutic agent for anti-multidrug-resistant leukemias.","['Wang, Rui', 'Shao, Fangyuan', 'Liu, Zhong', 'Zhang, Jiaxuan', 'Wang, Shaoxiang', 'Liu, Jinyun', 'Liu, Hui', 'Chen, Hongyuan', 'Liu, Kaisheng', 'Xia, Min', 'Wang, Yifei']","['Wang R', 'Shao F', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang J', 'Wang S', 'Liu J', 'Liu H', 'Chen H', 'Liu K', 'Xia M', 'Wang Y']","['Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bioengineering Medicine, National Engineering Research Center of Genetic Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130615,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SNX 2112)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanmycin', '17-AAG', '3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide', '4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole', ""5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide"", 'ANOVA', 'Apoptosis', 'BCA', 'CML', 'DAPI', 'DMSO', 'FBS', 'FITC', 'Hsp90', 'JC-1', 'Leukemia', 'MDR', 'MMP', 'MTT', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'P-glycoprotein', 'P-gp', 'PBS', 'PI', 'PVDF', 'SNX-2112', 'TUNEL', 'bicinchoninic acid', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dimethylsulfoxide', 'fetal bovine serum', 'fluorescein isothiocyanate', 'heat shock protein 90', 'mitochondrial transmembrane potential', 'multidrug resistance', 'one-way analysis of variance and covariance', 'phosphate-buffered saline', 'polyvinyl difluoride', 'propidium iodide', 'terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling']",2013/06/20 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(13)00146-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2013.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2013 Sep 5;205(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2013.06.007.

To define the molecular etiology of this disease, we have developed murine models of this disease, in syngeneic hosts as well as in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/interleukin 2Rgamma(null) mice engrafted with transformed human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Both murine models mimic the human disease with splenohepatomegaly, hypercellular bone marrow, and myeloproliferative neoplasms that progresses to acute myeloid leukemia. Molecular genetic analyses of these model mice, as well as primary human disease, demonstrated that CNTRL-FGFR1, through abnormal activation of several signaling pathways related to development and differentiation of both myeloid and T-lymphoid cells, contribute to overt leukemogenesis. Clonal evolution analysis indicates that myeloid related neoplasms arise from common myeloid precursor cells that retain potential for T-lymphoid differentiation. These data indicate that simultaneously targeting these pathways is essential to successfully treating this almost invariably lethal disease.","['Ren, Mingqiang', 'Qin, Haiyan', 'Kitamura, Eiko', 'Cowell, John K']","['Ren M', 'Qin H', 'Kitamura E', 'Cowell JK']","['Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, 1120 15th St, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. mren@gru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CNTRL protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/*genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",PMC3739028,,,2013/06/20 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/06/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56007-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-489823 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 8;122(6):1007-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-489823.

Here, we analyzed the clinical course and specificity of T cell immune responses in 2 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who converted to full-donor chimerism but developed severe acute GVHD after prophylactic CD4+ DLI after 10/10-HLA-matched, but HLA-DPB1-mismatched TCD-alloSCT. Clonal analysis of activated T cells isolated during GVHD demonstrated allo-reactivity exerted by CD4+ T cells directed against patient-mismatched HLA-DPB1 molecules on hematopoietic cells and skin-derived fibroblasts only when cultured under inflammatory conditions. At the time of CD4+ DLI, both patients contained residual patient-derived T cells, including cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells as a result of CMV reactivations. Once activated by CMV antigens, these CMV-specific T cells could stimulate HLA-DPB1-specific CD4+ T cells, which in turn could target nonhematopoietic tissues in GVHD. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GVHD after HLA-DPB1-mismatched CD4+ DLI can be mediated by allo-reactive HLA-DPB1-directed CD4+ T cells and that ongoing viral infections inducing HLA class II expression on nonhematopoietic cells may increase the likelihood of GVHD development.

Cognitive debriefing confirmed that the items were clear, relevant, and easy to use. One additional CML-specific symptom item was added, for a total of 7. The refined MDASI-CML was administered to 152 patients once every 2 weeks for 1 year. The content, concurrent, known-group, and construct validity of the MDASI-CML were evaluated. The internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities of the module were adequate. Longitudinal analysis showed relatively stable symptom severity scores over time. The most severe symptoms were fatigue, drowsiness, disturbed sleep, muscle soreness and cramping, and trouble remembering things. Approximately one-third of the patients who completed the MDASI-CML reported persistent moderate-to-severe symptoms.

A comparison of the expression in HA with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and healthy controls (HC) is made. Synovial expression of iron regulators was investigated by immunohistochemistry in human synovial tissue and in a murine haemophilia model. We demonstrate for the first time the synovial presence of the investigated iron regulator proteins. Expression of the iron regulator proteins FPN, CD163, FLVCR, and HCP-1 was enhanced in HA in comparison to RA, OA, and HC synovium. In addition, in a murine haemophilia model of acute joint bleeding, synovial expression of FPN, CD163, and HCP-1 was increased. In both human and murine experiment, synovial expression of hepcidin was not altered. These findings indicate the presence of iron regulator proteins in the synovium, demonstrate an enhanced expression of FPN, CD163, FLVCR, and HCP-1 in HA, and suggest a synovial adaptation mechanism to maintain synovial iron homeostasis in HA.","['Nieuwenhuizen, L', 'Schutgens, R E G', 'van Asbeck, B S', 'Wenting, M J', 'van Veghel, K', 'Roosendaal, G', 'Biesma, D H', 'Lafeber, F P J G']","['Nieuwenhuizen L', 'Schutgens RE', 'van Asbeck BS', 'Wenting MJ', 'van Veghel K', 'Roosendaal G', 'Biesma DH', 'Lafeber FP']","['Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. l.nieuwenhuizen@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Haemophilia,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,9442916,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hemarthrosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hemophilia A/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoarthritis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism/pathology', '*Up-Regulation']",,,,2013/06/20 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/06/20 06:00'],"['2013/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/hae.12208 [doi]'],ppublish,Haemophilia. 2013 Jul;19(4):e218-27. doi: 10.1111/hae.12208.,,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of EVI1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is frequently associated with 3q26 rearrangements and confers extremely poor prognosis. EVI1 mediates transcriptional regulation, signalling, and epigenetic modifications by interacting with DNA, proteins and protein complexes. To explore to what extent protein phosphorylation impacts on EVI1 functions, we analysed endogenous EVI1 protein from a high EVI1 expressing Fanconi anaemia (FA) derived AML cell line. Mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated EVI1 revealed phosphorylation at serine 196 (S196) in the sixth zinc finger of the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Mutated EVI1 with an aspartate substitution at serine 196 (S196D), which mimics serine phosphorylation of this site, exhibited reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional repression from a gene promotor selectively targeted by the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Forced expression of the S196D mutant significantly reduced EVI1 mediated transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts. While EVI1-mediated serial replating of murine haematopoietic progenitors was maintained by EVI1-S196D, this was associated with significantly higher Evi1-trancript levels compared with WT-EVI1 or EVI1-S196A, mimicking S196 non-phosphorylated EVI1. These data suggest that EVI1 function is modulated by phosphorylation of the first zinc finger domain.","['White, Daniel J', 'Unwin, Richard D', 'Bindels, Eric', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Teng, Hsiang-Ying', 'Muter, Joanne', 'Greystoke, Brigit', 'Somerville, Tim D', 'Griffiths, John', 'Lovell, Simon', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Meyer, Stefan']","['White DJ', 'Unwin RD', 'Bindels E', 'Pierce A', 'Teng HY', 'Muter J', 'Greystoke B', 'Somerville TD', 'Griffiths J', 'Lovell S', 'Somervaille TC', 'Delwel R', 'Whetton AD', 'Meyer S']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130612,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transformation, Genetic']",PMC3680417,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0066510 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-02553 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jun 12;8(6):e66510. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0066510.

Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) analysis was performed to build highly reliable and predictive CoMSIA models with cross-validated q(2) values of 0.816 and 0.702, respectively.

By cytogenetic investigations major subgroups of the disease can be identified that reflect different routes of tumor development. Of these chromosomal deviations, trisomy 12 and deletions of parts of either the long arm of chromosome 13, the long arm of chromosome 11, or the short arm of chromosome 17 are most commonly detected. In some of these aberrations the molecular target has been identified as eg, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in case of deletions of chromosomal region 11q22~23 and the genes encoding microRNAs miR-15a/16-1 as likely targets of deletions of chromosomal band 13q14.3. Of note, these aberrations do not characterize independent subgroups but often coexist within the metaphases of one tumor. Generally, complex aberrations are associated with a worse prognosis than simple karyotypic alterations. Due to smaller sizes of the missing segment the detection of recurrent deletions is not always possible by means of classical cytogenetics but requires more advanced techniques as in particular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Nevertheless, at this time it is not recommended to replace classical cytogenetics by FISH because this would miss additional information given by complex or secondary karyotypic alterations. However, the results of cytogenetic analyses allow the stratification of prognostic and predictive groups of the disease. Of these, the group characterized by deletions involving TP53 is clinically most relevant. In the future refined methods as eg, array-based comparative genomic hybridization will supplement the existing techniques to characterize CLL.","['Kiefer, Yvonne', 'Schulte, Christoph', 'Tiemann, Markus', 'Bullerdiek, Joern']","['Kiefer Y', 'Schulte C', 'Tiemann M', 'Bullerdiek J']","['Center for Human Genetics, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120312,New Zealand,Appl Clin Genet,The application of clinical genetics,101579789,,,,PMC3681189,['NOTNLM'],"['chromosomal abnormality', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'miRNA deregulation']",2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/TACG.S18669 [doi]', 'tacg-5-021 [pii]']",epublish,Appl Clin Genet. 2012 Mar 12;5:21-8. doi: 10.2147/TACG.S18669.

Thymocyte-selected CD4 (T-CD4) T cells have an innate-like phenotype similar to invariant NKT cells. To investigate the development and function of T-CD4 T cells in-depth, we cloned TCR genes from T-CD4 T cells and generated transgenic mice. Remarkably, positive selection of T-CD4 TCR transgenic (T3) thymocytes occurred more efficiently when MHC class II was expressed by thymocytes than by thymic epithelial cells. Similar to polyclonal T-CD4 T cells and also invariant NKT cells, T3 CD4 T cell development is controlled by signaling lymphocyte activation molecule/signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein signaling, and the cells expressed both IL-4 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF). Surprisingly, the selected T3 CD4 T cells were heterogeneous in that only half expressed IL-4 and only half expressed PLZF. IL-4- and PLZF-expressing cells were first found at the double-positive cell stage. Thus, the expression of IL-4 and PLZF seems to be determined by an unidentified event that occurs postselection and is not solely dependent on TCR specificity or the selection process, per se. Taken together, our data show for the first time, to our knowledge, that the TCR specificity regulates but does not determine the development of innate CD4 T cells by thymocytes.","['Zhu, Lingqiao', 'Qiao, Yu', 'Choi, Esther S', 'Das, Joy', ""Sant'angelo, Derek B"", 'Chang, Cheong-Hee']","['Zhu L', 'Qiao Y', 'Choi ES', 'Das J', ""Sant'angelo DB"", 'Chang CH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'Thymocytes/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",PMC3702648,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1300862 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1300862 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jul 15;191(2):737-44. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300862.

This is the first report to describe the clinical course of MTLE-HS observed longitudinally by EEG and MRI. Patient 1 experienced a seizure during chemotherapy involving intrathecal methotrexate. Postseizure MRI suggested methotrexate encephalopathy or leukemic invasion. Anticonvulsant therapy was initiated; subsequent EEGs and MRIs revealed normal results. Three years after chemotherapy, a diffuse, irregular spike-and-wave pattern was observed on interictal EEG. Five years after chemotherapy, the patient developed MTLE-HS comprising complex partial seizures, typical temporal spikes on EEG, and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patient 2 did not experience seizures during chemotherapy. Four years later, the patient started experiencing complex partial seizures, and a diffuse, irregular spike-and-wave pattern was observed on interictal EEG. A clinical picture of MTLE-HS developed 2 years later. In both patients, nonspecific EEG abnormalities (ie, diffuse, irregular spike-and-wave activity) preceded the appearance of HS on MRI by 2 years, suggesting an insidious advance of HS during the latent period. Such atypical EEG findings may indicate MTLE-HS during follow-up of leukemia patients. MTLE-HS develops several years after an initial precipitating incident such as prolonged seizures, central nervous system infection, and brain trauma. In our cases, the initial precipitating incident may have been chemotherapy and/or prolonged seizures. Thus, MTLE-HS associated with leukemia may not be as rare as generally believed.

We hypothesized that the prognosis of patients with unsatisfactory reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) can be improved by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Relapse Study of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group (ALL-REZ BFM) 2002, patients with an MRD level of >/= 10(-3) (n = 99) at the end of induction therapy were allocated to HSCT, whereas those with an MRD level less than 10(-3) (n = 109) continued to receive chemotherapy. MRD was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction for clone-specific T-cell receptor/immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. RESULTS: The probability of event-free survival for patients with MRD >/= 10(-3) was 64% +/- 5% in ALL-REZ BFM 2002 compared with 18% +/- 7% in the predecessor study ALL-REZ BFM P95/96 (P < .001). This was mainly achieved by reducing the cumulative incidence of subsequent relapse (CIR) at 8 years from 59% +/- 9% to 27% +/- 5% (P < .001). The favorable prognosis of patients with MRD less than 10(-3) could be confirmed in those with a late combined or isolated bone marrow B-cell precursor (BCP) -ALL relapse (CIR, 20% +/- 5%), whereas patients with an early combined BCP-ALL relapse had an unfavorable outcome (CIR, 63% +/- 13%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic HSCT markedly improved the prognosis of patients with intermediate risk of relapse of ALL and unsatisfactory MRD response. As a result, outcomes in this group approximated those of patients with favorable MRD response. Patients with early combined relapse require treatment intensification even in case of favorable MRD response, demonstrating the prognostic impact of time to relapse.","['Eckert, Cornelia', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Seeger, Karlheinz', 'Hagedorn, Nikola', 'Mann, Georg', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Peters, Christina', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'von Stackelberg, Arend']","['Eckert C', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K', 'Hagedorn N', 'Mann G', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Peters C', 'Klingebiel T', 'Borkhardt A', 'Schrappe M', 'Schrauder A', 'Escherich G', 'Sramkova L', 'Niggli F', 'Hitzler J', 'von Stackelberg A']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. cornelia.eckert@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.48.5680 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.48.5680 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jul 20;31(21):2736-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.48.5680.

This study aimed to determine whether there was cross-space-time clustering between different diagnostic groups. A total of 32,295 cases were diagnosed during 1969-1993. Cross-space-time clustering was analyzed by a second-order procedure based on Diggle's method. Locations were birth and diagnosis addresses. The following space-time combinations were examined: address and date of birth; address at birth and date of diagnosis; address and date of diagnosis. Cross-space-time clustering analyses considered clustering pairs of cases from two different diagnostic groups. Formal statistical significance was taken as p < 0.00067 and marginal significance 0.01 > p >/= 0.00067. Based on address at birth and date of diagnosis, there was statistically significant cross-clustering between cases of HL and intracranial and intraspinal embryonal tumors (IIET), both aged 0-14 years (p < 0.0001). Based on address and date of birth, there was marginally significant cross-clustering between cases of lymphoid leukemia (LL) aged 5-14 years and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) aged 0-14 years (p = 0.0019). Based on address and date of diagnosis there was marginally significant cross-clustering between cases of LL aged 1-4 years and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) aged 0-14 years (p = 0.0041). Findings from this study are consistent with possible common aetiological factors between different diagnostic groups. They suggest a common aetiology for the following pairs of diagnostic groups: HL and IIET; older cases of LL and HL; younger cases of LL and STS. The possibility of common infectious mechanisms should be explored.","['McNally, Richard J Q', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Vincent, Tim J', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","['McNally RJ', 'Stiller C', 'Vincent TJ', 'Murphy MF']","['Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, England, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC4232877,['NOTNLM'],"['Great Britain', 'aetiology', 'cancer', 'childhood', 'epidemiology', 'space-time clustering']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28332 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Jan 1;134(1):136-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28332.

As glucocorticoids influence hippocampal function, we investigated memory networks in survivors of childhood ALL treated with dexamethasone or prednisone. PROCEDURE: Neurocognitive assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted in 38 adult survivors randomly recruited from cohorts treated on one of two standard treatment protocols, which differed primarily in the glucocorticoid administered during continuation therapy (dexamethasone [n = 18] vs. prednisone [n = 20]). Groups did not differ in age at diagnosis, age at evaluation, or cumulative intravenous or intrathecal methotrexate exposure. RESULTS: Survivors treated with dexamethasone demonstrated lower performance on multiple memory-dependent measures, including story memory (P = 0.01) and word recognition (P = 0.04), compared to survivors treated with only prednisone. Dexamethasone treatment was associated with decreased fMRI activity in the left retrosplenial brain region (effect size = 1.3), though the small sample size limited statistical significance (P = 0.08). Story memory was associated with altered activation in left inferior frontal-temporal brain regions (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this pilot study suggest that adult survivors of ALL treated with dexamethasone are at increased risk for memory deficits and altered neural activity in specific brain regions and networks associated with memory function.","['Edelmann, Michelle N', 'Ogg, Robert J', 'Scoggins, Matthew A', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Edelmann MN', 'Ogg RJ', 'Scoggins MA', 'Brinkman TM', 'Sabin ND', 'Pui CH', 'Srivastava DK', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130618,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory/*drug effects', 'Memory Disorders/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC3928631,['NOTNLM'],"['fMRI', 'glucocorticoid', 'leukemia', 'memory', 'retrosplenium', 'survivors']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24644 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Nov;60(11):1778-84. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24644.

We conducted a prospective study to investigate the relationship between physical activity (PA) and sleep among children with cancer. PROCEDURE: Between 11/12/09 and 02/06/12, PA while awake and sleep variables were assessed by actigraphy collected over 7 days in 36 children (age range 8-18 years) with cancer (23 leukemia/lymphoma, 5 brain tumor, 8 solid tumor). Sleep diaries were used to determine sleep time, sleep quality, and morning mood. Fatigue was assessed at study initiation using fatigue instruments. RESULTS: Participants had impaired sleep based upon normative data compiled from multiple studies of more than 1,700 healthy children from 1 to 18 years of age [1], including decreased total sleep time (mean 6.6 hours, standard deviation (SD) 1.3 hours), increased wake after sleep onset (WASO; mean 2 hours, SD 1.4 hours), increased awakenings during sleep (mean 28.3 wake bouts, SD 7.8 bouts), and decreased sleep efficiency (mean 74.2%, SD 13.3%). Fatigue correlated with self-reported sleep quality but not with disturbances in sleep as measured by actigraphy. In longitudinal models that controlled for age, diagnosis group, gender, race, and steroid use, higher average activity, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with improved sleep quantity (P = 0.005) and efficiency (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pediatric oncology patients demonstrate impaired sleep. Greater PA was significantly associated with improved sleep quantity and efficiency in pediatric oncology participants. As a potentially modifiable factor, PA may offer a mechanism to improve sleep in pediatric oncology patients.","['Orsey, Andrea D', 'Wakefield, Dorothy B', 'Cloutier, Michelle M']","['Orsey AD', 'Wakefield DB', 'Cloutier MM']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut; Department of Pediatrics, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130618,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Actigraphy', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Fatigue/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Motor Activity', 'Neoplasms/*complications', '*Sleep']",,['NOTNLM'],"['actigraphy', 'pediatric oncology', 'physical activity', 'sleep']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24641 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Nov;60(11):1908-13. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24641.

Five structure-function rules emerged to identify analogs with enhanced anticancer activity. One of these active analogs, BXL-01-0126, was more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 in mediating 50% clonal inhibition of cancer cell growth. Murine studies found that BXL-01-0126 and 1,25(OH)2D3 had nearly the same potency to raise serum calcium levels. Taken together, BXL-01-0126 when compared to 1,25(OH)2D3 has greater anticancer potency, but similar toxicity causing hypercalcemia. We focused on the effect of these compounds on the stimulation of expression of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) whose gene has a vitamin D response element in its promoter. Expression of CAMP mRNA and protein increased in a dose-response fashion after exposure of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to the Gemini analog, BXL-01-126, in vitro. A xenograft model of AML was developed using U937 AML cells injected into NSG-immunodeficient mice. Administration of vitamin D3 compounds to these mice resulted in substantial levels of CAMP in the systemic circulation. This suggests a unique prophylactic treatment at diagnosis or during induction chemotherapy for AML patients to provide them with protection against various microbial infections through CAMP induction.","['Okamoto, Ryoko', 'Gery, Sigal', 'Kuwayama, Yoshio', 'Borregaard, Niels', 'Ho, Quoc', 'Alvarez, Rocio', 'Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Liu, George Y', 'Uskokovic, Milan R', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Okamoto R', 'Gery S', 'Kuwayama Y', 'Borregaard N', 'Ho Q', 'Alvarez R', 'Akagi T', 'Liu GY', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130716,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-21-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)vitamin D(3))', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cathelicidins)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '3DD771JO2H (ropocamptide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cathelicidins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,['NOTNLM'],"['antitumor', 'deuterated Gemini vitamin D3', 'human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide', 'vitamin D3']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28328 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Jan 1;134(1):207-17. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28328.

One of these spliceosomal genes, U2AF1, was affected by canonical somatic mutations in aggressive type of myeloid malignancies. We hypothesized that U2AF1 mutations causes defects of splicing (missplicing) in specific genes and that such misspliced genes might be important in leukemogenesis. We analyzed RNA deep sequencing to compare splicing patterns of 201 837 exons between the cases with U2AF1 mutations (n = 6) and wild type (n = 14). We identified different alternative splicing patterns in 35 genes comparing cells with mutant and wild-type U2AF1. U2AF1 mutations are associated with abnormal splicing of genes involved in functionally important pathways, such as cell cycle progression and RNA processing. In addition, many of these genes are somatically mutated or deleted in various cancers. Of note is that the alternative splicing patterns associated with U2AF1 mutations were associated with specific sequence signals at the affected splice sites. These novel observations support the hypothesis that U2AF1 mutations play a significant role in myeloid leukemogenesis due to selective missplicing of tumor-associated genes.","['Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Guinta, Kathryn', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Padgett, Richard', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Makishima, Hideki']","['Przychodzen B', 'Jerez A', 'Guinta K', 'Sekeres MA', 'Padgett R', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Makishima H']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Splicing Factor U2AF']",PMC3739042,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56006-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-480970 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 8;122(6):999-1006. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-480970.

The Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, is a key driver of cell survival in diverse cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A screen for compounds that downregulate Mcl-1 identified the kinase inhibitor, PIK-75, which demonstrates marked proapoptotic activity against a panel of cytogenetically diverse primary human AML patient samples. We show that PIK-75 transiently blocks Cdk7/9, leading to transcriptional suppression of MCL-1, rapid loss of Mcl-1 protein, and alleviation of its inhibition of proapoptotic Bak. PIK-75 also targets the p110alpha isoform of PI3K, which leads to a loss of association between Bcl-xL and Bak. The simultaneous loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL association with Bak leads to rapid apoptosis of AML cells. Concordantly, low Bak expression in AML confers resistance to PIK-75-mediated killing. On the other hand, the induction of apoptosis by PIK-75 did not require the expression of the BH3 proteins Bim, Bid, Bad, Noxa, or Puma. PIK-75 significantly reduced leukemia burden and increased the survival of mice engrafted with human AML without inducing overt toxicity.

USP10 is an antistress factor against various environmental stresses, including viral infections and oxidative stress. On exposure to arsenic, an oxidative stress inducer, USP10 is recruited into stress granules (SGs), and USP10-containing SGs reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibit ROS-dependent apoptosis. We found that interaction of Tax with USP10 inhibits arsenic-induced SG formation, stimulates ROS production, and augments ROS-dependent apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T cells. These findings suggest that USP10 is a host factor that inhibits stress-induced ROS production and apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T cells; however, its activities are attenuated by Tax. A clinical study showed that combination therapy containing arsenic is effective against some forms of ATL. Therefore, these findings may be relevant to chemotherapy against ATL.","['Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Makokha, Grace Naswa', 'Matsuki, Hideaki', 'Yoshita, Manami', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Takahashi M', 'Higuchi M', 'Makokha GN', 'Matsuki H', 'Yoshita M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (USP10 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/*metabolism/physiology']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56038-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-493718 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 1;122(5):715-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-493718.

Therefore, an early and accurate diagnosis may prove to be life saving in patients with the diagnosis of CA. In this report, a case of CA which developed in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is presented. Upon development of neutropenia and focal seizures in the left arm during implementation of the ALL treatment protocol, brain MRI was performed in the patient and nodular lesions compliant with brain abscess were detected in the frontal lobe, left cerebellum and the cingulate gyrus on the superior aspect of the left corpus callosum. Direct assessment of brain tissue revealed fungal elements, while consecutive serum galactomannan (GM) values were determined as 3.39 ng/ml and 0.72 ng/ml, and the consecutive serum (1x3)-beta-D-glucan (BG) values were 93 pg/ml and 356 pg/ml. Negative serum real-time polymerase chain reaction (RtPCR) and positive tissue RtPCR were determined, with growth of Aspergillus fumigatus in the culture. Treatment was initiated with amphotericin B and voriconazole; upon disappearance of symptoms and negative control serum BG and GM values, the patient was discharged with recommendations. In conclusion, this case is presented with the objective of indicating the significance of serological and molecular methods used in the early diagnosis of patients with CA.","['Sav, Hafize', 'Atalay, Mustafa Altay', 'Demir, Gonca', 'Akif Ozdemir, Mehmet', 'Nedret Koc, Ayse']","['Sav H', 'Atalay MA', 'Demir G', 'Akif Ozdemir M', 'Nedret Koc A']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Infez Med,Le infezioni in medicina,9613961,,IM,"['Brain Abscess/*diagnosis', 'Child, Preschool', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neuroaspergillosis/*diagnosis']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Infez Med. 2013 Jun;21(2):134-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: THP-1 cells were divided into control and PAAF groups. The PAAF group was incubated with different final concentrations of PAAF, whereas the control group was incubated with culture medium. Effects and mechanisms were determined by measuring the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression; phospho-p38-MAPK, nuclear factor kappaB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation; and the effect on the inhibitory activity of SB203580 and BAY-117082. RESULTS: In response to PAAF, overexpression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA was found in THP-1 cells compared with those of the corresponding control (P < 0.05), and in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of phospho-p38 and nuclear factor kappaB p65 were also increased in different PAAF groups, whereas low expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma was found compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we presented that the inflammatory response could be partly alleviated by inhibitors SB203580 or BAY-117082, whereas it was markedly inhibited by the simultaneous treatment of 2 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines by interfering with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways, thus exacerbating activation in acute pancreatitis.","['Wang, Jing', 'Xu, Ping', 'Hou, Yan-Qiang', 'Xu, Kai', 'Li, Qing-Hua', 'Huang, Ling']","['Wang J', 'Xu P', 'Hou YQ', 'Xu K', 'Li QH', 'Huang L']","[""Department of Gastroenterology, Songjiang Hospital Affiliated First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascitic Fluid/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Pancreatitis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPA.0b013e318279fe5c [doi]', '00006676-201307000-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Pancreas. 2013 Jul;42(5):855-60. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0b013e318279fe5c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, about 60% of T-ALL shows increased Notch1 activity, due to activating NOTCH1 mutations or alterations in the FBW7 gene, which confer to the cell a strong growth advantage. Therapeutic targeting of Notch signaling could be clinically relevant, especially for chemotherapy refractory patients. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a novel anti-Notch1 monoclonal antibody by taking advantage of a collection of pediatric T-ALL engrafted systemically in NOD/SCID mice and genetically characterized with respect to NOTCH1/FBW7 mutations. Anti-Notch1 treatment greatly delayed engraftment of T-ALL cells bearing Notch1 mutations, including samples derived from poor responders or relapsed patients. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-Notch1 therapy was significantly enhanced in combination with dexamethasone. Anti-Notch1 treatment increased T-ALL cell apoptosis, decreased proliferation and caused strong inhibitory effects on Notch-target genes expression along with complex modulations of gene expression profiles involving cell metabolism.

The differential diagnosis is difficult but critical for disease management. AIMS: We report 2 cases (1 adult and 1 infant) of precursor B-cell ALL who presented at diagnosis with surface immunoglobulin light chain expression revealed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping and discuss its clinical significance. CASE REPORT: The 2 patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, pallor, fatigue or lymphadenopathy. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed that both patients expressed CD34/CD19/CD10/CD22/CD9/HLA-DR/CD38/CD123/CD13 (partial) and had unexpected single lambda light chain expression. Cytogenetic analysis revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11) in the adult patient and normal karyotype in the infant. Both cases were diagnosed and managed as precursor B-ALL, and the patients showed good response to treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: We describe 2 cases of precursor B-ALL with unexpected surface light chain expression. The exceedingly rare immunophenotypes have diagnostic implication for immunophenotyping of this malignancy. Treatment regimens for precursor B-cell ALL are suitable for such cases.","['Liu, Yanhui', 'Zhai, Yaping', 'Zhang, Yin', 'Cheng, Wei', 'Li, Yulong']","['Liu Y', 'Zhai Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng W', 'Li Y']","[""Hematology Department, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, The People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20130611,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Asians', 'China', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology/therapy']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['000347165 [pii]', '10.1159/000347165 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2013;130(3):188-91. doi: 10.1159/000347165.

Cells constantly weigh up signals from their environment against their own integrity and metabolic status and decide whether to live or die. Such cell death decisions are central to the progression and treatment of cancer. The term autophagy describes three processes that deliver cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, the difference between each form being the method of delivery. The most extensively studied form is macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) where cytosolic components are engulfed by double membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form structures called autolysosomes, within which organelles, proteins and other macromolecules are degraded by catabolic enzymes in the acidic lysosome environment. Autophagy, which normally occurs at low levels in unstressed cells, is widely regarded as having a positive effect on cell health as potentially harmful protein aggregates and damaged organelles can be recycled. During periods of nutrient shortage autophagy is enhanced to provide, albeit temporarily, an internal energy source. Autophagy is also enhanced by other stresses encountered by tumour cells and this may protect the cell or aid its demise. In this review we examine the effect of autophagy on cell death decisions in tumour cells.","['Macintosh, Robin L', 'Ryan, Kevin M']","['Macintosh RL', 'Ryan KM']","['Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Glasgow G61 1BD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130614,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'CML', 'CQ', 'CTL', 'Cancer', 'Cell death', 'DAMP', 'ECM', 'HDACi', 'MOMP', 'PDAC', 'RCC', 'ROS', 'SAHA', 'TKi', 'chloroquine', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'cytotoxic T-lymphocyte', 'danger-associated molecular pattern', 'extracellular matrix', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'mitochondrial outer membrane permiabilisation', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'reactive oxygen species', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(13)00048-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2013 Oct;23(5):344-51. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.05.006.

Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n = 10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m(2)/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. There was significant maintained inhibition of PNP enzyme in red blood cells, accumulation of forodesine and dGuo in plasma, and intracellular dGTP accumulation in both patients. CONCLUSION: Our preclinical and clinical investigations suggest that forodesine has activity in B-ALL. However, it needs to be either infused with dGuo or combined with established chemotherapeutic agents based on mechanistic rationale.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Bantia, Shanta', 'Franklin, Anna', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Ravandi F', 'Bantia S', 'Franklin A', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130615,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC4102435,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Forodesine', 'dGTP']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(13)00143-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2013.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Aug;13(4):458-66. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2013.04.009.

RESULTS: According to the statistical analysis, a high level of beta2-microglobulin and unmutated IgHV emerged as factors significantly related to the presence of DAT positivity. Time to first TFS was significantly shorter in DAT-positive patients. The adverse effect of a DAT positive result was maintained in terms of TFS when patients with mutated IgHV status were excluded from statistical analysis.

Most DUBs are involved in regulation of intracellular processes including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, immunity, reproduction, and target gene transcription. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding the physiological functions of cytokine-inducible DUBs such as DUB-1, DUB-2, and DUB-3/USP17, in regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in lymphocytes. Here, we have summarized the structure and functions of cytokine-inducible DUBs and their biological functions in regulating several interleukin-associated signaling pathways.

Intrinsic apoptosis, the critical programmed cell death pathway that removes excess cells during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, follows a caspase cascade triggered at mitochondria and modulated by virus-encoded anti-apoptotic B cell leukemia (BCL)2-like suppressors. Extrinsic apoptosis controlled by caspase 8 arose during evolution to trigger executioner caspases directly, circumventing viral suppressors of intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis and providing the selective pressure for viruses to acquire caspase 8 suppressors. Programmed necrosis likely evolved most recently as a 'trap door' adaptation to extrinsic apoptosis. Receptor interacting protein (RIP)3 kinase (also called RIPK3) becomes active when either caspase 8 activity or polyubiquitylation of RIP1 is compromised.

METHODS: Trends in annual age-standardized rates per 100,000 from 1999 to 2009 were examined for MDS using multiple causes vs. underlying cause alone, coded on death certificates for U.S. residents. RESULTS: The death rate (all ages combined) for MDS increased from 1999 to 2009, from 1.62 to 1.84 using underlying cause alone and from 2.89 to 3.27 using multiple causes. Rates using multiple causes were about 80% higher than those based on underlying cause alone. From 2001 to 2004 the rate for MDS using underlying cause alone (but not using multiple causes) declined, accompanied by an increase in the rate for deaths from leukemia as underlying cause with mention of MDS; this trend coincided with the advent of the 2001 World Health Organization's reclassification of certain MDS as leukemia. The MDS rate for age 65+ years increased after 2005, whereas the rate for age 25-64 years was low but declined from 2001 to 2003 and then stabilized. For deaths with MDS coded as other than underlying cause, rates did not decline for deaths from each of the two most common causes (i.e., cardiovascular diseases and leukemia). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for decreases in MDS-related mortality rates was limited; the increase at age 65+ years is consistent with increases in incidence rates reported from cancer registries. Using multiple causes of death vs. only the underlying cause results in substantially higher MDS-related death rates, shows the impact of changes in the classification of myeloid neoplasms and emphasizes the importance of reducing cardiovascular disease mortality in MDS patients.","['Polednak, Anthony P']",['Polednak AP'],"['Connecticut Tumor Registry, Department of PublicHealth, Hartford, CT, USA. appoled7@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130615,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer mortality', 'Cancer surveillance', 'Leukemia', 'Multiple causes of death', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(13)00082-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2013.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2013 Oct;37(5):569-74. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2013.05.004.

Although complete remission rates by induction chemotherapy in ALL are now high, the long-term survival is still disappointing. Improvements in the survival outcome of ALL have been observed in young adults as a result of the use of pediatric inspired regimens and the broadening of the number of patients who are eligible for allogeneic SCT. Development of new and less toxic agents also provide promise to improve the outcome in adult ALL, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Ph-positive ALL, rituximab in CD20-positive disease, blinatumomab in precursor B-ALL and nelarabine in T-lineage ALL. Challenges for the future are to implement genomic profiling into the clinical setting to guide risk stratification and providing novel targets for tailored therapies.","['Zhao, Yanmin', 'Huang, He', 'Wei, Guoqing']","['Zhao Y', 'Huang H', 'Wei G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, No, 79 Qing Chun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130618,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3718656,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-40 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jun 18;6:40. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this may also be the result of the disease per se, increasing evidence suggests a role for miR-223 in limiting inflammation to prevent collateral damage during infection and in preventing oncogenic myeloid transformation. Validated targets for miR-223 that have effects on inflammation and infection include granzyme B, IKKalpha, Roquin and STAT3. With regard to cancer, validated targets include C/EBPbeta, E2F1, FOXO1 and NFI-A. The effect of miR-223 on these targets has been documented individually; however, it is more likely that miR-223 affects multiple targets simultaneously for key processes where the microRNA is important. Such processes include haematopoietic cell differentiation, particularly towards the granulocyte lineage (where miR-223 is abundant) and as cells progress down the myeloid lineage (where miR-223 expression decreases). NF-kappaB and the NLRP3 inflammasome are important inflammatory mechanisms that are dampened by miR-223 in these cell types. The miRNA can also directly target viruses such as HIV, leading to synergistic effects during infection. Here we review the recent studies of miR-223 function to show how it modulates inflammation, infection and cancer development.","['Haneklaus, M', 'Gerlic, M', ""O'Neill, L A J"", 'Masters, S L']","['Haneklaus M', 'Gerlic M', ""O'Neill LA"", 'Masters SL']","['Inflammation Research Group and Immunology Research Centre, School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130625,England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infections/*genetics', 'Inflammation/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",PMC7166861,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'infection', 'inflammation', 'miRNA-223']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/joim.12099 [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2013 Sep;274(3):215-26. doi: 10.1111/joim.12099.

By contrast, primary T-cell ALL specimens, which do not express CTGF, exhibited distinctive patterns of hypermethylation. Furthermore, we confirmed that global changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation can both functionally modulate CTGF expression in pre-B ALL cell lines.

The MLL-MLLT3 fusion transcript found in patients with AML harbouring t(9;11) is amenable to RT-qPCR quantification but because of the heterogeneity of translocation break points, the MLL-MLLT3 fusion gene is a challenging target. We hypothesised that MRD monitoring using MLL-MLLT3 as a RT-qPCR marker is feasible in the majority of patients with t(9;11)-positive AML. METHODS: Using a locked nucleic acid probe, we developed a sensitive RT-qPCR assay for quantification of the most common break point region of the MLL-MLLT3 fusion gene. Five paediatric patients with t(9;11)-positive AML were monitored using the MLL-MLLT3 assay. RESULTS: A total of 43 bone marrow (BM) and 52 Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from diagnosis until follow-up. Two patients relapsed, and both were MRD positive in BM after first induction course. A total of three relapses occurred, and they were detected by RT-qPCR 3 wks before haematological relapse was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: This MLL-MLLT3 RT-qPCR assay could be useful in MRD monitoring of a group of patients with AML who often lack reliable MRD markers.","['Abildgaard, Lotte', 'Ommen, Hans Beier', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg']","['Abildgaard L', 'Ommen HB', 'Lausen B', 'Hasle H', 'Nyvold CG']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131001,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (MLL-MLLT3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Probes/chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL-MLLT3', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'minimal residual disease; RT-qPCR']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12156 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Nov;91(5):394-8. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12156.

Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was used in 81%, cranial and/or spinal irradiation in 78%, and various systemic therapies [immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) (51%), cisplatin-based (DPACE; cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) (27%), bortezomib (19%), alkylators (11%), dexamethasone alone (8%), auto-transplant (5%)]. Median survival from CNS disease was only 4.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.8-6.7]; however, nine patients had prolonged survival (median: 17.1 months, 95% CI: 13.2-67.4). In general, these long-term survivors were treated with radiotherapy, multi-dosing IT chemotherapy, and IMiD-containing therapy. CNS MM is a highly aggressive disease but in our experience, long-term survival can be achieved with the combination of multi-dosing IT chemotherapy, radiation and IMiD-based therapy.","['Chen, Christine I', 'Masih-Khan, Esther', 'Jiang, Haiyan', 'Rabea, Ahmed', 'Cserti-Gazdewich, Christine', 'Jimenez-Zepeda, Victor H', 'Chu, Chia-Min', 'Kukreti, Vishal', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Tiedemann, Rodger', 'Tsang, Richard', 'Reece, Donna E']","['Chen CI', 'Masih-Khan E', 'Jiang H', 'Rabea A', 'Cserti-Gazdewich C', 'Jimenez-Zepeda VH', 'Chu CM', 'Kukreti V', 'Trudel S', 'Tiedemann R', 'Tsang R', 'Reece DE']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Haematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada. christine.chen@uhn.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130615,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'VAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Orbit/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', '*Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Spine/pathology', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['central nervous system', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'intrathecal chemotherapy', 'leptomeningeal', 'multiple myeloma']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12414 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Aug;162(4):483-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12414.

This translocation causes expression of the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) fusion protein, which cooperates with additional mutations in leukemia development. We report here that interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes are a group of genes consistently up-regulated by RUNX1-ETO in both human and murine models. RUNX1-ETO-induced up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes occurs primarily via type I IFN signaling with a requirement for the IFNAR complex. Addition of exogenous IFN in vitro significantly reduces the increase in self-renewal potential induced by both RUNX1-ETO and its leukemogenic splicing isoform RUNX1-ETO9a. Finally, loss of type I IFN signaling via knockout of Ifnar1 significantly accelerates leukemogenesis in a t(8;21) murine model. This demonstrates the role of increased IFN signaling as an important factor inhibiting t(8;21) fusion protein function and leukemia development and supports the use of type I IFNs in the treatment of AML.","['DeKelver, Russell C', 'Lewin, Benjamin', 'Weng, Stephanie', 'Yan, Ming', 'Biggs, Joseph', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['DeKelver RC', 'Lewin B', 'Weng S', 'Yan M', 'Biggs J', 'Zhang DE']",['Division of Biological Sciences.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130725,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3987666,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.815351 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Apr;55(4):884-91. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.815351.

The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and economic characteristics of RS within inpatient hospital settings in the United States from 2001 to 2010. This retrospective cohort study employed data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Overall, 46 613 cases of RS were observed across 695 080 inpatient cases of CLL, representing a national bill of $2.74 billion and involving a 9.3% inpatient mortality rate. Multivariate analyses found decreased national inpatient mortality from 2001 to 2010 of - 61.1% (p < 0.001), shorter length of stay of - 15.5% (p < 0.001) and higher charges of +20.9% (p = 0.003). Numerous characteristics were also associated with increased likelihoods of death, lengths of stay and charges. Clinically, the findings allow for an increased understanding of population-based RS case-mixes, outcome prediction and clinical risk assessments. The continued burden of illness of either RS or CLL ultimately remains contingent upon the comparative- and cost-effectiveness of both existing interventions and those in development.","['Skrepnek, Grant H', 'Tate, Wendy R', 'Baker, Amanda F']","['Skrepnek GH', 'Tate WR', 'Baker AF']",['The University of Arizona Cancer Center.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130729,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', '*Cost of Illness', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', '*Inpatients', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2013/06/19 06:00'],"['2013/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.814128 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Apr;55(4):834-40. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.814128.

The M2 subunit of RR is known to increase in tandem with progression of cells into S phase, whereas the M1 subunit is expressed at steady-state. Since the expression level of the M2 subunit increases because the cells need deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for replication, it is logical to hypothesize that the same increase will be seen during DNA repair. To test this, we used chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, which are replicationally quiescent and have low endogenous levels of RR and dNTPs. Cyclophosphamide was selected as the DNA damaging agent because of its clinical use in the treatment of CLL. DNA repair, measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation after 4 h treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, increased in a dose-dependent manner at 3, 10 and 50 muM. The induction of DNA repair concomitantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of M2 subunit (median 1.6-fold; range 0.9-5.3).

The AHR is expressed in multiple tumor types, in cancer cell lines, and in tumors from animal models, and the function of the AHR has been determined by RNA interference, overexpression, and inhibition studies. With few exceptions, knockdown of the AHR resulted in decreased proliferation and/or invasion and migration of cancer cell lines, and in vivo studies in mice overexpressing the constitutively active AHR exhibited enhanced stomach and liver cancers, suggesting a pro-oncogenic role for the AHR. In contrast, loss of the AHR in transgenic mice that spontaneously develop colonic tumors and in carcinogen-induced liver tumors resulted in increased carcinogenesis, suggesting that the receptor may exhibit antitumorigenic activity prior to tumor formation. AHR ligands also either enhanced or inhibited tumorigenesis, and these effects were highly tumor specific, demonstrating that selective AHR modulators that exhibit agonist or antagonist activities represent an important new class of anticancer agents that can be directed against multiple tumors.","['Safe, Stephen', 'Lee, Syng-Ook', 'Jin, Un-Ho']","['Safe S', 'Lee SO', 'Jin UH']","['Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-4466, USA. ssafe@cvm.tamu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20130614,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/etiology', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/toxicity', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC3748760,['NOTNLM'],"['Ah receptor', 'agonist activity', 'antagonist activity', 'drug target.']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['kft128 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kft128 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2013 Sep;135(1):1-16. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kft128.

The purpose of present study was to establish the xenotransplantation model in NOD/SCID mice with FLT3-ITD (mut) /NPM1 (-) CN-AML primary cells. The FLT3-ITD (mut) /NPM1 (-) CN-AML primary cells from 3 of 7 cases were successfully transplanted into NOD/SCID mice, and human CD45 positive cells were detected in the peripheral blood, spleen and bone marrow of mice by using flow cytometry. Infiltration of human leukemia cells in various organs of mice was observed by using immunohistochemistry. Gene analysis confirmed sustained FLT3/ITD mutation without NPM1 mutation in mice. By performing serial transplantation, it was found that characteristics of the leukemia cells in secondary and tertiary generation models remained unchanged. Moreover, in vivo cytarabine administration could extend survival of NOD/SCID mice, which was consistent with clinical observation. In conclusion, we successfully established xenotransplantation model of human FLT3-ITD (mut) /NPM1 (-) CN-AML in NOD/SCID mice.

However, in many cases the antibodies used for the treatment of tumors offer only a modest survival benefit to cancer patients. AIMS: In the present review-article we intend to analyze: i) the curative regimen gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) -mediate characterized by the absence of cytotoxic drugs MDR1-Pgp substrates to overcome the mechanism of action of this multidrug transporter, ii) the safety and efficacy of MDR reversing strategy in AML outcome and, iii) chemical and biological MDR modulators playing a dual relevant medical role as a therapeutic and MDR reversing agents but not yet entered in the clinical setting of AML. Since the similar multidrug transporter protein MDR1-Pgp and its down modulation factors may affect safety and efficacy of already generated antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) a comprehensive overview of the most clinically representative immunoconjugates is reported. DISCUSSION: ADCs represent one of the most promising strategies to enhance the antitumor activity of antibodies. ADCs comprise an antibody (or an antibody fragment) conjugated to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker. The therapeutic concept of ADCs is to use an antibody as a vehicle to selectively delivering a cytotoxic drug specifically to a tumor cell, in most cases by means of binding to target cell surface antigen. As a consequence, ADCs have significant potential for enhancing the antitumor activity of ""naked"" antibodies and reducing the systemic toxicity of the conjugated drugs.","['Cianfriglia, Maurizio']",['Cianfriglia M'],"['Dipartimento del Farmaco, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. maurizio.cianfriglia@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Ann Ist Super Sanita,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,7502520,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Young Adult']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4415/ANN_13_02_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2013;49(2):190-208. doi: 10.4415/ANN_13_02_11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the emergence of MDR1-Pgp mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR) it is a biological phenomenon that inhibits the curative potential of chemotherapeutic treatments. One way to improve the selectivity of therapeutic molecules in tumors would be to target them on the tumor site, thereby sparing normal tissues. AIMS: In this overview, we will discuss the biological factors influencing the safety and efficacy of the humanized mAb hP67.6 linked to the potent cytotoxic drug calicheamicingamma1 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) that target CD33 cell surface antigen expressed on AML cells. In addition, we highlight key aspects of MDR1-Pgp biology as a platform to understand its functional role in gemtuzumab ozogamicin immunotherapy which is tightly linked to an accurate assessment of the MDR status of AML cells. DISCUSSION: Several factors may affect the efficacy and safety of immunoconjugates. These include the common issues of chemical and antibody therapeutics such as specificity, heterogeneous target antigen expression and the complex pharmacokinetics profile of conveyed antibody. Further, the delivered drug may not be sufficient for providing therapeutic benefit, since the curative cytotoxic compound may be affected by intrinsic or acquired resistance of target cells. These and other potential problems, as well as the possible ways to overcome them will be discussed in this review by examining the biological factors involved in safety and efficacy of the first in class antibody drug conjugate (ADC) gentuzumab ozogamicin. Despite this set-back, the extensive recorded data and the lessons learned from gentuzumab ozogamicin recently withdrawn from the market for safety concerns helped to pave the way for next generations of clinically promising new ADCs which are currently investigated in clinical trials and two of them, Brentuximab vedotin, and Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) have been recently approved for commercial distribution in US by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","['Cianfriglia, Maurizio']",['Cianfriglia M'],"['Dipartimento del Farmaco, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. maurizio.cianfriglia@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Italy,Ann Ist Super Sanita,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,7502520,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*immunology/*physiology', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Aging/physiology', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Immunotoxins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Safety']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4415/ANN_13_02_07 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2013;49(2):150-68. doi: 10.4415/ANN_13_02_07.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicities were acceptable, with transient hyperbilirubinemia (48%) and gr3-4 infections (10%). In all, 28/29 proceeded to transplant; 27 received ATG or alemtuzumab. Post HCT, 180 day non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-21), relapse was 29% (95% CI: 13-46) and OS was 71% (95% CI: 51-85), comparing favorably to published data for high-risk patients. Two-year graft vs host disease incidence was 40% (95% CI: 21-58) and 2 year OS was 31% (95% CI: 14-48). Disease at the nadir correlated with inferior OS after HCT (HR=1.22 for each 10% marrow blasts, 95% CI: 1.02-1.46). For AML/MDS patients, there was a suggestion that successful cytoreduction increased PFS (330 vs 171 days, P=0.3) and OS (375 vs 195 days, P=0.31). Clofarabine used as a bridge to HCT reduces disease burden, is well tolerated, and permits high-risk patients to undergo HCT with acceptable NRM. Late relapses are common; thus, additional strategies should be pursued.

It has been established that impairment of the immunoproteasome subunits, that is, PSMB8, PSMB9 and PSMB10 (PSMBs), is critical for malignant cells to escape immune recognition. We report here the regulatory mechanism of the repression of PU.1-dependent activation of PSMBs by PML/RARalpha in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the unidentified function of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as an immunomodulator in the treatment of APL. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays showed that PU.1 directly bound to and coordinately transactivated the promoters of PSMBs, indicating that PSMBs were transcriptional targets of PU.1 and PU.1 regulated their basal expression. Analysis of expression profiling data from a large population of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients revealed that the expression levels of PSMBs were significantly lower in APL patients than in non-APL AML patients. Further evidence demonstrated that the decrease in their expression was achieved through PML/RARalpha-mediated repression of both PU.1-dependent transactivation and PU.1 expression. Moreover, ATRA but not arsenic trioxide induced the expression of PSMBs in APL cells, indicating that ATRA treatment might activate the antigen-processing/presentation machinery. Finally, the above observations were confirmed in primary APL samples. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PML/RARalpha suppresses PU.1-dependent activation of the immunosubunits, which may facilitate the escape of APL cells from immune surveillance in leukemia development, and ATRA treatment is able to reactivate their expression, which would promote more efficient T-cell-mediated recognition in the treatment.","['Yang, X-W', 'Wang, P', 'Liu, J-Q', 'Zhang, H', 'Xi, W-D', 'Jia, X-H', 'Wang, K-K']","['Yang XW', 'Wang P', 'Liu JQ', 'Zhang H', 'Xi WD', 'Jia XH', 'Wang KK']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130617,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (LMP7 protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptome', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013224 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.224 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 May 22;33(21):2700-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.224.

METHODS: cross-sectional study was conducted in the Hematologic Outpatient Clinic, Dr. Soetomo Hospital Surabaya in all chronic phase CML patients from June 2008 to June 2012. Data on subject characteristics (age and sex), complete blood count with differential and spleen size were collected. Patients were stratified according to Sokal score at diagnosis. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to monitor BCR-ABL levels in patients who fulfilled study. Proportion difference of complete molecular response (MR) was analyzed by chi-square test, while differences of BCR-ABL transcript level among Sokal prognostic scole subgroups was analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: 40 subjects finished the study. After 18 months of Imatinib treatment, the undetected BCR-ABL transcript level (complete MR) were 7(70%), 8(66.7%), and 9(50%) in low-, intermediate-, and high risk group patients, respectively (p=0.417). Although proportion of subjects with complete MR is higher in sokal low risk group compared to in sokal high risk groups (70% v.s. 50%), but this difference is not statistically significant (p=0.557). Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was no significant difference of BCR-ABL transcript level among Sokal prognostic score subgroup (p=0.734). CONCLUSION: there was no difference of BCR-ABL transcript level among sokal prognostic score risk groups in chronic phase CML patients treated with Imatinib.","['Ashariati, Ami', 'Ugroseno, S']","['Ashariati A', 'Ugroseno S']","['Department Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Airlangga University-Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. amiashariati@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Indonesia,Acta Med Indones,Acta medica Indonesiana,7901042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Indones. 2013 Apr;45(2):107-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One strategy explores antibodies and their drug conjugates, particularly those targeting CD33. Emerging data with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) demonstrate target validity and activity in some patients with AML, but efficacy is limited by heterogeneous drug conjugation, linker instability, and a high incidence of multidrug resistance. We describe here the development of SGN-CD33A, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody with engineered cysteines conjugated to a highly potent, synthetic DNA cross-linking pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer via a protease-cleavable linker. The use of engineered cysteine residues at the sites of drug linker attachment results in a drug loading of approximately 2 pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers per antibody. In preclinical testing, SGN-CD33A is more potent than GO against a panel of AML cell lines and primary AML cells in vitro and in xenotransplantation studies in mice. Unlike GO, antileukemic activity is observed with SGN-CD33A in AML models with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Mechanistic studies indicate that the cytotoxic effects of SGN-CD33A involve DNA damage with ensuing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Together, these data suggest that SGN-CD33A has CD33-directed antitumor activity and support clinical testing of this novel therapeutic in patients with AML.","['Kung Sutherland, May S', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Jeffrey, Scott C', 'Burke, Patrick J', 'Yu, Changpu', 'Kostner, Heather', 'Stone, Ivan', 'Ryan, Maureen C', 'Sussman, Django', 'Lyon, Robert P', 'Zeng, Weiping', 'Harrington, Kimberly H', 'Klussman, Kerry', 'Westendorf, Lori', 'Meyer, David', 'Bernstein, Irwin D', 'Senter, Peter D', 'Benjamin, Dennis R', 'Drachman, Jonathan G', 'McEarchern, Julie A']","['Kung Sutherland MS', 'Walter RB', 'Jeffrey SC', 'Burke PJ', 'Yu C', 'Kostner H', 'Stone I', 'Ryan MC', 'Sussman D', 'Lyon RP', 'Zeng W', 'Harrington KH', 'Klussman K', 'Westendorf L', 'Meyer D', 'Bernstein ID', 'Senter PD', 'Benjamin DR', 'Drachman JG', 'McEarchern JA']","['Department of Research & Translational Medicine, Seattle Genetics Inc., Bothell, WA 98021, USA. msutherland@seagen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130614,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzodiazepines/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cysteine/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Design', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*chemistry']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)54244-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-491506 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Aug 22;122(8):1455-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-491506.

NF-kappaB signaling has a major role in innate immunity defense while SIRT1 regulates the oxidative respiration and cellular survival. However, NF-kappaB signaling can stimulate glycolytic energy flux during acute inflammation, whereas SIRT1 activation inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and enhances oxidative metabolism and the resolution of inflammation. SIRT1 inhibits NF-kappaB signaling directly by deacetylating the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB complex. SIRT1 stimulates oxidative energy production via the activation of AMPK, PPARalpha and PGC-1alpha and simultaneously, these factors inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and suppress inflammation. On the other hand, NF-kappaB signaling down-regulates SIRT1 activity through the expression of miR-34a, IFNgamma, and reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of SIRT1 disrupts oxidative energy metabolism and stimulates the NF-kappaB-induced inflammatory responses present in many chronic metabolic and age-related diseases. We will examine the molecular mechanisms of the antagonistic signaling between NF-kappaB and SIRT1 and describe how this crosstalk controls inflammatory process and energy metabolism. In addition, we will discuss how disturbances in this signaling crosstalk induce the appearance of chronic inflammation in metabolic diseases.","['Kauppinen, Anu', 'Suuronen, Tiina', 'Ojala, Johanna', 'Kaarniranta, Kai', 'Salminen, Antero']","['Kauppinen A', 'Suuronen T', 'Ojala J', 'Kaarniranta K', 'Salminen A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

We analyzed the characteristics of patients in whom treatment with first-line 2G-TKIs had failed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 218 patients with CML were treated with dasatinib (n = 101) or nilotinib (n = 117; 12 in AP). After a median follow-up of 23 months, 40 patients (18%) discontinued therapy: 25 initially treated with nilotinib (21% of all treated with nilotinib; 6 treated in AP) and 15 (15%) initially treated with dasatinib. Median age of the patients was 47 (range, 19-79) years, and they had received therapy for a median of 8 (range, 0-62) months. RESULTS: Reasons for treatment discontinuation include: toxicity, 16 patients; resistance in CP, 5 patients; transformation to blast phase, 4 patients (2 treated in AP); and other reasons, 15 patients. Subsequent treatment was imatinib in 11 patients, nilotinib in 7, dasatinib in 4, ponatinib in 2, chemotherapy plus dasatinib in 3, stem cell transplant in 2, bafetinib in 1, and unknown or none in 8 patients. A complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 19 patients, including 17 with major molecular response. Fourteen of the patients who achieved a complete molecular response or major molecular response with subsequent TKIs were in CP at the time of 2G-TKI discontinuation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that treatment failure after first-line therapy with 2G-TKIs is mostly associated with toxicity or patient preference, and these patients respond well to alternative TKIs.","['Eghtedar, Alireza', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Burton, Elizabeth', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Eghtedar A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Burton E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Konopleva M', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130614,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3752280,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Dasatinib', 'Discontinuation', 'Nilotinib', 'TKIs']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(13)00108-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Aug;13(4):477-84. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.025.

Despite its importance in oncogenesis, the regulatory factors and mechanisms that potentiate the function of EVI1 and its consequences are partially known. Here we demonstrated that EVI1 is post-translationally modified by SUMO1 at lysine residues 533, 698 and 874. Although both EVI1 and SUMO1 were found to co-localize in nuclear speckles, the sumoylation mutant of EVI1 failed to co-localize with SUMO1. Sumoylation abrogated the DNA binding efficiency of EVI1 and also affected EVI1 mediated transactivation. The SUMO ligase PIASy was found to play a bi-directional role on EVI1, PIASy enhanced EVI1 sumoylation and augmented sumoylated EVI1 mediated repression. PIASy was also found to interact with EVI1 and impaired EVI1 transcriptional activity independent of its ligase activity. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) known to act as an antileukemic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) not only enhanced EVI1 sumoylation but also enhanced the co-localization of EVI1 and SUMO1 in nuclear bodies distinct from PML nuclear bodies. ATO treatment also affected the Bcl-xL protein expression in EVI1 positive cell line. Thus, the results showed that arsenic treatment enhanced EVI1 sumoylation, deregulated Bcl-xL, which eventually may induce apoptosis in EVI1 positive cancer cells. The study for the first time explores and reports sumoylation of EVI1, which plays an essential role in regulating its function.","['Singh, Sneha', 'Pradhan, Anjan Kumar', 'Chakraborty, Soumen']","['Singh S', 'Pradhan AK', 'Chakraborty S']","['Department of Gene Function and Regulation, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide (ATO)', 'Bcl-xL', 'EVI1', 'PIASy', 'SIRT1', 'Sumoylation']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00226-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Oct;1833(10):2357-68. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.06.003.

In this study, real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of catalase (cat) was significantly repressed during MK differentiation of K562 cells induced by PMA. In addition, PMA increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, suggesting that ROS was a key factor for PMA-induced differentiation. PMA-differentiated K562 cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to clarify the function of ROS during MK differentiation. Interestingly, the percentage of high-ploidy (DNA content >4N) cells with H2O2 was 34.8+/-2.3% at day 9, and was 70% larger than that without H2O2 (21.5+/-0.8%). Further, H2O2 addition during the first 3 days of PMA-induced MK differentiation had the greatest effect on polyploidization. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of enhanced polyploidization by H2O2, the BrdU assay clearly indicated that H2O2 suppressed the division of 4N cells into 2N cells, followed by the increased polyploidization of K562 cells. These findings suggest that the enhancement in polyploidization mediated by H2O2 is due to synergistic inhibition of cytokinesis with PMA. Although H2O2 did not increase ploidy during the MK differentiation of primary cells, we clearly observed that cat expression was repressed in both immature and mature primary MK cells, and that treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively blocked and/or delayed the polyploidization of immature MK cells. Together, these findings suggest that MK cells are more sensitive to ROS levels during earlier stages of maturation.","['Ojima, Yoshihiro', 'Duncan, Mark Thompson', 'Nurhayati, Retno Wahyu', 'Taya, Masahito', 'Miller, William Martin']","['Ojima Y', 'Duncan MT', 'Nurhayati RW', 'Taya M', 'Miller WM']","['Division of Chemical Engineering, Department of Materials Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, 1-3 Machikaneyama-cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan. ojima@cheng.es.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Catalase/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokinesis/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Polyploidy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",PMC3771872,['NOTNLM'],"['Catalase down-regulation', 'Hydrogen peroxide', 'K562 cell', 'Megakaryocytic differentiation', 'Polyploidization', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(13)00252-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2013 Aug 15;319(14):2205-15. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.06.002.

We found that Integrin Beta 3 (Itgb3) is essential for murine leukemia cells in vivo and for human leukemia cells in xenotransplantation studies. In leukemia cells, Itgb3 knockdown impaired homing, downregulated LSC transcriptional programs, and induced differentiation via the intracellular kinase Syk. In contrast, loss of Itgb3 in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells did not affect engraftment, reconstitution, or differentiation. Finally, using an Itgb3 knockout mouse model, we confirmed that Itgb3 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis but is required for leukemogenesis. Our results establish the significance of the Itgb3 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Miller, Peter G', 'Al-Shahrour, Fatima', 'Hartwell, Kimberly A', 'Chu, Lisa P', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Puram, Rishi V', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Callahan, Kevin P', 'Ashton, John', 'McConkey, Marie E', 'Poveromo, Luke P', 'Cowley, Glenn S', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Labelle, Myriam', 'Shterental, Sebastian', 'Fujisaki, Joji', 'Silberstein, Lev', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Al-Hajj, Muhammad A', 'Shelton, Christopher A', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Root, David E', 'Scadden, David T', 'Hynes, Richard O', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Miller PG', 'Al-Shahrour F', 'Hartwell KA', 'Chu LP', 'Jaras M', 'Puram RV', 'Puissant A', 'Callahan KP', 'Ashton J', 'McConkey ME', 'Poveromo LP', 'Cowley GS', 'Kharas MG', 'Labelle M', 'Shterental S', 'Fujisaki J', 'Silberstein L', 'Alexe G', 'Al-Hajj MA', 'Shelton CA', 'Armstrong SA', 'Root DE', 'Scadden DT', 'Hynes RO', 'Mukherjee S', 'Stegmaier K', 'Jordan CT', 'Ebert BL']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130613,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/physiology']",PMC3746037,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(13)00197-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2013.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2013 Jul 8;24(1):45-58. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2013.05.004.

It can also be used to prevent and treat hepatitis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and arteriosclerosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to compare the biological activities such as melanin synthesis inhibitory, anti-allergy, anti-lipase, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective activities of different parts of the plant that may justify the use of this plant in folk medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The roots, stems, leaves and, seeds of Angelica shikokiana were separately extracted with water and ethanol. Each extract was examined for melanin synthesis inhibitory and anti-allergy activity on B16-melanoma and RBL-2H3 cells using IgE and A23187 as a stimulant for beta-hexosaminidase release, respectively. We also evaluated the inhibition of two enzymes, lipase and acetylcholine esterase, and of the bacterial growth of two species, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureaus. The anti-oxidant activity was determined using oxygen radical anti-oxidant capacity, ORAC assay and its relation to the phenolic content was estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Besides, the protective effect of the extracts against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in mouse neuroblastoma, Neuro-2A cells was investigated. RESULTS: The most active extract exhibiting melanin synthesis inhibition (63%) and at the same time with low cytotoxicity (15%) was the ethanol extract of roots at 20 microg/ml, followed by the ethanol extract of stems (57% inhibition, 5% cytotoxicity). On the other hand, the highest inhibitions of beta-hexosaminidase release were recorded for the ethanol extract of leaves with IC50 value of 6.89 microg/ml followed by the water extract of the seeds and leaves with IC50 value of 78.32 and 88.44 microg/ml, respectively. For anti-lipase assay, ethanol extracts of the stems and roots showed the strongest inhibition with IC50 values of 204.06 and 216.24 microg/ml, respectively. None of the examined extracts showed any activity against Escherichia coli. while the ethanol extract of the roots and stems showed moderate inhibition for Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration of 400 microg/ml. Ethanol extract of the roots showed only 30% inhibition of acetylcholine esterase enzyme. The results of anti-oxidant, phenolic content and protective effect against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity assays showed highly correlated data. Ethanol extract of the stems (ORAC value of 1.08 micromol Trolox/mg and phenolic content 44.25 mug GAE/mg) increased the cell viability of H2O2-treated Neuro-2A cells by 28%.","['Mira, Amira', 'Tanaka, Akinobu', 'Tateyama, Yumie', 'Kondo, Ryuichiro', 'Shimizu, Kuniyoshi']","['Mira A', 'Tanaka A', 'Tateyama Y', 'Kondo R', 'Shimizu K']","['Division of Systematic Forest and Forest Products Sciences, Department of agro-environmental sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School of Kyushu University, 812-8581, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20130612,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Melanins)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '18323-58-5 (4-methylumbelliferyl oleate)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['*Angelica', 'Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Hymecromone/analogs & derivatives', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Melanins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenols/analysis', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Rats', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin', '5,5-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid]', '6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid', 'AAPH', 'AChE', 'AChEI', 'Angelica shikokiana', 'Anti-allergy', 'Anti-lipase', 'Anti-oxidant', 'DNP-BSA', 'DTNB', 'EMEM', ""Eagle's minimal essential medium"", 'FBS', 'LE', 'LW', 'MTT', 'Melanin synthesis inhibitory', 'Neuro-2A', 'Neuroprotective', 'PBS', 'RBL', 'RE', 'RW', 'SE', 'STW', 'SW, water extract of seeds.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with leukemia who underwent skin biopsy for new lesions and clinical suspicion of infection over 4 years. Biopsy was considered to have changed the diagnosis, if the results differed from the prior leading clinical impression. RESULTS: Seventy-six (39%) of 195 patients had infections identified via skin biopsy. Among the remaining patients, the most common diagnoses were leukemia cutis, drug reactions and Sweet's syndrome. Ulcerated or necrotic lesions and bacteremia or fungemia were the only independent predictors of infection. 55% of patients with severe neutropenia had biopsy-proven infectious causes of their skin lesions. One third of all afebrile patients had skin manifestations owing to infection. Skin biopsy results differed from the initial clinical impression in 34% of all patients. In 45% of infected patients, pathogens were identified by skin biopsy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Noninfectious causes accounted for a large proportion of new skin lesions in leukemia patients with suspected infections. Absence of neutropenia or fever did not rule out infection. Ulcerated or necrotic lesions and bacteremia or fungemia were independent predictors of infection. In the evaluation of patients with leukemia and new skin lesions, skin biopsy remains an important procedure to rule out infection, and is particularly useful for pathogen identification.","['Farmakiotis, Dimitrios', 'Ciurea, Ana Mercedes', 'Cahuayme-Zuniga, Lizbeth', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Farmakiotis D', 'Ciurea AM', 'Cahuayme-Zuniga L', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. dfarmakiotis@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20130614,England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Communicable Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cellulitis', 'Immunocompromised host', 'Leukemia', 'Rash', 'Skin biopsy', ""Sweet's syndrome""]",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0163-4453(13)00149-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinf.2013.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2013 Oct;67(4):265-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2013.06.004.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes of patients with relapsed APL who were treated at our institution (1980-2010) and who received HCT were compared with those who received chemotherapy (CT) only. RESULTS: Among 40 patients, 24 received HCT (autologous [auto] HCT, 7; allogeneic [allo] HCT, 14; both, 3); 16 received CT only. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years (range, 13-50 years), 31 years (range, 16-58 years), and 44 years (range, 24-79 years) for the auto-HCT, allo-HCT, and CT groups, respectively. Ten (100%) patients who received auto-HCT and 12 (71%) who received allo-HCT were in complete remission at the time of the HCT. The median follow-ups in the auto-HCT, allo-HCT, and CT groups were 74 months (range, 26-135 months), 118 months (range, 28-284 months), and 122 months (range, 32-216 months), respectively. Transplantation-related mortality (1 year) after auto-HCT and allo-HCT were 10% and 29%, respectively. The 7-year event-free survival after auto-HCT and allo-HCT was 68.6% and 40.6%, respectively (P = .45). The 7-year overall survival was 85.7%, 49.4%, and 40% in the auto-HCT, allo-HCT, and CT groups, respectively (P = .48). CONCLUSION: Both auto-HCT and allo-HCT are associated with durable remission and prolonged survival. All 3 strategies (auto-HCT, allo-HCT, CT) were found to be feasible in the relapsed APL setting and result in long-term disease control in selected patients. In this retrospective analysis, overall survival for patients who received HCT was not significantly better than patients who received CT only, but a trend toward better outcomes was seen in patients who underwent auto-HCT, although not statistically significant.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Tanaka, Maria Florencia', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Lin, Heather', 'Baladandayuthapani, Veerabhadran', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'De Lima, Marcos', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Tanaka MF', 'Ravandi F', 'Lin H', 'Baladandayuthapani V', 'Rondon G', 'Giralt SA', 'Chen J', 'Pierce S', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Champlin RE', 'De Lima M', 'Qazilbash MH']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130613,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4112369,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Allogeneic transplantation', 'Autologous transplantation', 'Bone marrow transplantation', 'Stem cell transplantation']",2013/06/19 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(13)00106-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Aug;13(4):485-92. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2013.02.023.

Because of adverse outcomes in adult patients, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2011 about the use of NPWT in infants and children. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved, single-institution, retrospective review of pediatric patients who had undergone NPWT from 2007-2011. We collected the types of wounds for which NPWT was initiated, the NPWT outcomes, and the complications encountered. RESULTS: The data from 290 consecutive patients were reviewed. Their average age was 9.3 y (range 12 d to 18 y), and their average weight was 46.5 kg (range 1.1-177). Of the wounds, 66% were classified as acute, 10% as chronic, and 24% as traumatic. The two most common indications were surgical wound dehiscence (n = 47) and skin grafting (n = 41). NPWT was used in 15 wounds containing surgical hardware, with 2 devices requiring eventual removal. NPWT was used for a median of 9 d per patient (two dressing changes). Complications occurred in 5 patients (1.7%). Documentation problems were noted in 44 patients. After NPWT, about one-third of the patients (n = 95 patients) were able to undergo delayed primary closure. CONCLUSIONS: NPWT is an effective adjunct in wound healing and closure in the pediatric population, with no mortality ascribed to NPWT. Also, the complication rates were low.","['Rentea, Rebecca M', 'Somers, Kimberly K', 'Cassidy, Laura', 'Enters, Jessica', 'Arca, Marjorie J']","['Rentea RM', 'Somers KK', 'Cassidy L', 'Enters J', 'Arca MJ']","['Department of Surgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130604,United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,,IM,"['Abdominal Wound Closure Techniques', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology/surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Enteral Nutrition', 'Female', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa/epidemiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy/*methods', 'Osteosarcoma/epidemiology/surgery', 'Parenteral Nutrition', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Transplantation/*methods', 'Surgical Wound Dehiscence/diet therapy/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Surgical Wound Infection/diet therapy/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Wound Healing', 'Wounds and Injuries/diet therapy/epidemiology/*therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Abdominal wounds', 'Infants', 'Negative pressure wound therapy', 'Neonatal', 'Surgery', 'Wound healing']",2013/06/19 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-4804(13)00504-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jss.2013.05.056 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 2013 Sep;184(1):658-64. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2013.05.056.

The three major routes of HTLV-1 transmission are mother-to-child infections via breast milk, sexual intercourse, and blood transfusions. A HTLV-1 infection early in life, presumably from breast feeding, is crucial to the development of ATL. The estimated cumulative risk of developing ATL among HTLV-1-positive individuals is about 3% after transmission from the mother. The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subtype-classification into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types defined by organ involvement, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium values. For the acute, lymphoma and unfavorable chronic subtypes (aggressive ATL), and the favorable chronic and smoldering subtypes (indolent ATL), intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and watchful waiting until disease progression has been recommended, respectively, in Japan. A retrospective analysis suggested that the combination of interferon alpha and zidovudine was promising for the treatment of ATL, especially for leukemic subtypes. There are several new trials for ATL, including a defucosylated humanized anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody, histone deacetylase inhibitors, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor, a proteasome inhibitor and lenalidomide.","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Tobinai, Kensei']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Tobinai K']","['Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, 6-5-1 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan. ktsukasa@east.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130523,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In investigating the mechanisms mediating HIV-1 latency, we determined that silenced but transcriptionally competent HIV-1 proviruses reside in close proximity to PML NBs and that this association inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. PML binds to the latent HIV-1 promoter, which coincides with transcriptionally inactive facultative heterochromatic marks, notably H3K9me2, at the viral genome. PML degradation and NB disruption result in strong activation of viral transcription as well as release of G9a, the major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and loss of facultative heterochromatin marks from the proviral DNA. Additionally, HIV-1 transcriptional activation requires proviral displacement from PML NBs by active nuclear actin polymerization. Thus, nuclear topology and active gene movement mediate HIV-1 transcriptional regulation and have implications for controlling HIV-1 latency and eradication.","['Lusic, Marina', 'Marini, Bruna', 'Ali, Hashim', 'Lucic, Bojana', 'Luzzati, Roberto', 'Giacca, Mauro']","['Lusic M', 'Marini B', 'Ali H', 'Lucic B', 'Luzzati R', 'Giacca M']","['Molecular Medicine Laboratory, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ICGEB, 34149 Trieste, Italy. lusic@icgeb.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Host Microbe,Cell host & microbe,101302316,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proviruses/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Latency']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1931-3128(13)00188-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chom.2013.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Host Microbe. 2013 Jun 12;13(6):665-77. doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2013.05.006.,,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential protective effects of a physiologically relevant concentration (2 muM) of beta-carotene on the DNA damaging effects of catechol in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. Two different exposure protocols were used: simultaneous exposure to beta-carotene and catechol for 3 h; and exposure to catechol for 3 h after 18 h pre-treatment with the vitamin. DNA damage was evaluated using the comet assay (employing one procedure for general damage, and another procedure, which also included oxidative DNA damage). Independent of exposure protocol and procedure for comet assay, beta-carotene did not increase the basal level of DNA damage. However, at the highest concentration of catechol (1 mM), beta-carotene was found to clearly increase the level of catechol-induced DNA damage, especially in the pre-treated cells. Interestingly, an opposite effect was observed at lower concentrations of catechol, but the beta-carotene related reduction of catechol-induced genotoxicity was significant (P < 0.05) only for the procedure including oxidative damage induced by 0.5 mM catechol. Taken together our results indicate that beta- carotene can both reduce and enhance the DNA damaging effects of a genotoxic agent such as catechol. This indicates that it is the level of catechol-induced DNA damage that seems to determine whether beta-carotene should be regarded as a beneficial or detrimental agent when it comes to its use as a dietary supplement.","['Asgard, R', 'Hellman, B']","['Asgard R', 'Hellman B']","['Division of Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130710,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Catechols)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Oxidative Stress', 'beta Carotene/*pharmacology']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10715762.2013.815346 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2013 Sep;47(9):692-8. doi: 10.3109/10715762.2013.815346.

An optimized system was developed for efficient retroviral gene delivery into solid 143B osteosarcoma tumors in mice using a retargeted Env. In these studies, the viral Env CP was isolated from an in vitro screen of a library of feline leukemia virus Env randomized in the receptor-binding domain and maintained high titer on human 143B osteosarcoma cell line. FINDINGS: The vector developed to express the random Env libraries encoded the drug selectable marker neo. To adapt this for studies in live animals, the murine based vector was modified to express the luciferase gene. The bicistronic vector developed expressed both the CP Env and luciferase in the presence of either the MPMV CTE or a WPRE element. Virus bearing the CP FeLV Env variant maintained high titers after concentration allowing for direct visualization of delivery of the luciferase gene in subcutaneous 143B osteosarcoma tumors. CONCLUSION: This system serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of novel FeLV Env pseudotyped MLV particles for in vivo gene delivery. Gene delivery and expression of lucerifase from viral particles bearing the CP Env was readily detected in live mice after a single round of intratumor injection.","['Zhang, Xia', 'Sarangi, Anindita', 'Wu, Dai-Tze', 'Kanduri, Jaya', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Zhang X', 'Sarangi A', 'Wu DT', 'Kanduri J', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130614,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,['EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Mice', 'Osteosarcoma/*therapy', 'Staining and Labeling']",PMC3689073,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-194 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-194 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Jun 14;10:194. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-194.,"['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '3R01CA049932-16A1S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA49932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cancer cells can be addicted to high RNA synthesis, including synthesis of survival molecules. We hypothesised that dormant cancer cells, already low in RNA, might be sensitive to apoptosis induced by RNA Polymerase II (RP2) inhibitors that further reduce RNA synthesis. METHODS: We cultured leukaemia cells continuously in vitro in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor to model dormancy. Apoptosis, damage, RNA content and reducing capacity were evaluated. We treated dormancy-enriched cells for 48 hours with the nucleoside analogues ara-C, 5-azacytidine and clofarabine, the topoisomerase targeting agents daunorubicin, etoposide and irinotecan and three multikinase inhibitors with activity against RP2 - flavopiridol, roscovitine and TG02, and we measured growth inhibition and apoptosis. We describe use of the parameter 2 x IC50 to measure residual cell targeting. RNA synthesis was measured with 5-ethynyl uridine. Drug-induced apoptosis was measured flow cytometrically in primary cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia using a CD34/CD71/annexinV gating strategy to identify dormant apoptotic cells. RESULTS: Culture of the KG1a cell line continuously in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor induced features of dormancy including low RNA content, low metabolism and low basal ROS formation in the absence of a DNA damage response or apoptosis. All agents were more effective against the unmanipulated than the dormancy-enriched cells, emphasising the chemoresistant nature of dormant cells. However, the percentage of cell reduction by RP2 inhibitors at 2 x IC50 was significantly greater than that of other agents. RP2 inhibitors strongly inhibited RNA synthesis compared with other drugs. We also showed that RP2 inhibitors induce apoptosis in proliferating and dormancy-enriched KG1a cells and in the CD71neg CD34pos subset of primary acute myeloid leukaemia cells. CONCLUSION: We suggest that RP2 inhibitors may be a useful class of agent for targeting dormant leukaemia cells.","['Pallis, Monica', 'Burrows, Francis', 'Whittall, Abigail', 'Boddy, Nicholas', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Pallis M', 'Burrows F', 'Whittall A', 'Boddy N', 'Seedhouse C', 'Russell N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130615,England,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,BMC pharmacology & toxicology,101590449,"['0', '(14-methyl-20-oxa-5,7,14,26-tetraazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1(8,12))heptacosa-1(', '25),2(26),3,5,8(27),9,11,16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Roscovitine', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3685571,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['2050-6511-14-32 [pii]', '10.1186/2050-6511-14-32 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol. 2013 Jun 15;14:32. doi: 10.1186/2050-6511-14-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the hit-to-lead development of selective Bcl-XL inhibitors originating from a high-throughput screening campaign. Small structural changes to the hit compound increased binding affinity more than 300-fold (to IC50 < 20 nM). This molecular series exhibits drug-like characteristics, low molecular weights (Mw < 450), and unprecedented selectivity for Bcl-XL. Surface plasmon resonance experiments afford strong evidence of binding affinity within the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-XL. Biological experiments using engineered Mcl-1 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, reliant only on Bcl-XL for survival) and Bax/Bak deficient MEFs (insensitive to selective activation of Bcl-2-driven apoptosis) support a mechanism-based induction of apoptosis. This manuscript describes the first series of selective small-molecule inhibitors of Bcl-XL and provides promising leads for the development of efficacious therapeutics against solid tumors and chemoresistant cancer cell lines.","['Sleebs, Brad E', 'Kersten, Wilhemus J A', 'Kulasegaram, Sanji', 'Nikolakopoulos, George', 'Hatzis, Effie', 'Moss, Rebecca M', 'Parisot, John P', 'Yang, Hong', 'Czabotar, Peter E', 'Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Lee, Erinna F', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Chen, Lin', 'van Delft, Mark F', 'Lowes, Kym N', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Huang, David C S', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Street, Ian P', 'Baell, Jonathan B', 'Watson, Keith', 'Lessene, Guillaume']","['Sleebs BE', 'Kersten WJ', 'Kulasegaram S', 'Nikolakopoulos G', 'Hatzis E', 'Moss RM', 'Parisot JP', 'Yang H', 'Czabotar PE', 'Fairlie WD', 'Lee EF', 'Adams JM', 'Chen L', 'van Delft MF', 'Lowes KN', 'Wei A', 'Huang DC', 'Colman PM', 'Street IP', 'Baell JB', 'Watson K', 'Lessene G']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , 1G Royal Parade, Parkville VIC-3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130626,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'G5BW2593EP (benzothiazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Discovery', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hydrazones/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/deficiency/genetics', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/deficiency/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/deficiency/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",,,,2013/06/19 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm400556w [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2013 Jul 11;56(13):5514-40. doi: 10.1021/jm400556w.

Exposure to low concentrations of carrageenan (10 mu g/mL in the water supply) has produced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling in C57BL/6 mice. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) is a mediator of inflammatory signals from Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in myeloid and epithelial cells. Since the TLR4 signaling pathway is activated in diabetes and by carrageenan, we addressed systemic and intestinal inflammatory responses following carrageenan exposure in Bcl10 wild type, heterozygous, and null mice. Fecal calprotectin and circulating keratinocyte chemokine (KC), nuclear RelA and RelB, phospho(Thr559)-NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), and phospho(Ser36)-IkappaBalpha in the colonic epithelial cells were significantly less (P < 0.001) in the carrageenan-treated Bcl10 null mice than in controls. IL-10-deficient mice exposed to carrageenan in a germ-free environment showed an increase in activation of the canonical pathway of NF-kappaB (RelA) activation, but without increase in RelB or phospho-Bcl10, and exogenous IL-10 inhibited only the canonical pathway of NF- kappa B activation in cultured colonic cells. These findings demonstrate a Bcl10 requirement for maximum development of carrageenan-induced inflammation and lack of complete suppression by IL-10 of carrageenan-induced inflammation.","['Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Xue, Liquan', 'Devkota, Suzanne', 'Chang, Eugene', 'Morris, Stephan', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Xue L', 'Devkota S', 'Chang E', 'Morris S', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 840 S Wood Street, CSN 440 M/C 718, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130526,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Carrageenan/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/blood', 'Colon/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inflammation/*chemically induced/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Interleukin-8/blood', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'NF-kappa B/blood', 'Phosphorylation']",PMC3677668,,,2013/06/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/397642 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2013;2013:397642. doi: 10.1155/2013/397642.

From the Copenhagen Primary Care Differential Count (CopDiff) Database, we identified 356,196 individuals with at least one differential cell count (DIFF) encompassing the eosinophil count during 2000-2007. From these, one DIFF was randomly chosen and categorized according to no (<0.5 x 10(9) /L), mild (>/= 0.5-1.0 x 10(9) /L) or severe (>/= 1.0 x 10(9) /L) eosinophilia. From the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System, we ascertained hematological malignancies and death within 3 years following the DIFF. Using multivariable logistic regression odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and adjusted for previous eosinophilia in a DIFF, sex, age, year, month, C-reactive protein, previous cancer, and comorbidity. ORs for developing Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) was significantly increased in individuals exhibiting severe eosinophilia, OR = 9.09 (C.I. 2.77-29.84), P = 0.0003. The association with classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (cMPNs) showed an increasing risk with OR = 1.65 (1.04-2.61) P = 0.0322 and OR = 3.87 (1.67-8.96) P = 0.0016 for mild and severe eosinophilia. Eosinophilia was in a similar fashion associated with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), OR = 2.57 (1.50-4.43), P = 0.0006 and OR = 5.00 (1.57-15.94), P = 0.0065, and all-cause death, OR of 1.16 (1.09-1.24), P < 0.0001 and 1.60 (1.35-1.91), P < 0.0001. We confirm associations between eosinophilia and HL and cMPNs, and in addition for the first time demonstrate a dose-dependent association between eosinophilia and CLL as well as death. Unexplained eosinophilia should prompt clinicians to consider conditions where early diagnosis may improve prognosis.","['Andersen, Christen Lykkegaard', 'Siersma, Volkert Dirk', 'Hasselbalch, Hans Carl', 'Lindegaard, Hanne', 'Vestergaard, Hanne', 'Felding, Peter', 'de Fine Olivarius, Niels', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis']","['Andersen CL', 'Siersma VD', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Lindegaard H', 'Vestergaard H', 'Felding P', 'de Fine Olivarius N', 'Bjerrum OW']","['Department of Hematology, Roskilde University Hospital, Denmark; The Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130801,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Eosinophilia/blood/complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2013/06/15 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23515 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Oct;88(10):843-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23515.

Previous studies show that expression of intact MAT1 protein is associated with expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), whereas intrinsically programmed or retinoic acid (RA)-induced MAT1 fragmentation accompanies granulocytic differentiation of HSC or leukemic myeloblasts. Here we determined that, in humanized mouse microenvironment, MAT1 overexpression resisted intrinsic MAT1 fragmentation to sustain hematopoietic CD34+ cell expansion while preventing granulopoiesis. Conversely, we mimicked MAT1 fragmentation in vitro and in a mouse model by overexpressing a fragmented 81-aa MAT1 polypeptide (pM9) that retains the domain for assembling CAK but cannot affix CAK to TFIIH-core. Our results showed that pM9 formed DeltaCAK by competing with MAT1 for CAK assembly to mimic MAT1 fragmentation-depletion of CAK. This resulting DeltaCAK acted as a dominant negative to inhibit the growth and metastasis of different leukemic myeloblasts, with or without RA resistance, by concurrently suppressing CAK and TFIIH kinase activities to inhibit cell cycle and gene transcription. These findings suggest that the intrinsically programmed MAT1 expression and fragmentation regulate granulopoiesis by inversely coordinating CAK and TFIIH activities, whereas pM9 shares a mechanistic resemblance with MAT1 fragmentation in suppressing myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Lou, Siyue', 'Liu, Gang', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki', 'Yang, Xiaochun', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Wu, Lingtao']","['Lou S', 'Liu G', 'Shimada H', 'Yang X', 'He Q', 'Wu L']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, The Saban Research Institute, Los Angeles, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MNAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (carboxy-terminal domain kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3795903,['NOTNLM'],"['C-terminal fragmentation of MAT1', 'CAK-coordinated cell cycle and transcription', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'Retinoid signaling', 'Transcription factor IIH kinase']",2013/06/15 06:00,2014/05/08 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1444 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2013 Sep;31(9):1942-53. doi: 10.1002/stem.1444.,"['R01 CA120512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA111440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA120512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) AlphaMed Press.'],,['NIHMS502962'],,,,,,,,

This compound inhibited proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, induced apoptosis and blocked cell cycle progression at G2 -M phase. This was associated with the accumulation of cyclin B1, Bub1 and p21(Cip1/Waf-1), changes in the phosphorylation status of cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdc25C and MPM-2, and inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Moreover, cell death was found to be associated with cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspases and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and completely abrogated by the free-radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine.

This dual function of IMiDs makes them appealing candidates for combination with a cancer vaccine. We investigated the immune stimulatory effects of lenalidomide, administrated to mice in doses, which provided comparable pharmacokinetics to human patients, on the potency of a novel fusion DNA lymphoma vaccine. The combination was curative in the majority of mice with 8d pre-established syngeneic A20 lymphomas compared with vaccine or lenalidomide alone and induced immune memory. In vivo depletion experiments established the requirement for effector CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in protective immunity. Unexpectedly, lenalidomide alone was also associated with reduced numbers of systemic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and regulatory T cell (Treg) in tumor-bearing but not naive mice, an effect that was independent of simple tumor burden reduction. These results confirm and extend results from other models describing the effect of lenalidomide on enhancing T-cell immunity, highlight the potency of this effect, and provide a rationale for clinical application. Independently, a novel mechanism of action reversing tumor-induced immune suppression by MDSC is suggested.","['Sakamaki, I', 'Kwak, L W', 'Cha, S-c', 'Yi, Q', 'Lerman, B', 'Chen, J', 'Surapaneni, S', 'Bateman, S', 'Qin, H']","['Sakamaki I', 'Kwak LW', 'Cha SC', 'Yi Q', 'Lerman B', 'Chen J', 'Surapaneni S', 'Bateman S', 'Qin H']","['1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', '1] Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA [2] Center for Cancer Immunology Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130614,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Lenalidomide', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/immunology']",PMC4581849,,,2013/06/15 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013177 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.177 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Feb;28(2):329-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.177.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes encode key innate immunity signal initiators. We recently identified multiple genes, known to be regulated by TLRs, to be overexpressed in MDS bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells, and hypothesized that TLR signaling is abnormally activated in MDS. We analyzed a large cohort of MDS cases and identified TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 to be significantly overexpressed in MDS BM CD34+ cells. Deep sequencing followed by Sanger resequencing of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 genes uncovered a recurrent genetic variant, TLR2-F217S, in 11% of 149 patients. Functionally, TLR2-F217S results in enhanced activation of downstream signaling including NF-kappaB activity after TLR2 agonist treatment. In cultured primary BM CD34+ cells of normal donors, TLR2 agonists induced histone demethylase JMJD3 and interleukin-8 gene expression. Inhibition of TLR2 in BM CD34+ cells from patients with lower-risk MDS using short hairpin RNA resulted in increased erythroid colony formation. Finally, RNA expression levels of TLR2 and TLR6, as well as presence of TLR2-F217S, are associated with distinct prognosis and clinical characteristics. These findings indicate that TLR2-centered signaling is deregulated in MDS, and that its targeting may have potential therapeutic benefit in MDS.","['Wei, Y', 'Dimicoli, S', 'Bueso-Ramos, C', 'Chen, R', 'Yang, H', 'Neuberg, D', 'Pierce, S', 'Jia, Y', 'Zheng, H', 'Wang, H', 'Wang, X', 'Nguyen, M', 'Wang, S A', 'Ebert, B', 'Bejar, R', 'Levine, R', 'Abdel-Wahab, O', 'Kleppe, M', 'Ganan-Gomez, I', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Garcia-Manero, G']","['Wei Y', 'Dimicoli S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Chen R', 'Yang H', 'Neuberg D', 'Pierce S', 'Jia Y', 'Zheng H', 'Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Nguyen M', 'Wang SA', 'Ebert B', 'Bejar R', 'Levine R', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Kleppe M', 'Ganan-Gomez I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130614,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 6)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6B protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4011663,,,2013/06/15 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013180 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.180 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Sep;27(9):1832-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.180.
