We have investigated the oxygen consumption rates and oxygen concentration in wild-type (WT) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depleted (rho(0)) Molt-4 cells. Wild-type Molt-4 cells have moderate oxygen consumption rates, which were significantly reduced in the rho(0) cells. PCMB (p-chloromercurobenzoate) inhibited the oxygen consumption rates in both WT and rho(0) cells, whereas potassium cyanide decreased the oxygen consumption rates only in WT Molt-4 cells. Menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) increased the oxygen consumption rates in both cell lines, whereas CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) stimulated the oxygen consumption rates only in WT Molt-4 cells. Superoxide radical adducts were observed in both WT and rho(0) cells when stimulated with MSB. The formation of this adduct was inhibited by PCMB but not by potassium cyanide. These results suggest that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by MSB were at least in part produced via a mitochondrial independent pathway. An oxygen gradient between the extra- and intracellular compartments was observed in WT Molt-4 cells, which further increased when cells were stimulated by CCCP and MSB. The results are consistent with our earlier findings suggesting that such oxygen gradients may be a general phenomenon found in most or all cell systems under appropriate conditions.","['Shen, Jiangang', 'Khan, Nadeem', 'Lewis, Lionel D', 'Armand, Ray', 'Grinberg, Oleg', 'Demidenko, Eugene', 'Swartz, Harold']","['Shen J', 'Khan N', 'Lewis LD', 'Armand R', 'Grinberg O', 'Demidenko E', 'Swartz H']","['EPR Center, Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['P41 RR011602/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 231098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 RR11602/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM34250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Methyl 2-((succinimidooxy)carbonyl)benzoate)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Succinimides)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '59-85-8 (p-Chloromercuribenzoic Acid)', 'MQD255M2ZO (Potassium Cyanide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects/*physiology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Oximetry/*methods', 'Oxygen/analysis/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Potassium Cyanide/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Spin Trapping', 'Succinimides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'p-Chloromercuribenzoic Acid/pharmacology']",PMC1302705,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(03)74944-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74944-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2003 Feb;84(2 Pt 1):1291-8. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74944-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that heterologously expressed TRPM7 channels are activated (Runnels et al., 2001) or inhibited (Nadler et al., 2001) by dialyzing the cell with millimolar levels of ATP. The endogenous correlate of TRPM7 has been identified in T-lymphocytes and RBL (rat basophilic leukemia) cells and named MagNuM (for Mg(2+)-nucleotide-inhibited metal) or MIC (for Mg(2+)-inhibited cation). Here, we report that internal Mg(2+) rather than MgATP inhibits this current. Cytoplasmic MgATP, supplied by dialysis at millimolar concentrations, effectively inhibits only when a weak Mg(2+) chelator is present in the pipette solution. Thus, MgATP acts as a source of Mg(2+) rather than a source of ATP. Using an externally accessible site within the pore of the MIC channel itself as a bioassay, we show that equimolar MgCl(2) and MgATP solutions contain similar amounts of free Mg(2+), explaining the fact that numeric values of Mg(2+) and MgATP concentrations necessary for complete inhibition are the same. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mg(2+) is not unique in its inhibitory action, as Ba(2+), Sr(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+) can substitute for Mg(2+), causing complete inhibition. We conclude that MIC current inhibition occurs simply by divalent cations.","['Kozak, J Ashot', 'Cahalan, Michael D']","['Kozak JA', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS014609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 NS014609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '02F3473H9O (Magnesium Chloride)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Trpm7 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cations/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Ion Channel Gating/*drug effects', 'Ion Channels/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Magnesium Chloride/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Protein Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'TRPM Cation Channels', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",PMC1302670,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(03)74909-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74909-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2003 Feb;84(2 Pt 1):922-7. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74909-1.,['Biophys J. 2004 Oct;87(4):2912'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An application on three newly synthesised anti-tumour steroidal esters.,79-86,"Three newly synthesised steroidal esteric derivatives of nitrogen mustard (compounds 1-3) were comparatively studied on a molar basis regarding their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in normal human lymphocytes in vitro and therapeutic effects on leukemia P388 bearing mice. Compounds 1 and 3 are modified steroidal esters of p-methyl-m-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)amino benzoic acid, and compound 2 is a modified steroidal ester of chlorambucil. All compounds induced statistically significant increases in SCEs and decreases in proliferation rate indices (PRIs) of cultured human lymphocytes and significantly increased the life span of P388 bearing mice. In this study, the doses applied for therapeutic purposes upon leukemia P388 bearing mice in vivo were derived from cytogenetic observations in normal human lymphocytes in vitro. A substantially better therapeutic effect was obtained compared to the effect achieved after the use of quite higher doses related with LD(10) values. We have demonstrated that the order of anti-tumour effectiveness of the treatment schedules of the three newly synthesised compounds tested (at doses derived from cytogenetic observations) coincides with the order of the cytogenetic effects they induce. The SCE assay appears to have an application in the clinical prediction of tumour sensitivity to potential chemotherapeutics.","['Karayianni, Venetia', 'Mioglou, Eleftheria', 'Iakovidou, Zafiroula', 'Mourelatos, Dionysios', 'Fousteris, Manolis', 'Koutsourea, Anna', 'Arsenou, Evaggelia', 'Nikolaropoulos, Sotiris']","['Karayianni V', 'Mioglou E', 'Iakovidou Z', 'Mourelatos D', 'Fousteris M', 'Koutsourea A', 'Arsenou E', 'Nikolaropoulos S']","['Laboratory of Biology and Genetics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects', 'Steroids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571802002863 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00286-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2003 Feb 5;535(1):79-86. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00286-3.,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It targets topoisomerase II enhancing the formation of a cleavable DNA-enzyme complex and leading to DNA fragmentation in dividing cancer cells. Little is known about other modes of the interaction of amsacrine with DNA, by which it could affect also normal cells. Using the alkaline comet assay, we showed that amsacrine at concentrations from the range 0.01 to 10 microM induced DNA damage in normal human lymphocytes, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells lacking the p53 gene and murine pro-B lymphoid cells BaF3 expressing BCR/ABL oncogene measured as the increase in percentage tail DNA. The effect was dose-dependent. Treated cells were able to recover within a 120-min incubation. Amifostine at 14 mM decreased the level of DNA damage in normal lymphocytes, had no effect on the HL-60 cells and potentiated the DNA-damaging effect of the drug in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. Vitamin C at 10 and 50 microM diminished the extent of DNA damage in normal lymphocytes, but had no effect in cancer cells. Pre-treatment of the cells with the nitrone spin trap, N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone or ebselen, which mimics glutathione peroxidase, reduced the extent of DNA damage evoked by amsacrine in all types of cells. The cells exposed to amsacrine and treated with endonuclease III and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II, the enzymes recognizing oxidized and alkylated bases, respectively, displayed greater extent of DNA damage than those not treated with these enzymes. The results obtained suggest that free radicals may be involved in the formation of DNA lesions induced by amsacrine. The drug can also methylate DNA bases. Our results indicate that the induction of secondary malignancies should be taken into account as diverse side effects of amsacrine. Amifostine may potentate DNA-damage effect of amsacrine in cancer cells and decrease this effect in normal cells and Vitamin C can be considered as a protective agent against DNA damage in normal cells.","['Blasiak, Janusz', 'Gloc, Ewa', 'Drzewoski, Jozef', 'Wozniak, Katarzyna', 'Zadrozny, Marek', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Pertynski, Tomasz']","['Blasiak J', 'Gloc E', 'Drzewoski J', 'Wozniak K', 'Zadrozny M', 'Skorski T', 'Pertynski T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. junuszb@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Azoles)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '3I91332OPG (phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone)', '40X2P7DPGH (ebselen)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amifostine/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Azoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Comet Assay', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoindoles', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Nitrogen Oxides/pharmacology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571802002899 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00289-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2003 Feb 5;535(1):25-34. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00289-9.,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a novel deletion of chromosome 1, del(1)(p34p36) in a case of AML, French-American-British classification M1, in a previously healthy 33-year-old male. This isolated cytogenetic abnormality occurred in 33% of the myeloblasts examined at diagnosis. Subsequent cytogenetic analyses conducted on marrow following induction and consolidation therapy demonstrated a normal male karyotype in all cells examined. The patient remains in clinical and hematological remission 22 months following diagnosis. The presence of 1p abnormalities in AML and other malignancies is reviewed, as are candidate tumor suppressor genes in the 1p34 approximately p36 region.

METHODS: Two alkyl 9-nitrocamptothecin (9NC) esters 5g and 5h were prepared by esterification reactions of 9NC with valeric anhydride and heptanoic anhydride, respectively. Eight 9NC esters 5a-5h were tested for cytotoxicity against human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U-937. Flow cytometry analysis was used to identify the cell cycle phase targeted by the esters and quantify the extent of ester-induced cell death (apoptosis). RESULTS: Esters 5b and 5c demonstrated great abilities to inhibit growth of the leukemia cells followed by induction of apoptosis; esters 5a, 5e, and 5g induced slight perturbations in the cell cycle at high concentrations; and esters 5d, 5f, and 5h were completely inactive against the cell lines tested. Thus these esters showed the cell anti-proliferative activity in an order of 5b approximately 5c>5a approximately 5e approximately 5g>5d approximately 5f approximately 5h. Esters 5b, 5c, and 5e were tested in vivo against various human carcinomas in nude mice grown as xenografts. Only 5b and 5c showed a significant antitumor activity. Particularly, ester 5b demonstrated an antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of human carcinomas including breast, lung, colon, pancreas, stomach, ovarian, and melanoma, etc. CONCLUSION: These esters act like prodrugs of their parental 9-nitrocamptothecin. High drug doses need to be administered to animals in order to inhibit growth, and induce regression, of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. These compounds may be developed into potent anticancer drugs due to their low toxicity.","['Cao, Zhi-Song', 'Pantazis, Panayotis', 'Mendoza, John', 'Early, Janet', 'Kozielski, Anthony', 'Harris, Nick', 'Giovanella, Beppino']","['Cao ZS', 'Pantazis P', 'Mendoza J', 'Early J', 'Kozielski A', 'Harris N', 'Giovanella B']","['The Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research at St. Joseph Hospital, 1918 Chenevert, Houston, Texas 77003, USA. zcao@stehlin.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'H19C446XXB (rubitecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Esters', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Prodrugs/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2003 Feb;24(2):109-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AFX (acute-lymphocytic-leukaemia-1 fused gene from chromosome X), FKHR (Forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) and FKHR-L1 (FKHR-like 1) transcription factors are directly phosphorylated by protein kinase B, resulting in nuclear export and inhibition of transcription. This signalling pathway was first identified in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, where it has a role in regulation of the life span of the organism. Studies have shown that this evolutionarily conserved signalling module has a role in regulation of both cell-cycle progression and cell survival in higher eukaryotes. These effects are co-ordinated by FOXO-mediated induction of a variety of specific target genes that are only now beginning to be identified. Interestingly, FOXO transcription factors appear to be able to regulate transcription through both DNA-binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our understanding of the regulation of FOXO activity, and defining specific transcriptional targets, may provide clues to the molecular mechanisms controlling cell fate decisions to divide, differentiate or die.","['Birkenkamp, K U', 'Coffer, P J']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Coffer PJ']","['Department of Pulmonary Diseases, University Medical Center, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bst0310292 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2003 Feb;31(Pt 1):292-7. doi: 10.1042/bst0310292.,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through May 2001, 367 patients, including 163 active duty service members, have received allogeneic HSCT from related donors. We performed a retrospective review of the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in active duty members to determine what proportion was returned to full-time military service after HSCT and to delineate the factors associated with successful return to military service. Twenty-one percent of service members who received allogeneic HSCT were returned to active duty at some point after treatment. Age, sex, branch of service, and rank had no significant influence on return to duty status. When adjusted for age and rank, the only significant predictor of successful return to active duty was a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although individuals with good risk diseases such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, paroxymal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and acute myelogenous leukemia in first complete remission have also been returned active duty after HSCT, these diagnoses were not statistically predictive of a return to active duty. We conclude that it may be possible to predict which service members will return to active duty after allogeneic HSCT based on the disease for which HSCT is being performed. Most importantly, active duty service members need not be a priori medically retired after HSCT, and each return to duty decision must be individualized.","['Ornstein, Deborah L', 'Frye, Brenda L', 'Ririe, David', 'Shaughnessy, Paul', 'Burke, Cynthia T', 'Coronado, Irene', 'Bush, Anneke C']","['Ornstein DL', 'Frye BL', 'Ririe D', 'Shaughnessy P', 'Burke CT', 'Coronado I', 'Bush AC']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Center, Hematology/Oncology Flight, 59 MDW/MMIH Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX 78236, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Military Medicine', 'Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mil Med. 2003 Jan;168(1):28-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the large body of thermal neutron activation measurements carried out over many years in Hiroshima and Nagasaki appear to indicate that current DS86 neutron doses may have been significantly underestimated in Hiroshima. An earlier companion paper has provided an update of neutron activation measurements. While a large body of data appears to support a significant increase, there is ongoing debate and review regarding its validity. However, as yet, there are no detailed, peer-reviewed, published refutations of the neutron activation data which appear to support an increase in neutron doses. In this paper, we consider the impact of possible future revisions in the DS86 dosimetry on radiation risk estimates. We consider the extreme range of possibilities from maintaining the existing DS86 values, to changes in neutron doses in accord with the majority of existing neutron activation data. We have used the latest cancer incidence data and cancer mortality data for the A-bomb survivors, and neutron doses have been modified using a neutron revision factor (NRF) in line with the latest thermal neutron activation measurements in Hiroshima. In contrast to previous analyses, a nonlinear relationship between log(NRF) and slant range has been used which better represents the data beyond slant ranges of approximately 1 km. The impact on the evaluation of neutron relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and gamma radiation risk estimates has been assessed. While DS86 neutron doses are too low to allow any useful direct evaluation of neutron risk or neutron RBE, it becomes possible to derive more meaningful values if neutron doses are increased in Hiroshima in line with the broad range of thermal neutron activation measurements. The uncertainties are smallest for the cancer incidence data. The best estimates of neutron RBE give upper 95% confidence limits of about 6 for all solid tumours for the incidence data and about 28 for the mortality data. The uncertainties in neutron RBE for leukaemia incidence are larger, and estimation at doses below about 0.1 Gy is not possible. There is no significant change in the excess relative risk for gamma radiation for all solid tumours taken together, compared with the current DS86 dosimetry. The results preclude neutron RBE values significantly greater than the current ICRP radiation weighting factors, which range between 5 and 20, depending on energy. Whether or not the Japanese bomb survivors can indeed form the basis for useful, directly determined neutron risks clearly depends on the veracity of existing neutron activation data. This is currently the subject of careful international scrutiny and the outcome is eagerly awaited.","['Hunter, Nezahat', 'Charles, Monty W']","['Hunter N', 'Charles MW']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK. nezahat.hunter@nrpb.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Animals', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', '*Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiometry', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",,2003/01/28 04:00,2003/04/11 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/22/4/302 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2002 Dec;22(4):357-70. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/22/4/302.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza2dc) increased the sensitivity of the K562 leukaemic cell line to UV light-induced apoptosis in association with increased Apaf-1 protein levels. There was no correlation between Apaf-1 protein expression and Apaf-1 mRNA levels after the demethylation treatment. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to show that the methylation can occur within the Apaf-1 promoter region in leukaemic blasts. Apaf-1 DNA methylation was demonstrated in acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoid leukaemia, suggesting that it is not specific to a particular leukaemia subtype.

However, adverse events leading to discontinuation may occur in 10-20% of patients. The efficacy of AZA and 6-MP is based on formation of their active metabolites, the 6-thioguaninenucleotides (6-TGNs). Therefore, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), an agent leading more directly to the formation of 6-TGNs and until recently used only in patients suffering from leukaemia, may be an alternative in AZA or 6-MP intolerance. The purpose of our study was to assess the short-term safety of 6-TG. METHODS: Thirty-two IBD patients with previously established AZA or 6-MP intolerance were treated with 6-TG in doses of 20 mg (n = 19) or 40 mg (n = 13) once daily. Safety parameters were obtained at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after start of medication. Primary outcome measures were the ability to tolerate 6-TG and the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome definitions included laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Twenty-six (81%) patients were able to tolerate 6-TG during the first 8 weeks. In three of six patients, side effects leading to discontinuation were probably (n = 2) or obviously (n = 1) related to 6-TG. No clinically relevant haematological events or hepatotoxicity occurred in the observed period. Steady-state 6-TG levels were significantly higher with 40 mg once daily (1621 +/- 828 picomol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (RBC)) than with 20 mg once daily (937 +/- 325 picomol/8 x 10(8) RBC; n = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 6-TG treatment seems promising in AZA- or 6-MP-intolerant IBD patients.

Three different polymorphisms (A79C, G208A and T435C) were identified in the coding region of the HDCA gene and displayed allelic frequencies of 20.1%, 4.3% and 70.1%, respectively. No association with susceptibility to disease was observed. A novel polymorphism, G208A produced an alanine to threonine substitution (A70T) within the conserved catalytic domain. By introduction of the polymorphic HCDA genes into the yeast CDA-null mutants, the HCDA-70T showed 40% and 32% activity of prototype for cytidine and ara-C substrates, respectively (P < 0.01). The ara-C IC50 value of the yeast transformants carrying HCDA-70T was 757 +/- 33 micromol and was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that of prototype (941 +/- 58 micromol).

Here we report that SB203580 by itself could induce human promyeloid leukemic HL-60 cells to differentiate mainly along the granulocytic lineage, as evidenced by cellular morphological changes, and the concurrent expression of cell surface markers CD11b and CD14. This differentiation induction was time and dose dependent. After 12 h exposure to 10 microM SB203580, 12.5% of the cells became CD11b as compared to only 2.6% in untreated control cells. By 96 h, CD11b cells increased to 72.3%, and among them, 26% were CD14. Morphologically, the cells were smaller in size with lower nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. The nucleus was indented and nucleoli markedly reduced. However, 10 microM SB203580 had little effect on HL-60 cell growth and survival during the first 72 h, but by 96 h the percentage of cells in G1 phase was markedly increased. These effects of SB203580 were not attributable to its inhibition of p38 kinase activity. Instead, the essential kinases in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway such as phospho-Raf-1, phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p90RSK were all elevated dramatically shortly after cells were exposed to SB203580 and lasted for 24 h before declining. Pre-incubation of cells with 20 microM of PD98059 1 h before addition of SB203580 could completely block the expression of differentiation markers. Our results suggest that SB203580-induced differentiation in HL-60 cells was mediated by activation of MEK/ERK signaling. In conclusion, our data have shown that SB203580 possessed biological activities other than inhibition of p38 and these activities could make it a potential candidate as an inducing agent for cell differentiation in the therapeutic treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Jin-Xia', 'Zhuang, Wie-Jian', 'Poon, Ka-Hung', 'Yang, Michael', 'Fong, Wang-Fun']","['Zhang JX', 'Zhuang WJ', 'Poon KH', 'Yang M', 'Fong WF']","['Bioactive Products Research Group, Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/08/07 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200301000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2003 Jan;14(1):31-8. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200301000-00005.,,['Copyright 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, only studies in adults and preliminary data from a phase 1 study in children have been reported. We report data on 15 children with relapsed/refractory CD33(+) AML who were treated with GO monotherapy on compassionate use basis (4-9 mg/m(2) up to 3 courses). Eight children showed a reduction in bone marrow blasts to 5% or less, including 5 in complete remission without full platelet recovery (CRp). Three of the 5 children with CRp received transplants almost directly following the last GO course, without awaiting further platelet regeneration. Hence in these children no clear discrimination between complete remission (CR) and CRp could be made. In 6 of 8 responding patients further treatment was given consisting of stem cell transplantation (SCT). Two patients are still alive, currently 6 and 9 months after SCT. Hematologic toxicity was difficult to assess due to subsequent SCT or leukemia. Side effects, in one patient each included veno-occlusive disease, transient grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia, transient grade 3 transaminase elevation, and grade 3 hypotension during GO administration.

We observed mesangial deposition of Haemophilus parainfluenza outer membrane (OMHP) antigen and decreased glycosylation of the IgA1 hinge in the recipient's samples is consistent with the recently reported pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. Further, the titer of IgA antibody against the donor serum was as high as other IgA nephropathy cases. These findings suggest that NS and crescentic glomerulonephritis in this case occurred as one of the forms of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and that IgA deposition was associated with H parainfluenza and decreased glycosylation of the IgA1 hinge.","['Kimura, Shinya', 'Horie, Akeyo', 'Hiki, Yoshiyuki', 'Yamamoto, Chie', 'Suzuki, Satoru', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Deguchi, Masayo', 'Kato, Gen-ichi', 'Karasuno, Takahiro', 'Hiraoka, Akira', 'Yoshikawa, Toshikazu', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Kimura S', 'Horie A', 'Hiki Y', 'Yamamoto C', 'Suzuki S', 'Kuroda J', 'Deguchi M', 'Kato G', 'Karasuno T', 'Hiraoka A', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan. shkimu@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin A)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/*metabolism', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*etiology/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2290 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44479-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4219-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2290.

Intriguingly, HOXD13, a member of the HOXD cluster not normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, was recently identified as a partner of NUP98 in a t(2;11) translocation associated with t-AML/MDS. We have now tested directly the leukemogenic potential of the NUP98-HOXD13 t(2; 11) fusion gene in the murine hematopoietic model. NUP98-HOXD13 strongly promoted growth and impaired differentiation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro; this effect was dependent on the NUP98 portion and an intact HOXD13 homeodomain. Expression of the NUP98-HOXD13 fusion gene in vivo resulted in a partial impairment of lymphopoiesis but did not induce evident hematologic disease until late after transplantation (more than 5 months), when some mice developed a myeloproliferative-like disease. In contrast, mice transplanted with bone marrow (BM) cells cotransduced with NUP98-HOXD13 and the HOX cofactor Meis1 rapidly developed lethal and transplantable acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a median disease onset of 75 days. In summary, this study demonstrates that NUP98-HOXD13 can be directly implicated in the molecular process leading to leukemic transformation, and it supports a model in which the transforming properties of NUP98-HOXD13 are mediated through HOX-dependent pathways.","['Pineault, Nicolas', 'Buske, Christian', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Abramovich, Carolina', 'Rosten, Patty', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Pineault N', 'Buske C', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Abramovich C', 'Rosten P', 'Hogge DE', 'Aplan PD', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA13 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2484 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54084-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4529-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2484.

Here we identify functional elements in the FR-beta gene and examine the molecular mechanism of transcriptional induction of FR-beta by ATRA. The basal promoter activity of FR-beta resulted from synergistic interaction between Sp1 and ets binding sites (EBSs) and repression by upstream AP-1-like elements, whose action required EBSs. A minimal promoter containing the Sp1 and ets elements was ATRA-responsive. The repressor elements bound Fos family proteins; association of the proteins with the repressor elements correlated negatively with FR-beta expression in peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes and also in KG-1 (AML) cells grown in the absence or in the presence of ATRA. Furthermore, down-regulation of FR-beta in KG-1 cells treated with O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was accompanied by increased AP-1 binding to the repressor elements. From chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the nuclear retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) associated with the Sp1 region, and RARs beta and gamma associated with the AP-1 and Sp1 regions; treatment of KG-1 cells with ATRA did not alter Sp1 binding but increased the association of RARalpha and decreased the association of RARs beta and gamma. ATRA also decreased RAR expression levels. The results suggest that the FR-beta gene is a target for multiple coordinate actions of nuclear receptors for ATRA directly and indirectly acting on a transcriptional complex containing activating Sp1/ets and inhibitory AP-1 proteins. The multiple mechanisms favor the prediction that ATRA will induce FR-beta expression in a broad spectrum of AML cells. Further, optimal FR-beta induction may be expected when all 3 RAR subtypes bind agonist.","['Hao, Hong', 'Qi, Huiling', 'Ratnam, Manohar']","['Hao H', 'Qi H', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH 43614-5804, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA70873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Blood Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3174 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54087-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4551-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3174.

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of AKR1C3 reciprocally desensitizes HL-60 cells to ATRA and D3, thus confirming the enzyme as a novel regulator of cell differentiation. AKR1C3 possesses marked 11-ketoreductase activity converting prostaglandin (PG) D2 to PGF2alpha. Supplementing HL-60 cultures with PGD2 mimicked treatment with AKR1C3-inhibitors by enhancing the differentiation of the cells in response to ATRA. However, PGD2 is chemically unstable, being converted first to PGJ2 and then stepwise to 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2(15Delta-PGJ2), a natural ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). Consistent with this, PGD2 was rapidly converted to PGJ2 under normal tissue culture conditions but not in the presence of recombinant AKR1C3 when PGF2alpha was predominantly formed. In addition, PGJ2 but not PGF2alpha recapitulated the potentiation of HL-60 differentiation by PGD2 and AKR1C3 inhibitors. Furthermore, the capacity of all of these treatments to potentiate HL-60 cell differentiation was significantly reduced in the presence of the PPARgamma-antagonist GW 9662. We conclude that AKRIC3 protects HL-60 cells against ATRA and D3-induced cell differentiation by limiting the production of natural PPARgamma ligands via the diversion of PGD2 toward PGF2alpha and away from PGJ2. In addition, these observations identify AKR1C3 as plausible target for the non-cyclooxygenase-dependent antineoplastic actions of NSAIDs.","['Desmond, Julian C', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Walker, Elizabeth A', 'Hewison, Martin', 'Ride, Jonathan P', 'Luong, Quang T', 'Hayden, Rachel E', 'Vanin, Elio F', 'Bunce, Christopher M']","['Desmond JC', 'Mountford JC', 'Drayson MT', 'Walker EA', 'Hewison M', 'Ride JP', 'Luong QT', 'Hayden RE', 'Vanin EF', 'Bunce CM']","['Division of Medical Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TH United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '08J2K08A3Y (Dihydrotestosterone)', '25126-76-5 (Androstane-3,17-diol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.50 (3-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (B-Specific))', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '3-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (B-Specific)', 'Androstane-3,17-diol/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Anilides/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Dihydrotestosterone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transgenes', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/03/14 04:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Jan 15;63(2):505-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clone, named M17, contains a 1600bp nucleotide sequence that encodes a 215 amino acid putative protein that would have a pI of 9.01 and would include a 33 amino acid signal peptide. The 3' untranslated region has seven ATTTA mRNA destabilising motifs that are common in cytokines and oncogenes. In a BLASTP search, M17 was most similar to chicken ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with 25% amino acid identity, followed by mammalian CNTF, cardiotrophin-1 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) all of which belong to the IL-6 subfamily. However, M17 has some differences with CNTF in that CNTF has no signal sequence, the gene organisation of M17 is three exons and two introns, whereas that of CNTF is two exons and one intron, M17 has seven cysteines while CNTF has one cysteine, and M17 mRNA is detected in peripheral blood leukocytes as well as brain, whereas CNTF is expressed only in the nervous system. Compared to other members in the IL-6 subfamily cytokines, M17's cysteine positions and gene organisation are similar to those of oncostatin M and LIF, although amino acid identities are only 15-17%. Southern hybridisation suggested that M17 is a single copy gene. SA-PC showed significantly higher M17 mRNA levels than normal head kidney cells, which are considered to be a source of the SA-PC, indicating that M17 is inducible by inflammatory stimulation.","['Fujiki, Kazuhiro', 'Nakao, Miki', 'Dixon, Brian']","['Fujiki K', 'Nakao M', 'Dixon B']","['Department of Biology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, N2L 3G1, Waterloo, Ont., Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Comp Immunol,Developmental and comparative immunology,7708205,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carps/genetics/*immunology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/*chemistry', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*genetics/physiology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145305X02000745 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-305x(02)00074-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Comp Immunol. 2003 Feb;27(2):127-36. doi: 10.1016/s0145-305x(02)00074-5.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY102632', 'GENBANK/AY102633']",,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Marrow progenitor cell recovery was assessed for up to 4 years in 227 patients. One hundred patients were treated for malignant lymphomas by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 127 by peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT). RESULTS: Marrow progenitor cell counts were decreased for several years with both bone marrow and peripheral blood grafts. They were not different according to the origin of the graft, despite the reduced duration of peripheral blood cell recovery observed after PBPCT. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used for PB graft mobilization and after transplantation resulted in faster neutrophil recovery compared to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with no evidence of decreased marrow progenitor cell recoveries. On the other hand, postgraft administration of GM-CSF enhanced long-term colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage reconstitution only after BMT. Factors that influenced marrow progenitor cell reconstitution have been identified by univariate and multivariate analysis: age, gender, type of lymphoma, and postgraft administration of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) for the whole patient group; gender, graft progenitor cell yields, and type of HGF (G-CSF vs GM-CSF) for the PBPCT group; and only type of HGF for the BMT group. Despite faster peripheral blood cell recovery, persistent deficiency of marrow progenitor cells was found several years after PBPCT, as observed after BMT. G-CSF-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster neutrophil recovery compared to GM-CSF mobilization, with no difference in long-term hematopoietic reconstitution.","['Benboubker, Lotfi', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Roingeard, Francoise', 'Delain, Martine', 'Degenne, Michel', 'Linassier, Claude', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Truglio, Danielle', 'Bout, Myrtille', 'Petit, Andre', 'Bremond, Jean Louis', 'Desbois, Isabelle', 'Colombat, Philippe', 'Binet, Christian', 'Domenech, Jorge']","['Benboubker L', 'Cartron G', 'Roingeard F', 'Delain M', 'Degenne M', 'Linassier C', 'Herault O', 'Truglio D', 'Bout M', 'Petit A', 'Bremond JL', 'Desbois I', 'Colombat P', 'Binet C', 'Domenech J']","['Laboratory of Hematology, UPRES-EA 3249, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Tours, Tours, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X0201007X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01007-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jan;31(1):89-97. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01007-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMT also generated strong graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) response. However, clinical application of the protocol was hampered by the requirement for a relatively high dose of Cy (200 mg/kg). In this study we have tried to minimize the Cy dose by a concomitant blockade of CD40-CD40L interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mildly irradiated BALB/c mice were primed with C57BL/6 BM cells (BM(1)) and skin graft on day 0, injected with Cy (200 mg/kg or less) on day 1, and transplanted with a second C57BL/6 BM cell inoculum (BM(2)) on day 2. CD40L-specific antibody (MR1) was given with BM(1), BM(2), and 2 days later. Treated animals were monitored for survival, chimerism, and skin allograft rejection. The GVL potential of transplanted cells was examined in mice inoculated with BCL1 leukemia cells before irradiation. RESULTS: Blocking CD40-CD40L interaction with MR1 mAb allowed the reduction of a tolerance-generating Cy dose by 50%. Unfortunately, adding MR1 to the protocol reduced the GVL potential of the transplanted cells. Neither low-dose Cy nor antibodies alone could downregulate donor or recipient immune response. CONCLUSIONS: CD40L-specific antibodies synergize with Cy to induce bilateral transplantation tolerance. Therefore, their use may be beneficial for safer allogeneic BMT for nonmalignant indications. However, due to MR1-associated reduction of GVL effects, MR1 should be considered with caution as conditioning for BMT for leukemia-bearing recipients.","['Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Gurevitch, Olga', 'Elkin, Gregory', 'Morecki, Shoshana', 'Yakovlev, Elena', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Prigozhina TB', 'Gurevitch O', 'Elkin G', 'Morecki S', 'Yakovlev E', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Immunoconjugates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Safety', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010093 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01009-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Jan;31(1):81-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01009-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ineffective hemopoiesis in MDS produce the paradox of high intramedullary cellularity with peripheral cytopenias. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-11 regulate hemopoiesis and LIF, OSM, and IL-6 also inhibit the proliferation of myeloid leukemic cell lines through the signal-transducing subunit gp130. These IL-6-type cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell culture supernatants (SN) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) and monocyte-depleted MNC of patients with refractory anemia (RA; n=12) and healthy individuals (n=10). AZA down-regulated OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 release by MNC of patients but not by MNC from healthy individuals. Patient's SN had significantly lower concentrations of LIF, OSM, and IL-11 than SN of normal subjects. When monocyte-depleted MNC of patients were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin a significant increment in OSM levels was observed. In contrast, monocyte depletion in healthy subjects did not cause any significant change in OSM values. We conclude that: (a) AZA inhibits the release of OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 exclusively in RA-diseased MNC, (b) Patient's MNC release subnormal amounts of LIF, OSM, and IL-11, and (c) RA-derived monocytes probably down-regulate OSM release by phytohemagglutinin-activated MNC.","['Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Barrales-Benitez, Olga', 'Flores, Martin', 'Piedras, Josefa']","['Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Barrales-Benitez O', 'Flores M', 'Piedras J']","['Hematology and Oncology Department, Laboratory of Cell Biology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Vasco de Quiroga 15, Tlalpan 14000, Mexico, DF, Mexico. xlopezk@quetzal.innsz.mx']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/*blood/drug therapy', 'Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1043466602919988 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.2002.1998 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2002 Nov 24;20(4):154-62. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2002.1998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tiazofurin (TF) and 6-thioguanine (TG) are also used as chemotherapy agents in the treatment of malignancies. We have examined the induction of apoptosis by combinations of these drugs to gain more insights into their efficacy in the treatment of malignancies. METHODS: The induction of apoptosis was examined in Molt-4, a human malignant acute lymphoblastic T-cell line. The cells were exposed to increasing drug concentrations at various exposure times. Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) were used as markers for apoptosis and cell death. Annexin V/FITC positive and PI positive cells were detected by flow-cytometric analysis. RESULTS: Sequential 24-h exposure with MTX (0.005-0.02 micro mol) followed by 6MP (1-10 micro mol) and 24-h exposure with TF (5-20 micro mol) followed by TG (0.5-2 micro mol) showed a more than additive induction of apoptosis compared with single-drug exposure. Simultaneous administration of the drugs does not show an additive effect on apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that sequential administration of MTX before 6MP and of TF before TG may be essential for therapeutic success in the treatment of leukaemia.","['De Abreu, Ronney A', 'Trueworthy, Robert C', 'van Kuilenburg, Andre B P', 'Vogels-Mentink, Trude M', 'Lambooy, Lambert H J', 'van Gennip, Albert H']","['De Abreu RA', 'Trueworthy RC', 'van Kuilenburg AB', 'Vogels-Mentink TM', 'Lambooy LH', 'van Gennip AH']","['University Medical Center St Radboud, Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Pediatrics and Neurology, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. r.deabreu@cukz.umcn.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ann Clin Biochem,Annals of clinical biochemistry,0324055,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Models, Biological', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1258/000456303321016196 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Biochem. 2003 Jan;40(Pt 1):70-4. doi: 10.1258/000456303321016196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomere length decreases with cell divisions and age, and at a crucial length it is associated with chromosomal instability and cell senescence. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that adds nucleotides to chromosomal ends. Most somatic cells lack telomerase activity yet haematopoietic stem cells retain low levels of telomerase. Some studies have found that chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation lead to the accelerated shortening of telomere length. As granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is routinely used in the mobilization of stem cells for transplantation, we evaluated its effects on telomerase activity and regulation, and on telomere dynamics, in normal donors and selected lymphoma patients. Administration of G-CSF increased telomerase activity in CD34+ haematopoietic cells compared with controls. In marrow-derived CD34+ cells, telomerase activity increased sevenfold, compared with a 14-fold increase in peripheral-blood-mobilized CD34+ cells. A parallel increase in the expression of human telomerase enzyme reverse transcriptase RNA and protein kinase C alpha occurred. In addition, G-CSF administration to five lymphoma patients after consecutive courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy, resulted in telomere length preservation or elongation, as opposed to marked attrition in patients who did not receive growth factors. We conclude that the in vivo administration of G-CSF prevents or attenuates telomere attrition associated with chemotherapy administration. This attenuation may contribute to the preservation of telomere integrity inG-CSF-primed transplanted stem cells.","['Szyper-Kravitz, Martine', 'Uziel, Orit', 'Shapiro, Hava', 'Radnay, Judith', 'Katz, Tami', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Lishner, Michael', 'Lahav, Meir']","['Szyper-Kravitz M', 'Uziel O', 'Shapiro H', 'Radnay J', 'Katz T', 'Rowe JM', 'Lishner M', 'Lahav M']","['Medicine E, Sapir Medical Center, Meir Hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'RNA/analysis', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/03/22 04:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['4043 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04043.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jan;120(2):329-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04043.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As these are positively selected and are uncommon in normal B cells, they may have a role in tumour growth and behaviour. Sites are not characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or myeloma, but are detectable in approximately 50% of diffuse large cell lymphomas. Another feature of the variable region genes of certain lymphomas is ongoing somatic mutation. To determine whether glycosylation is associated with this phenomenon, we analysed variable region gene sequences of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Novel sites were common in endemic BL (82%) and in 4/5 patients with Iranian BL. However, sporadic BL had a lower incidence (43%). Patients with MALT lymphoma had a low frequency (9%) of novel sites, comparable to normal B cells. These findings distinguish glycosylation sites from ongoing mutation and may reflect different environmental influences on these tumours.","['Zhu, Delin', 'Ottensmeier, Christian H', 'Du, Ming-Qing', 'McCarthy, Helen', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Zhu D', 'Ottensmeier CH', 'Du MQ', 'McCarthy H', 'Stevenson FK']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals, UK.

High-risk patients received ceftazidime plus amikacin and low-risk patients received ceftazidime alone. All patients were hospitalized until fever and neutropenia resolved. Ninety one high-risk episodes were documented: 56 occurring in older patients (mean age 69 years) and 35 in younger adults (mean age 45 years). Non-Hodkgin's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia were the most frequent underlying neoplasias in both age groups. Intensity of chemotherapy was similar in both age groups. Mean neutrophil count at entry, median duration of neutropenia, rate of documented infection, incidence of bacteraemia, response to therapy, overall mortality and infectious mortality were similar in the two high-risk age subgroups. The elderly subgroup had a trend to have more Gram-negative infections and the younger patients more Gram-positive infections. In addition, 40 low-risk episodes were registered: 29 in elderly patients (mean age 68 years) and 11 in younger patients (mean age 44 years). Elderly low-risk patients had more concurrent diseases that younger ones (P = 0.124).

In all nine T-ALL samples studied, the leukaemic cells showed a marked reduction in the expression of the zeta chain, while a variety of tyrosine kinases (p56lck, ZAP70 and SYK) were normally present. There was no expression of the FcepsilonRIgamma chain. To confirm that this aberration was specific to immature T-ALL blasts, we investigated two patients with lymphoproliferative disorders of granular lymphocytes (LDGL), characterized by the expansion of mature T lymphocytes and found normal zeta chain expression. The reduction of the zeta chain protein was not reversible after 72 h stimulation with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and interleukin 2, either alone or in combination. Northern blot analysis indicated that the reduced protein expression did not correspond to a defect at the mRNA level, nor were mutations in the coding region of the zeta chain found. We, therefore, hypothesized that the observed reduction of protein expression in T-ALL blasts could be secondary to an increased degradation at the proteasome level. Following selective inhibition of the proteasome, a marked increase of the zeta chain expression was observed. Moreover, an increase in the surface expression of CD3 was also documented.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of high dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) on in vivo blast cell apoptosis in children with ALL. Annexin V-binding and Fas (CD95), Fas ligand (FasL; CD95L), and Bcl-2 expression in PB blasts were determined in newly diagnosed children with ALL before and 4, 24, 96 h after initiation of HDMP treatment (n=20) or conventional dose steroids (CDS) (n=10) as the control group. A decrease in absolute blast count (from 40.8 x 09 to 21.4 x 109/l) associated with an increase in apoptosis (14.2 to 26.9%) (P < 0.05) was detected 4 h after initiation of HDMP. A significant increase in Fas and FasL expression was detected 96 h after HDMP. There was no significant change in apoptosis, Fas and FasL expression from baseline in the control group treated with CDS. The changes in Bcl-2 expression after treatment was not significant in both groups. The results of this preliminary study have shown that HDMP treatment was effective in inducing immediate (within 4 h) blast cell apoptosis. The contribution of Fas/FasL interaction in the rapid component of cell kill remains to be determined, as the increase in the expression of these molecules was evident later.","['Uckan, D', 'Yetgin, S', 'Cetin, M', 'Ozyurek, E', 'Okur, H', 'Aslan, D', 'Tuncer, M']","['Uckan D', 'Yetgin S', 'Cetin M', 'Ozyurek E', 'Okur H', 'Aslan D', 'Tuncer M']","[""Division of Paediatric Haematology, Ihsan Dogramac Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.duckan@hacettepe.edu.tr""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/analysis/biosynthesis']",,2003/01/25 04:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/01/25 04:00'],"['2003/01/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['475 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00475.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Feb;25(1):35-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00475.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, LAT (linker for activation of T cells), a molecule involved in T-cell activation and platelet aggregation, was found to be expressed by megakaryocytes and platelets in tissue sections. We compared VWF and LAT immunoreactivity on megakaryocytes in 64 bone marrow biopsies from 12 normal controls (NC), and from patients with MDS (n=18), CMPD (n=21) and acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AML-M7, n=13). Immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections with polyclonal antibodies against VWF and LAT. Immunoreactivity was evaluated by counting positive megakaryocytes in 10 high-power fields, and values were compared using Student's t test for paired data. Both VWF and LAT predominantly stained the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes, although LAT was also recognizable on the cell membrane. In most biopsies, the immunoreactivity of the two antibodies was quite similar. No significant differences were noticed between the mean values of VWF+ and LAT+ megakaryocytes. However, in 22 cases (5 NC; 5 MDS; 6 CMPD; 6 AML-M7), the number of LAT+ megakaryocytes was at least 30% higher than VWF+cells, while in 3 cases opposite findings were found. In 3 AML-M7 cases, anti-LAT antibodies stained numerous megakaryocytes, but anti-VWF staining was practically negative; in another 5 AML-M7 cases, anti-LAT labeling was much stronger than anti-VWF staining.

It seems to be expressed by megakaryocytes more than VWF in most cases and, particularly, in conditions associated with poorly differentiated megakaryocytes, such as acute megakaryocytic leukemias.

Specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryonic development requires the stem cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene product. Forced expression of SCL/tal-1 strongly induces blood formation in embryos, indicating that this gene has a dominant role in commitment to haematopoiesis. In the adult haematopoietic system, expression of SCL/tal-1 is enriched in HSCs and multipotent progenitors, and in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, consistent with roles for this factor in adult haematopoiesis. Here we assess by conditional gene targeting whether SCL/tal-1 is required continuously for the identity and function of HSCs. We find that SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for HSC engraftment, self-renewal and differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lineages; however, the proper differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors is dependent on SCL/tal-1. Thus, SCL/tal-1 is essential for the genesis of HSCs, but its continued expression is not essential for HSC functions. These findings contrast with lineage choice mechanisms, in which the identity of haematopoietic lineages requires continuous transcription factor expression.","['Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Klintman, Jenny', 'Yang, Haidi', 'Hock, Hanno', 'Schlaeger, Thorsten M', 'Fujiwara, Yuko', 'Orkin, Stuart H']","['Mikkola HK', 'Klintman J', 'Yang H', 'Hock H', 'Schlaeger TM', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Orkin SH']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",,2003/01/24 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2003/01/24 04:00'],"['2002/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature01345 [doi]', 'nature01345 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2003 Jan 30;421(6922):547-51. doi: 10.1038/nature01345.

A., and Monk, P. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 7165-7169). Here we demonstrate that C5L2 binds the metabolites of C4a and C3a, C4a des-Arg(77), and C3a des-Arg(77) (also known as the acylation-stimulating protein or ASP) at a site distinct from the C5a binding site. The binding of these metabolites to C5L2 does not stimulate the degranulation of transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells either through endogenous rat G proteins or when co-transfected with human G(alpha 16). C3a des-Arg(77)/ASP and C3a can potently stimulate triglyceride synthesis in human skin fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Here we show that both cell types and human adipose tissue express C5L2 mRNA and that the human fibroblasts express C5L2 protein at the cell surface. This is the first demonstration of the expression of C5L2 in cells that bind and respond to C3a des-Arg(77)/ASP and C3a. Thus C5L2, a promiscuous complement fragment-binding protein with a high affinity site that binds C3a des-Arg(77)/ASP, may mediate the acylation-stimulating properties of this peptide.","['Kalant, David', 'Cain, Stuart A', 'Maslowska, Magdalena', 'Sniderman, Allan D', 'Cianflone, Katherine', 'Monk, Peter N']","['Kalant D', 'Cain SA', 'Maslowska M', 'Sniderman AD', 'Cianflone K', 'Monk PN']","['Mike Rosenbloom Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Division of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1A1, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (C5aR2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (complement C3a, des-Arg-(77)-)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C3a/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2003/01/24 04:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/01/24 04:00'],"['2003/01/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M206169200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32392-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 28;278(13):11123-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M206169200.

The mechanism by which PML regulates cell death remains unclear. In this study we found that ectopic expression of PML potentiates cell death by apoptosis in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-resistant cell line U2OS and other cell lines. Treatment with TNFalpha significantly sensitized these cells to apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. PML/TNFalpha-induced cell death is associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -7, and -8, and degradation of DNA fragmentation factor/inhibitor of CAD. PML/TNFalpha-induced cell death could be blocked by the caspase-8 inhibitors CrmA and c-FLIP but not by Bcl-2. These findings indicate that this cell death event is initiated through the death receptor-dependent apoptosis pathway. PML is a transcriptional repressor of NF-kappaB by interacting with RelA/p65 and prevents its binding to the cognate enhancer through the C terminus. Coimmunoprecipitation and double-color immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that PML physically interacts with RelA/p65 in vivo and the two proteins colocalized at the endogenous levels. Overexpression of NF-kappaB rescued cell death induced by PML/TNFalpha. Furthermore, PML(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts are more resistant to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Together this study defines a novel mechanism by which PML induces apoptosis through repression of the NF-kappaB survival pathway.","['Wu, Wen-Shu', 'Xu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Hittelman, Walter N', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Chang, Kun-Sang']","['Wu WS', 'Xu ZX', 'Hittelman WN', 'Salomoni P', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, the University of Texas M.

It was concluded that chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in human leukaemic cells (UG37, HL-60) is independent of the Fas/FasL system, but combination of sFasL and drug treatment produces a synergistic cytotoxic effect on human leukaemic cells.","['Zou, P', 'Liu, Z', 'Xiao, J']","['Zou P', 'Liu Z', 'Xiao J']","['Institute of Hematology, Xiehe Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Tongji Med Univ,Journal of Tongji Medical University = Tong ji yi ke da xue xue bao,8605495,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'HL-60 Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'U937 Cells/immunology/pathology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",,2003/01/24 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/01/24 04:00'],"['2003/01/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02886432 [doi]'],ppublish,J Tongji Med Univ. 2001;21(3):212-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02886432.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify a new mechanism for disrupting Notch signaling in human tumorigenesis, characterized by altered function of a new ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster Notch co-activator molecule Mastermind. We cloned the t(11;19) translocation that underlies the most common type of human malignant salivary gland tumor. This rearrangement fuses exon 1 from a novel gene of unknown function at 19p13, termed mucoepidermoid carcinoma translocated 1 (MECT1), with exons 2-5 of a novel member of the Mastermind-like gene family (MAML2) at 11q21 (ref. 3). Similar to D. melanogaster Mastermind and MAML1 (refs. 4,5), full-length MAML2 functioned as a CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless and Lag-1)-dependent transcriptional co-activator for ligand-stimulated Notch. In contrast, MECT1-MAML2 activated transcription of the Notch target gene HES1 independently of both Notch ligand and CSL binding sites. MECT1-MAML2 induced foci formation in RK3E epithelial cells, confirming a biological effect for the fusion product. These data suggest a new mechanism to disrupt the function of a Notch co-activator in a common type of malignant salivary gland tumor.","['Tonon, Giovanni', 'Modi, Sanjay', 'Wu, Lizi', 'Kubo, Akihito', 'Coxon, Amy B', 'Komiya, Takefumi', ""O'Neil, Kevin"", 'Stover, Kristen', 'El-Naggar, Adel', 'Griffin, James D', 'Kirsch, Ilan R', 'Kaye, Frederic J']","['Tonon G', 'Modi S', 'Wu L', 'Kubo A', 'Coxon AB', 'Komiya T', ""O'Neil K"", 'Stover K', 'El-Naggar A', 'Griffin JD', 'Kirsch IR', 'Kaye FJ']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute and the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland 20889, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-2 Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MAML1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (mam protein, Drosophila)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-2 Protein', 'Karyotyping', 'Ligands', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/metabolism', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2002/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng1083 [doi]', 'ng1083 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2003 Feb;33(2):208-13. doi: 10.1038/ng1083.

Because we have demonstrated previously that transplanted bone marrow cells can enter the brain of mice and differentiate into neurons there, we decided to examine postmortem brain samples from females who had received bone marrow transplants from male donors. The underlying diseases of the patients were lymphocytic leukemia and genetic deficiency of the immune system, and they survived between 1 and 9 months after transplant. We used a combination of immunocytochemistry (utilizing neuron-specific antibodies) and fluorescent in situ hybridization histochemistry to search for Y chromosome-positive cells. In all four patients studied we found cells containing Y chromosomes in several brain regions. Most of them were nonneuronal (endothelial cells and cells in the white matter), but neurons were certainly labeled, especially in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The youngest patient (2 years old), who also lived the longest time after transplantation, had the greatest number of donor-derived neurons (7 in 10,000). The distribution of the labeled cells was not homogeneous. There were clusters of Y-positive cells, suggesting that single progenitor cells underwent clonal expansion and differentiation. We conclude that adult human bone marrow cells can enter the brain and generate neurons just as rodent cells do.

The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) gene products are a family of cytoplasmic molecules that are essential mediators for negatively regulating cytokine signaling. It has been previously shown that IL-10 induced SOCS3 expression and that forced constitutive expression of SOCS3 inhibits IL-10/STAT3 activation and LPS-induced macrophage activation. In this report, we show that, in addition to SOCS3 expression, IL-10 induces SOCS1 up-regulation in all cell lines tested, including Ba/F3 pro-B cells, MC/9 mast cells, M1 leukemia cells, U3A human fibroblasts, and primary mouse CD4(+) T cells. Induction of SOCS molecules is dependent on STAT3 activation by IL-10R1. Cell lines constitutively overexpressing SOCS proteins demonstrated that SOCS1 and SOCS3, but not SOCS2, are able to partially inhibit IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation and proliferative responses. Pretreatment of M1 cells with IFN-gamma resulted in SOCS1 induction and a reduction of IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation and cell growth inhibition. IL-10-induced SOCS is associated with the inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling in various cell types, and this inhibition is independent of C-terminal serine residues of the IL-10R, previously shown to be required for other anti-inflammatory responses. Thus, the present results show that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by IL-10 and may be important inhibitors of both IL-10 and IFN-gamma signaling. IL-10-induced SOCS1 may directly inhibit IL-10 IFN-gamma signaling, while inhibition of other proinflammatory cytokine responses may use additional IL-10R1-mediated mechanisms.","['Ding, Yaozhong', 'Chen, Dongmei', 'Tarcsafalvi, Adel', 'Su, Ruthie', 'Qin, Lihui', 'Bromberg, Jonathan S']","['Ding Y', 'Chen D', 'Tarcsafalvi A', 'Su R', 'Qin L', 'Bromberg JS']","['Carl C.

This strategy is limited though, as it is often difficult, if not impossible, to obtain T cells of clinical value. The transfer of TCR genes to mature T cells to generate tumor-reactive T cells provides a potential mechanism to overcome these limitations. To evaluate the feasibility of such an approach and the quality of the resulting T cells, we generated replication-deficient retroviral vectors using the well-characterized OT-1 TCR genes. After transducing murine T cells, we were able to expand large numbers of Ag-specific T cells that were functionally active against tumor cells expressing the relevant Ag. Furthermore, we found that T cells expressing retrovirally encoded TCR had avidity that was similar to that of the parental clone. This maintenance of avidity was despite variable expression of the retrovirally encoded TCR and the presence of potentially competing endogenous TCRs. These results suggest that the inherent qualities of the TCR, as dictated by the coding sequence, are the most critical parameters in the generation of high-avidity T cells.","['Rubinstein, Mark P', 'Kadima, Andre N', 'Salem, Mohamed L', 'Nguyen, Christophe L', 'Gillanders, William E', 'Nishimura, Michael I', 'Cole, David J']","['Rubinstein MP', 'Kadima AN', 'Salem ML', 'Nguyen CL', 'Gillanders WE', 'Nishimura MI', 'Cole DJ']","['Department of Surgery, Section of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Egg Proteins)', '0 (OVA-8)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Egg Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor alpha/immunology', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Ovalbumin/genetics/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/03/28 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.3.1209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Feb 1;170(3):1209-17. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.3.1209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XIAP functions as a caspase inhibitor and is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins. IAPs are often overexpressed in cancers and leukemias and are associated with an unfavorable clinical prognosis. We have selected peptides from a phage library by using recombinant full-length human XIAP or a fragment containing only the baculovirus IAP repeat 2 (BIR2) domain. A consensus motif, C(D/E/P)(W/F/Y)-acid/basic-XC, was recovered from two independent screenings by using different libraries. Phage-displaying variations of the consensus sequence bound specifically to the BIR2 domain of XIAP but not to other IAPs. The interaction was specific as it could be blocked by the cognate synthetic peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Phage displaying the XIAP-binding motif CEFESC bound to the BIR2 domain of XIAP with an estimated dissociation constant of 1.8 nm as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-7 (but not caspase-8) blocked the binding of the CEFESC phage to XIAP, indicating that this peptide targets a domain within XIAP that is related to the caspase-binding site. In fact, the sequence EFES is homologous to a loop unique to the executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 that are targeted by XIAP. Finally, we demonstrated that an internalizing version of the XIAP-binding peptide identified in our screenings (PFKQ) can induce programmed cell death in leukemia cells. Peptides interacting with XIAP could serve as prototypes for the design of low molecular weight modulators of apoptosis.","['Tamm, Ingo', 'Trepel, Martin', 'Cardo-Vila, Marina', 'Sun, Yan', 'Welsh, Kate', 'Cabezas, Edelmira', 'Swatterthwait, Arnold', 'Arap, Wadih', 'Reed, John C', 'Pasqualini, Renata']","['Tamm I', 'Trepel M', 'Cardo-Vila M', 'Sun Y', 'Welsh K', 'Cabezas E', 'Swatterthwait A', 'Arap W', 'Reed JC', 'Pasqualini R']","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 97037, USA.']",['eng'],"['AG15402/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA8297601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA9081001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Time Factors', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M210133200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64596-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 18;278(16):14401-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M210133200.

These and others like IL-11 and ciliary neurotrophic factor are referred to as the gp130 cytokines because they share the gp130 glycoprotein as a common receptor initial signal transducer. We and others have shown that gp130 cytokines and their receptors are expressed and functional in normal and tumoral anterior pituitary cells. To study the role of gp130 cytokines in tumorigenic process, we generated gp130 cDNA gp130 sense and gp130 antisense (gp130-AS) transfected stable clones derived from lactosomatotroph GH3 cells. We examined hormone secretion and cell proliferation of these clones as well as their tumorigenic properties in athymic nude mice. Although gp130-AS clones, which have low gp130 levels and impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activity and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression, showed reduced proliferation and hormone secretion (GH and prolactin) in response to gp130 cytokines, they had a normal response to gp130-independent stimuli. Moreover, gp130-AS clones showed a severely impaired in vivo tumor development. In contrast, the overexpressing gp130 clones (gp130 sense) showed no differences, compared with cells transfected with control vector. Thus, the present study provides new evidence supporting a link between gp130 and pituitary abnormal growth.","['Castro, Carolina Perez', 'Giacomini, Damiana', 'Nagashima, Alberto Carbia', 'Onofri, Chiara', 'Graciarena, Mariana', 'Kobayashi, Ken', 'Paez-Pereda, Marcelo', 'Renner, Ulrich', 'Stalla, Gunter K', 'Arzt, Eduardo']","['Castro CP', 'Giacomini D', 'Nagashima AC', 'Onofri C', 'Graciarena M', 'Kobayashi K', 'Paez-Pereda M', 'Renner U', 'Stalla GK', 'Arzt E']","['Departamento de Fisiologia y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Laboratorio de Fisiologia y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, C1428EHA Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hormones/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2002-220891 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2003 Feb;144(2):693-700. doi: 10.1210/en.2002-220891.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doxorubicin (DOX) increased the ceramide level and apoptosis in drug-sensitive HL-60 cells but not in drug-resistant HL-60/ADR cells, under the condition that the uptake of DOX was not different between the two cell lines. In addition, exogenous N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) enhanced DOX-induced apoptosis in HL-60/ADR cells without affecting the expression of multidrug resistant-1 protein (MDR 1) and the uptake of DOX. A lower level of ceramide with higher activities of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) was detected in HL-60/ADR cells than in HL-60 cells. In contrast, HL-60/GCS cells, overexpressing GCS, significantly inhibited DOX-induced ceramide increase and apoptosis. These observations suggest the involvement of ceramide regulation in drug resistance of leukemia cells. In vivo, the level of ceramide was lower in chemoresistant leukemia patients (6.4 +/- 1.8 pmol/nmol phosphate; n = 14) than in chemosensitive patients (9.5 +/- 2.7 pmol/nmol phosphate; n = 9), and the activities of GCS and SMS were more than 2-fold higher in chemoresistant leukemia cells than in chemosensitive cells. MDR-1 protein was faintly expressed in one of four chemoresistant patients, but Bcl-2 were clearly detected in four patients. Therefore, it is suggested that a decrease of the ceramide level via activation of GCS and SMS is associated with the chemoresistant condition in leukemia, probably in relation to Bcl-2 but not to MDR-1 expression.","['Itoh, Mitsuru', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Watanabe, Mitsumasa', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Yabu, Takeshi', 'Taguchi, Yoshimitu', 'Iwai, Kazuya', 'Tashima, Masaro', 'Uchiyama, Takashi', 'Okazaki, Toshiro']","['Itoh M', 'Kitano T', 'Watanabe M', 'Kondo T', 'Yabu T', 'Taguchi Y', 'Iwai K', 'Tashima M', 'Uchiyama T', 'Okazaki T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.8.- (Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups))', 'EC 2.7.8.- (phosphatidylcholine-ceramide phosphocholine transferase)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Ceramides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/*metabolism']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jan;9(1):415-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flavopiridol modulates cell cycle progression, inhibits transcription, and induces apoptosis. We designed an in vitro model of timed sequential therapy for acute leukemia to determine whether flavopiridol can: (a). trigger apoptosis in fresh acute leukemia; and (b). recruit surviving leukemic cells to a proliferative state, thereby priming such cells for the S-phase-related cytotoxicity of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bone marrow cells from 20 adults with relapsed and refractory acute leukemias were enriched for blasts by Ficoll Hypaque sedimentation. Blasts were cultured on day 0 in flavopiridol 250 nM for 24 h, removed from flavopiridol for 24 h, and then cultured in ara-C 1 microM for an additional 72 h (F(250)A(1)). Apoptosis and cell cycle phase distribution were estimated from cells stained with propidium iodide. Cell survival was determined after the 72 h ara-C exposure by double cytofluorescence assay with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. RESULTS: Flavopiridol induced a 4.3-fold increase in apoptosis in human leukemia samples within the first 24 h of culture. Subsequent removal of flavopiridol led to a 1.7-fold increase in the proportion of cells in S phase by day 2. Mean survival in F(250)A(1) cultures after 72 h exposure to ara-C was 35.6% compared with flavopiridol alone (F(250)A(0), 56.1%; P = 0.0003) and ara-C alone (F(0)A(1), 65.2%; P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Flavopiridol induces apoptosis in marrow blasts from patients with refractory acute leukemias. Furthermore, flavopiridol pretreatment increases the proapoptotic and cytotoxic effects of ara-C. The advantage of sequential FP(250)A(1) over either agent alone is seen for both acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These findings support a clinical trial of timed sequential therapy where flavopiridol is given for cytoreduction and subsequent priming of remaining leukemic cells for enhanced cycle-dependent drug cytotoxicity.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Ross, Douglas D', 'Yang, Weidong', 'Tidwell, Michael L', 'Wei, Yuetong', 'Greer, Jacqueline', 'Mann, Dean L', 'Nakanishi, Takeo', 'Wright, John J', 'Colevas, A Dmitri']","['Karp JE', 'Ross DD', 'Yang W', 'Tidwell ML', 'Wei Y', 'Greer J', 'Mann DL', 'Nakanishi T', 'Wright JJ', 'Colevas AD']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland 2120, USA. jkarp2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA77545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA82888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA69854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'S Phase', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jan;9(1):307-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a neoplasia characterized by massive invasion of the leukemic cells into various organs. Recently, we have reported frequent hepatic involvement and the relationship between liver invasion and the poor prognosis in ATL. In the present study, we investigated the expression of c-Met in ATL cells and its relation to liver dysfunction. In three of four human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I-positive T-cell lines, c-Met was expressed both at mRNA and protein levels, whereas it was not expressed in human T-cell lymphoma virus-I-negative T-cell lines. The expressed c-Met should be functional, because hepatocyte growth factor could induce the autophosphorylation of c-Met. Although the viral-transactivating protein Tax has been shown to be involved in the deregulated expression of cellular genes, Tax mRNA was not detected in c-Met mRNA-expressed cell lines. From freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression of c-Met mRNA was detected in 10 of 16 ATL patients but not from healthy individuals. Finally, serum transaminase levels were significantly increased in c-Met-positive ATL cases, and all of the infiltrated c-Met-positive cells into liver were shown to be multilobularly nucleated phenotype.

Thirty-nine of these specimens were also analyzed for their NY-ESO-1 expression. RESULTS: Only 1 of 7 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia expressed a CT gene (HOM-TES-14/SCP-1), and 10 follicular lymphomas were negative for all of the CT genes tested. In B-cell lymphomas, the most frequent expression of CT genes was observed in diffuse large-cell lymphomas (HOM-TES-14/SCP-1: 7 of 28; SSX-1: 5 of 28; CT-7: 2 of 28; and HOM-MEL-40/SSX-2 and HOM-TES-85: 1 of 28 positive cases).

At a median follow-up time of 26 months, higher QC-PCR values within each cytogenetic category at 3, 6, and 9 months have not been associated with a higher occurrence cytogenetic relapse or disease progression. However, the significance of this may become different with longer follow-up. CONCLUSION: QC-PCR studies provide a useful tool to monitor patients with CML on imatinib mesylate therapy.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Giles, Francis', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Thomas D', 'Giles F', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Arlinghaus R']","['Departments of Leukemia, M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jan;9(1):160-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have assessed the MMR status of a range of leukaemic cell lines using an in vitro repair assay and correlated this with protein expression of the best characterized components of the system. We have also assessed MMR in leukaemic blasts from a limited panel of children with ALL and related this to Ki67 expression as a measure of proliferative capacity. Out of nine leukaemic cell lines tested, five of the seven lymphoid lines showed little or no repair using the in vitro assay and had low MMR protein expression. In three (NALM-6, Reh and MOLT 4) MMR defects have not been previously reported. Immunohistochemistry of clinical samples showed a wide range of expression of MLH1, MSH2 and Ki67 in nine cases studied at presentation, with a highly statistically significant correlation between MLH1 and Ki67 expression (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.0001, Pearson correlation). Western blotting demonstrated high expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins. In vitro analysis of G.T repair using lymphoblast cytosol from the same patients showed a wide range of proficiency, which was markedly reduced in one case studied at relapse. These results suggest that MMR defects are more common in leukaemic cell lines and acute lymphoblastic leukaemias than previously thought.","['Matheson, Elizabeth C', 'Hall, Andrew G']","['Matheson EC', 'Hall AG']","['The LRF Molecular Pharmacology Specialist Programme, Cancer Research Unit, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Pair Mismatch/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/24.1.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2003 Jan;24(1):31-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/24.1.31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutation rate of genes other than mismatch repair or p53 is the same in colon cancer and in normal cells, indicating that a 'mutator phenotype', increasing the rate of mutations in many genes, is not an essential feature of sporadic cancers; conversely, fusion genes, TEL-AML1/AML1-ETO, typical of leukemia, are 100 times more frequent at birth than in overt leukemia in children, indicating that further selective events are needed to cause malignancy. The devastating impairment of immunity, as in AIDS patients, does not cause cancer other than Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, although immunological control is considered to be an essential mechanism in preventing the spread of cancer cells. These observations suggest that cell-specific additional events are needed to explain carcinogenesis. Carcinogenesis has been traditionally interpreted as the sequence of initiation (mutation) and promotion (clone expansion), with an interesting similarity with the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, based on a first stage of genetic change (including recombination) and a second stage of selection. I propose that carcinogenesis consists in two general phases (not necessarily stages), i.e. genetic change followed by clone expansion (selective advantage). As in neo-Darwinian theory selection is chiefly represented by the elimination of the less fit, the selection of mutated cells would mainly consist in resistance to apoptosis or other types of 'bottlenecks' that hamper a cell's survival; an example of such a bottleneck is the autoimmunity that induces paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in individuals with PIG-A mutations. Cancer rates show great variation in different countries around the world, a variation only marginally explained by genetic differences. More interestingly, migrants change their risk of cancer by adapting to that of the population into which they move: as these changes are not likely to be entirely due to mutagens in the environment, we have to invoke selective pressure over mutated cells to explain them. My theory is that mutated cells adapt to environmental 'niches' better than normal cells, in a 'gene-environment interaction' that involves the history of the genetic changes the cell has undergone and the kind of environment in which it happens to live.","['Vineis, Paolo']",['Vineis P'],"['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Torino, via Santena 7, 10126 Torino, Italy and ISI Foundation, Torino, Italy. paolo.vineis@unito.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Biological', '*Biological Evolution', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Environment', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Selection, Genetic']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/24.1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2003 Jan;24(1):1-6. doi: 10.1093/carcin/24.1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the use of cranial irradiation may have a role to play in long term sequelae. AIMS: To investigate neuropsychological functioning among children treated for leukaemia without cranial irradiation. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, 17 leukaemic patients and their sibling controls were assessed using a neuropsychological model of attention. All were treated on the UKALL XI protocol and none had received cranial irradiation. Participants completed the Arithmetic subtest and Digit Span subtest of the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to assess focus-encode elements of attention; the Coding subtest and the Speed of Information subtest of the BAS to assess focus-execute aspects of attention; the VIGIL computerised battery to assess sustain elements of attention; and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test to assess the ability to shift attention. RESULTS: These children did not exhibit the deficits witnessed in previous cohorts, and were performing at comparable levels to their controls on all measures of attention CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that children who have received treatment for leukaemia without the use of cranial irradiation do not show the neuropsychological insult found in earlier treatment groups.","['Rodgers, J', 'Marckus, R', 'Kearns, P', 'Windebank, K']","['Rodgers J', 'Marckus R', 'Kearns P', 'Windebank K']","['Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, University of Newcastle, UK.

N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-all-trans-retinamide (fenretinide, 4-HPR) is a synthetic ATRA derivative with chemopreventive and cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines including myeloid leukemia. Although several modes of action have been postulated, its mechanism of action in hematologic malignancies remains unclear. Furthermore, only limited information exists as to its activity in lymphoid malignancies. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether 4-HPR has activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we first analyzed its antiproliferative effect in five ALL (Z-33, Z-138, Z-119, Z-181, and Jurkat) cell lines. We found that 4-HPR inhibited the proliferation of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 microM. We further demonstrated by cell cycle analysis that 5 microM of 4-HPR blocked Z-119 cells in S phase thus preventing their progression through the cycle. Next we tested whether 4-HPR activated the caspase pathway and induced apoptotic cell death. We found that 4-HPR induced apoptosis in Z-119 cells through the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We then asked whether 4-HPR could affect fresh ALL progenitor cells. Therefore, we obtained bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from five patients with newly diagnosed ALL and tested the effect of 4-HPR using the ALL blast colony culture assay. To supplement our results, we also performed the ALL blast assay on one ALL cell line (ALL-1). We found that 4-HPR significantly inhibited ALL colony-forming cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that 4-HPR is a potent inhibitor of ALL cell proliferation and that it induces in vitro apoptotic cell death in ALL blasts. Further studies are warranted to establish the in vivo effect of 4-HPR particularly in patients with ALL.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Lotan, Reuben', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Harris, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Lotan R', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, P.O.

The same difference was also observed in time to 25% of patients evolving to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our study confirmed usefulness of separation of RCMD from RA. RCMD represents a poor prognostic subgroup of MDS clearly distinct from pure RA mainly due to short survival connected with progressive bone marrow failure and increased risk of leukemic transformation. We also suggest to define 5q- syndrome as primary MDS of FAB type RA with 5q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality confirmed by FISH analysis.

High-dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) has been proposed as salvage therapy in combination with amsacrine. The aim of the current study was first to assess the toxicity and the efficacy of such a combination therapy, and secondly to determine prognostic factors allowing to predict whom patients could benefit of such a treatment. Out of 91, 45 patients referred to our institution have been treated by HD-AraC (3 g/m(2)/12h from day 1 to 4) combined with amsacrine (90 mg/m(2) per day from day 5 to 7) as a salvage regimen. Forty-five of the 91 patients (49%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 39-60%) achieved complete remission (CR). Thirty-five patients were refractory to the salvage therapy and 11 patients died from toxicity during aplasia. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 11.5 months (95% CI: 6-16 months). After CR achievement, 26 patients received consolidation therapy according to the protocol in which they were included. Nineteen patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. At time of analysis, 27 of the 45 patients (60%) who achieved CR have relapsed. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 months (95% CI: 6-15 months). There was 12 long survivors (13%). In univariate analysis, initial karyotype was the main prognostic factor as well as in terms of CR achievement (P=0.002) than in terms of DFS (P=0.01) or OS (P=0.009). CR achievement was negatively influenced by higher WHO performance status index (P=0.006), higher LDH level (P=0.02), and higher CD34 expression by leukemic cells (P=0.03) at diagnosis, and presence of circulating blasts (P=0.001), platelet count <80 x 10(9)/l (P=0.0001), and polymorphonuclear (PMN) percentage <30% (P=0.01) at time of starting salvage therapy. DFS was negatively influenced by secondary AML (P=0.01), weight loss > or =5% (P=0.03), and higher white blood cell (WBC) count (P=0.03) at time of diagnosis. Age over 60 years (P=0.002), prior history of toxic exposure (P=0.01), higher CD34 expression (P=0.02), weight loss > or =5% (P=0.006), and WHO performance status index > or =2 (P=0.01) at diagnosis, and platelet count <80 x 10(9)/l (P=0.02) at time of salvage therapy were the main prognostic factors associated with shorter OS. In multivariate analysis, karyotype grouping at diagnosis (P=0.006) and blood count before salvage therapy (P=0.001) were of prognostic value for CR achievement. Karyotype remained of prognostic value for DFS and OS (P=0.007 and <0.0001, respectively).We conclude that HD-AraC combined with amsacrine was as a useful salvage regimen in AML non-responding to a first intensive course of chemotherapy. Using objective parameters of proven significance (karyotypic grouping and blood count before salvage), we devised a prognostic system of immediate clinical utility for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapeutic choices. Patients with favorable risk cytogenetics and those with intermediate risk cytogenetics and favorable blood count (PMN > or =30%, no circulating blasts, and platelet count > or =80 x 10(9)/l) before salvage therapy had a similar outcome than those achieving CR after only one course of chemotherapy. All other patients displayed a poor outcome. This suggests their orientation at an earlier time to alternate therapeutic programs based on investigational drugs.","['Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Le, Quoc-Hung', 'Elhamri, Mohamed', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Tavernier E', 'Le QH', 'Elhamri M', 'Thomas X']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000899 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00089-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Mar;27(3):205-14. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00089-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to characterize the molecular events leading to AETD-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells (annexin-V-positive cell population) increased dose- and time-dependently after AETD exposure. Apoptosis of HL-60 cells by AETD was associated with the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and the activation of caspase-3. Pretreating the cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) and the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk abrogated AETD-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. NAC blocked intracellular ROS formation and GSH depletion, but Z-DEVD-fmk did not. These results indicate that AETD induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells by causing intracellular ROS formation and GSH depletion followed by the downstream event of caspase-3 activation.","['Pae, H O', 'Oh, G S', 'Choi, B M', 'Seo, E A', 'Oh, H', 'Shin, M K', 'Kim, T H', 'Kwon, T O', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Oh GS', 'Choi BM', 'Seo EA', 'Oh H', 'Shin MK', 'Kim TH', 'Kwon TO', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medicinal Resources Research Center of Wonkwang University, 344-2 Shinyong-Dong, Iksan-Shi, Chonbuk 570-749, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (4-acetyl-12,13-epoxy-9-trichothecene-3,15-diol)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Trichothecenes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascomycota/*chemistry', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*adverse effects', 'Trichothecenes/*pharmacology']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233302000978 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(02)00097-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2003 Feb;17(1):49-57. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(02)00097-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gleevec binds specifically to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity. It cross-reacts with another two important membrane tyrosine kinase receptors, c-kit and PDGF receptors. We sought to investigate if Gleevec has a potential role in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: We have shown that Gleevec alone can inhibit the A549 lung cancer cell growth in dose-dependent manner, and the optimal concentration of Gleevec inhibition of A549 cell growth is at the range of 2-3 microM (IC50). We have also shown that A549 cells are resistant to cisplatin treatment (IC50 64 microM). Addition of Gleevec to the A549 cells treated with cisplatin resulted in a synergistic cell killing effect, suggesting that Gleevec can potentiate the effect of cisplatin on A549 cells. We also showed that the A549 lung cancer cells expresses the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha, and the inhibitory effects of Gleevec on A549 cells is likely mediated through inhibition of PDGFR alpha phosphorylation. We further tested 33 lung cancer patients' tumor specimens to see the frequency of PDGFR-alpha expression by tissue micro-arrays and immunohistochemistry. We found that 16 of the 18 squamous carcinomas (89%), 11 of the 11 adenocarcinomas (100%), and 4 of the 4 small cell lung cancers (100%) expressed PDGFR-alpha. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a potential role of Gleevec as adjuvant therapeutic agent for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","['Zhang, Peilin', 'Gao, Wei Yi', 'Turner, Steven', 'Ducatman, Barbara S']","['Zhang P', 'Gao WY', 'Turner S', 'Ducatman BS']","['Department of Pathology & Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Robert C.

To reduce the number of probes required for each gene, a systematic approach to choosing the most representative probes is needed. A method is presented for reducing the number of probes per gene while maximizing the fidelity to the original array design. RESULTS: The methodology has been tested on a dataset comprising 317 Affymetrix HuGeneFL GeneChips. The performance of the original and reduced probe sets was compared in four cancer-classification problems. The results of these comparisons show that reduction of the probe set by 95% does not dramatically affect performance, and thus illustrate the feasibility of substantially reducing probe numbers without significantly compromising sensitivity and specificity of detection.

A total of 5,527 deaths were ascertained among 176,000 male workers who had been retrospectively and/or prospectively followed for an average of 7.9 years during the observation period 1986-1997. Statistical analyses were made mainly on the prospective follow-up outcome of 120,000 workers followed for an average of 4.5 years. The standardized mortality ratio (and its 95% confidence interval) was 0.94 (0.90, 0.97) for 2,934 cases of all causes combined and 0.86 (0.82, 0.91) for 1,305 cases of non-malignant diseases combined, which suggested a healthy worker effect. For 1,191 cases of all cancers combined, it was 0.98 (0.93, 1.04), indicating no difference in mortality from that of the general population. In tests for trend of death rate with increasing radiation dose, no significant correlation was found for all cancers combined. For site-specific cancers, most cancers including leukemia showed no positive correlation with dose, except for cancers of the esophagus, stomach and rectum and multiple myeloma. External causes showed a significant correlation with dose. A separate questionnaire study indicated that these positive findings could be ascribed in part to lifestyle characteristics of the workers. For leukemia only, we attempted to estimate the excess relative risk per unit dose of radiation, which, with reservations because of its wide confidence interval, was within the range of variation of the risks reported in other radiation epidemiological studies. This population must be studied for a longer time and with a consideration of the possible effects of confounding factors.","['Iwasaki, Tamiko', 'Murata, Motoi', 'Ohshima, Sumio', 'Miyake, Toshio', 'Kudo, Shin-ichi', 'Inoue, Yasushi', 'Narita, Minoru', 'Yoshimura, Takesumi', 'Akiba, Suminori', 'Tango, Toshiro', 'Yoshimoto, Yasuhiko', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Sobue, Tomotaka', 'Kusumi, Shizuyo', 'Yamagishi, Chikao', 'Matsudaira, Hiromichi']","['Iwasaki T', 'Murata M', 'Ohshima S', 'Miyake T', 'Kudo S', 'Inoue Y', 'Narita M', 'Yoshimura T', 'Akiba S', 'Tango T', 'Yoshimoto Y', 'Shimizu Y', 'Sobue T', 'Kusumi S', 'Yamagishi C', 'Matsudaira H']","['Radiation Effects Association, Kajicho, Chiyodaku, Tokyo, 101-0044, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Cause of Death', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2003/01/23 04:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2003/01/23 04:00'],"['2003/01/23 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0228:saomon]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2003 Feb;159(2):228-38. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0228:saomon]2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An original method to encapsulate (99m)Tc-MIBI in PEG-liposomes is described. The (99m)Tc-MIBI-PEG-liposomes were compared with free (99m)Tc-MIBI with respect to (a) tumour availability (b) ability to distinguish between chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant cells and (c) uptake ratio in tumour imaging. PEG-liposomal systems composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG(2000)-distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and lissamine-rhodamine B-labelled liposomes were used. The encapsulation of (99m)Tc-MIBI in liposomes was achieved using the K(+) diffusion potential method. We compared the uptake of free versus encapsulated (99m)Tc-MIBI by sensitive and resistant erythroleukaemia (K562) and breast tumour (MCF-7ras) cells. To assess the internalisation of these liposomes into cells, rhodamine B-labelled PEG-liposomes were used and visualised by fluorescence microscopy. Biodistribution and imaging characteristics of encapsulated and free radiotracer were determined in rats and tumour-bearing nude mice. The efficiency of (99m)Tc-MIBI encapsulation in PEG-liposomes was 50+/-5%. Use of (99m)Tc-MIBI-PEG-liposomes did not impair the ability of this tracer to distinguish between chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant tumour cells; the percentage of radioactivity accumulated in the sensitive K562 cells was 1.24+/-0.04%, as compared with 0.41+/-0.04% in the resistant K562 cells. One hour post injection in rats, PEG-liposomes showed a ten times higher activity in blood than free (99m)Tc-MIBI, whereas activity of free (99m)Tc-MIBI in kidneys and bladder was markedly higher than that of encapsulated (99m)Tc-MIBI, indicating faster clearance of the free radiotracer. In the (MCF7-ras)-bearing nude mice, PEG-liposome uptake in tumour was two times that of free (99m)Tc-MIBI. Summarising, the (99m)Tc-MIBI-PEG-liposomes demonstrated a longer blood circulation time, enabled distinction between chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant cells and improved tumour to background contrast in in vivo imaging. (99m)Tc-MIBI-PEG-liposomes therefore show promising potential for tumour imaging.","['Belhaj-Tayeb, Hayet', 'Briane, Dominique', 'Vergote, Jackie', 'Kothan, Suchart', 'Leger, Gerard', 'Bendada, Saad-Eddine', 'Tofighi, Mojdeh', 'Tamgac, Feyzi', 'Cao, An', 'Moretti, Jean-Luc']","['Belhaj-Tayeb H', 'Briane D', 'Vergote J', 'Kothan S', 'Leger G', 'Bendada SE', 'Tofighi M', 'Tamgac F', 'Cao A', 'Moretti JL']","[""Laboratoire de radiopharmacologie et traitement de l'image, UPRES 2360, Universite de Paris Nord, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, 93017 Bobigny cedex, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Coated Materials, Biocompatible)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '971Z4W1S09 (Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coated Materials, Biocompatible/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Organ Specificity', '*Polyethylene Glycols', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole-Body Counting']",,2003/01/22 04:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2002/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-002-1038-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2003 Apr;30(4):502-9. doi: 10.1007/s00259-002-1038-4.

In all AML patients, antigen-presenting cells (APC) could be generated from leukaemic cells in 2 days by incubation with PMA or calcium ionophore (A23187 or ionomycin) in the presence as well as in the absence of IL-4. In 30 out of 36 patients APC could be generated after 2 weeks of culture in cytokine-enriched medium. AML-APC cultured with PMA or calcium ionophores immunophenotypically and functionally were at a more mature stage than those cultured in cytokine-enriched medium. The most mature APC were generated by calcium ionophore A23187 plus IL-4, as evidenced by the higher expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR. Autologous T cell mediated cytotoxicity towards AML blast cells in vitro was observed in 2 cases tested. The persistence of cytogenetic abnormalities confirmed the leukaemic origin of the AML-APC. The generation of AML-APC was possible from freshly isolated as well as cryopreserved material. Our data show that generation of sufficient AML-APC by A23187 plus IL-4 is feasible, for vaccination purposes, in approximately 70% of AML specimens, offering a time-saving and cost-effective approach in preparing anti-leukaemia vaccines.","['Westers, Theresia M', 'Stam, Anita G M', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Regelink, Johanna C', 'Nieuwint, Aggie W M', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J']","['Westers TM', 'Stam AG', 'Scheper RJ', 'Regelink JC', 'Nieuwint AW', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Ionophores)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/drug effects/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Preservation/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Vaccination']",,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2002/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-002-0316-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Jan;52(1):17-27. doi: 10.1007/s00262-002-0316-0.

The basic mechanism behind RNAi is the breaking of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) matching a specific gene sequence into short pieces called short interfering RNA, which trigger the degradation of mRNA that matches its sequence. In this study, we explored the effects of RNAi in reducing the target gene expression in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. METHODS: Four myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U937, THP-1, and K562) were transfected with dsRNA duplexes corresponding to the endogenous c-raf and bcl-2 genes and the gene expression inhibition was assessed. The effect of RNAi on cell differentiation was studied; the apoptosis induction and the sensitization of the leukemia cell lines to etoposide and daunorubicin were quantified by flowcytometric methods. RESULTS: Transfection of the myeloid leukemia cell lines with dsRNA corresponding to c-raf and bcl-2 genes decreased the expression of Raf-1 and Bcl-2 proteins. RNAi for c-raf gene blocked the appearance of the monocytic differentiation induced by treatment with TPA. Combined RNAi for c-raf and bcl-2 induced apoptosis in HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells and increased chemosensitivity to etoposide and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: RNAi is a functional pathway in human myeloid leukemia cell lines and combined RNAi of c-raf and bcl-2 genes may represent a novel approach to leukemia, providing a means to overcome the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and ultimately to augment the efficacy of chemotherapy in myeloid leukemia.","['Cioca, Daniel P', 'Aoki, Yuji', 'Kiyosawa, Kendo']","['Cioca DP', 'Aoki Y', 'Kiyosawa K']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan. dcioca@personal.ro']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2002/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700544 [doi]', '7700544 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2003 Feb;10(2):125-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700544.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of cyclin A1 was found in acute myeloid leukemia and cyclin A1 induced leukemia in a transgenic mouse model. We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to analyze cyclin A1 expression in solid tumors. Cyclin A1 expression was very low in breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and in cervical carcinoma. However, substantial expression of cyclin A1 was found in testicular and ovarian cancer and in endometrial cancer. In testis specimens, cyclin A1 expression was much higher in testicular tumors compared to Sertoli cell only syndrome that lacks spermatogenesis. Compared to normal spermatogenesis, testicular cancers expressed on average lower levels of cyclin A1. Among the different histological subtypes of testicular tumors, embryonal cell carcinomas and immature teratomas expressed the highest levels of cyclin A1. The cyclin A1 levels in these tumors were similar to those seen in normal testis. Seminomas and yolk sac tumors expressed intermediate levels, whereas cyclin A1 expression was very low in mature teratomas. These findings indicate that cyclin A1 is expressed in selected solid tumors.

A serious complication of treatment with nitrogen mustards is the increased risk of a secondary leukaemia in long-term survivors because not all alkylating agent interactions with DNA result in cell death. In an earlier study 2'-deoxy-5'-mononucleotide/melphalan adducts have been analysed by us by LC-ES MSMS. In this work we want to present the first results of the analysis of the corresponding 2'-deoxynucleoside/melphalan adducts from DNA hydrolysates by column switching/capillary LC-ES tandem mass spectrometry. Nucleosides, compared to nucleotides, give better chromatographic results and show a good sensitivity under electrospray (+) [ES(+)] ionisation. Several adducts were identified under ES(+) conditions. Mono-alkylated nucleoside adducts alkylated at the base moiety were identified for dGuo, dCyd and dAdo. Structures were identified by recording the low-energy CAD product ion scans. Also a mono-alkylated nucleotide pdA with alkylation position at the phosphate moiety could be detected. This proves that in the case of phosphate alkylation the enzymatic dephosphorylation reaction was inhibited. A Jurkat cell suspension was treated with melphalan (1 mM) and incubated at 37 degrees C (5% CO(2)). After 6 and 48 h, the DNA was isolated and enzymatically hydrolysed. The corresponding nucleoside pool was evaluated with the developed LC-MS method. In the 48-h experiment, one adduct could be identified as a N-7 alkylated dGuo. In the 6-h experiment, no adducts could be found. Additional experiments were done wherein Jurkat-DNA, isolated from a non-treated cell culture, was treated with melphalan. These results were analogous with the data found in melphalan-treated calf thymus DNA. Additionally, we tried to determine the exact alkylation position by interpreting high-resolution fragmentation spectra.","['Van den Driessche, Bart', 'Lemiere, Filip', 'Van Dongen, Walter', 'Esmans, Eddy L']","['Van den Driessche B', 'Lemiere F', 'Van Dongen W', 'Esmans EL']","['Department of Chemistry, Nucleoside Research and Mass Spectrometry Unit, University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

Here we report the cloning of a novel human cystatin-like molecule (CLM) from human bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) cDNA library. The putative CLM protein contained 159 residues with a 29-residue signal peptide. CLM protein was highly homologous to family 2 cystatins, especially mouse and human testatin. The CLM gene spanned two exons and was mapped on chromosome 20p11.2, among cystatin superfamily gene clusters. CLM mRNA was barely detected in most tumor cell lines except for breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and glioblastoma U251 cells, but after LPS or PMA stimulation, CLM expression was increased in myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U-937. Northern blot analysis revealed CLM was ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, which was clearly different from the testis-specific expression pattern of most family 2 cystatins. When overexpressed in 293 cells, GFP-fused CLM targeted extracellularly through secretory pathway by Golgi apparatus. The results indicated that the secreted CLM protein might play roles in hematopoietic differentiation or inflammation.","['Sun, Hongying', 'Li, Nan', 'Wang, Xiaojian', 'Liu, Shuxun', 'Chen, Taoyong', 'Zhang, Lihuang', 'Wan, Tao', 'Cao, Xuetao']","['Sun H', 'Li N', 'Wang X', 'Liu S', 'Chen T', 'Zhang L', 'Wan T', 'Cao X']","['Institute of Immunology, Zhejiang University, 353 Yanan Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310031, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CST9 protein, human)', '0 (Cystatins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cystatins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/04/05 05:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02029856 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02985-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jan 31;301(1):176-82. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02985-6.,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF494536'],,,,,

Most of the patients are asymptomatic. Thus, it is far less dramatic than advanced disease and may require different treatment strategies. For these patients, it is not clear whether it is better to start chemotherapy right after the diagnosis or to delay the treatment until symptoms become obvious as the disease progresses. OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesize all available research evidence on whether early treatment intervention results in improved clinical outcomes when compared with observation alone. The main outcomes of interest that were examined included mortality, disease progression, response rate, and toxicity of early treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the following electronic databases were undertaken: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, LILLIACS and Cochrane Database of RCTs. We have recently compiled a comprehensive database of RCTs in myeloma. This search was updated and supplemented by hand-search of abstracts from main society meetings such as the ASH (American Society of Hematology), ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), and EHA (European Haematology Association). In addition, we compared our list with a list of RCTs maintained by the Oxford Clinical Trial Service Unit. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) with a parallel design that compared early versus deferred treatment of patients with early stage multiple myeloma based on Durie-Salmon (D-S) staging system. We also considered those trials that did not define early stage myeloma according to D-S staging system, but enrolled patients according to clinical uncertainty about the benefits of immediate intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data synthesis was performed for all studies and according to the defined quality criteria. The first reviewer and the contact reviewer of this proposal independently extracted data. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Revman software (ver 4.1) was used to combine results from all studies and expressed as an overall odds ratio or Peto's Odds Ratio, with 95% confidence interval. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials were included with a total of 131 patients in each of the early treatment and deferred treatment groups. Early MM is asymptomatic stage I in these trials. All trials used standard Melphalan treatment but not stem cell transplantation. No statistically significant heterogeneity among the studies was detected. Beneficial effects of early treatment were seen in delay of myeloma progression (Peto's OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29), and reduced vertebral compression (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.02-1.59, NNT = 23, 95% CI: an NNT of 11, via infinity, to an NNH of 50). No significant effects on mortality and response rate were seen (Peto's OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.67-1.84, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.33-1.23, respectively). Early treatment may increase the risk of acute leukemia (Peto's OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 0.55-18.73, NNH = 44, 95% CI: an NNT of 63, via infinity, to an NNH of 15). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment of early stage multiple myeloma inhibits disease progression, and may reduce vertebral compression. However, early treatment may increase the risk of acute leukemia. However, the data on vertebral compression and leukaemic transformation may not be interpretable due to very small numbers. Based on the current evidence, mortality and response rate are not significantly affected by introducing early treatment in the progression of myeloma. However, it is quite possible that the lack of beneficial effects of early intervention in myeloma is a false negative result due to the paucity of the existing evidence. In addition, data on quality of life and toxicity were sparsely reported adding to additional difficulties about management decisions in early stage myeloma.","['He, Y', 'Wheatley, K', 'Clark, O', 'Glasmacher, A', 'Ross, H', 'Djulbegovic, B']","['He Y', 'Wheatley K', 'Clark O', 'Glasmacher A', 'Ross H', 'Djulbegovic B']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Time Factors']",PMC6485476,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/03/28 05:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD004023 [doi]'],ppublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(1):CD004023. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD004023.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biol. Chem. 274, 29294-29302; Nomura, Imai, Koumura, Kobayashi and Nakagawa (2000) Biochem. J. 351, 183-193]. The present study shows the involvement of peroxidation of CL in the inactivation of adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and the opening of permeability transition pores by using the system of ANT-reconstituted liposome and isolated mitochondria. ANT activity appeared in dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine proteoliposome containing 10% (mol/mol) CL or phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but not other classes of phospholipids. ANT activity was competitively inhibited by the addition of cardiolipin hydroperoxide (CLOOH) in reconstituted liposomes containing CL. However, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide failed to inactivate the activity of ANT. The activity of ANT in reconstituted liposomes, including CLOOH, recovered when CLOOH in reconstituted liposome was reduced to hydroxycardiolipin by incubation with PHGPx. The activity of ANT was determined in rat basophil leukaemia RBL2H3 cells after their exposure to 2-deoxyglucose. ANT activity decreased to 50% of the control level by 4 h in response to apoptosis. In parallel, cyt c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were released from mitochondria. Suppression of the accumulation of CLOOH by overexpression of PHGPx in mitochondria effectively prevented the inactivation of ANT, the opening of permeability transition pores and the release of cyt c and AIF from mitochondria in hypoglycaemia-induced apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that mitochondrial PHGPx might be involved in the modulation of the activity of ANT and the opening of pores for the release of cyt c via the modulation of levels of CLOOH in the mitochondria.","['Imai, Hirotaka', 'Koumura, Tomoko', 'Nakajima, Ryo', 'Nomura, Kazuhiro', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito']","['Imai H', 'Koumura T', 'Nakajima R', 'Nomura K', 'Nakagawa Y']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '9068-80-8 (Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases)', 'EC 1.11.1.12 (Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Hypoglycemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Rats']",PMC1223322,2003/01/22 04:00,2003/05/29 05:00,['2003/01/22 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20021342 [doi]', 'BJ20021342 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2003 May 1;371(Pt 3):799-809. doi: 10.1042/BJ20021342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA blot hybridization analysis using the cDNA inserts as probes revealed that BC3H1 cells produce MuLV-related transcirpts of at least three different size classes. A polymerase chain reaction enhanced assay for reverse transcriptase activity revealed the presence of reverse transcriptase in a viral pellet from medium conditioned by BC3H1 cells. A fungizone enhanced assay for syncitium formation provided further evidence of ecotropic retroviral particle production. Exposure of 3T3 cells to medium conditioned by BC3H1 cells, using conditions that facilitate infection, resulted in infection of the 3T3 cells, as confirmed by the syncitium formation assay. We conclude that BC3H1 cells produce an infectious ecotropic murine leukemia virus. Whether or not this feature of BC3H1 cells contributes to their inability to express some muscle-specific genes or to carry out myotube formation is unknown. Investigators will want to take into account that BC3H1 cells are virus producers when planning experiments that involve coculture of BC3H1 with other cell types, BC3H1 conditioned medium, retrovirally mediated transfection into BC3H1 cells, or study of the mCAT-1 amino acid transporter (the viral receptor) in BC3H1 cells.

The growth of HL-60 and NB4 cells was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. The apoptosis was measured by light microscopy, flow cytometry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. The effect of LaCl(3) on normal bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells was evaluated by colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) assay. Under our experimental conditions, MTT assay showed that 48-h treatment with 1, 2, and 3 mM LaCl(3) or 48- and 72-h treatments with 1 mM LaCl(3) could significantly inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells. Treatment with 2 and 4 mM CeCl(3) for 72 h could significantly inhibit the growth of NB4 cells. Apoptosis could be detected on treatment with 2 mM LaCl(3) for 24 h in HL-60 cells by light microscopic morphology examination, flow cytometric analysis, and TUNEL method. Apoptosis could be also detected on treatment with 2 mM CeCl(3) for 72 h in NB4 cells. Treatment with 1 mM LaCl(3) could arrest the transitions from G0/G1 to S phase. The granulocyte-macrophage colony formation of normal bone marrow cells was not significantly inhibited at lower concentrations of LaCl(3) (0.5 to 2 mM). Our results indicate that at certain concentrations, the rare earth compounds may inhibit the growth of leukemic cells, induce them to apoptosis, and have no significant inhibitory effects on normal bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM).

Three of the systems include amotosalen [S 59] as the inactivation compound. Amotosalen is a light-activated, DNA-, RNA-crosslinking psoralen compound, which is used to neutralise pathogens. The systems that utilise amotosalen are called the INTERCEPT Platelet System, the INTERCEPT Plasma System and the Allogeneic Cellular Immunotherapies (ACIT) system. The INTERCEPT Platelet System and INTERCEPT Plasma System are two of the systems that make up Cerus' INTERCEPT Blood Systems. The other system is the INTERCEPT Red Blood Cell System, which contains S 303 as the inactivation compound rather than amotosalen. Cerus' Helinx technology is able to prevent replication of DNA or RNA that is present in pathogens but not in the blood components being treated (e.g. platelets and plasma). When added to the blood components, the inactivation agent (in this case amotosalen) crosses the membrane or cell wall of the pathogen. When activated by light, amotosalen binds to the nucleic acid of the pathogen and prevents replication. This process prevents infection. INTERCEPT Platelet System: Cerus developed its INTERCEPT Platelet System, in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare, for use in blood centres. Platelets are an essential component of the coagulation process and may be required by patients undergoing surgery, cancer chemotherapy, transplantation or with bleeding disorders. The system is made up of an illuminator device, a compound absorption device and a processing kit containing amotosalen. In October 2002, the two companies announced that CE Mark approval had been received for the illuminator device for the INTERCEPT trade mark Blood System. Application of this technology to platelets is the first to be approved. As it is a new technology, the system is currently undergoing process validation in accordance with European Blood Bank GMP requirements. This validation process is currently being conducted in Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden and the UK. Marketing approval applications for the INTERCEPT Platelet System have also been submitted in Australia and Canada. In addition, the regulatory submission process has begun in the US. A phase III trial (EuroSPRITE) has been conducted in 103 patients in Europe with pooled random donor platelets. The platelets were collected using the buffy coat process. Another two 20-patient clinical trials have also been conducted in Europe, as well as a 40-patient trial using platelets collected by an apheresis collection system. Cerus has also conducted a phase III trial (SPRINT) in the US. The trial was conducted in 671 patients and used platelets collected by Baxter's apheresis collection system. INTERCEPT Plasma System: Cerus is also developing the INTERCEPT Plasma System in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare. The system also combines amotosalen, an illumination device and a compound absorption device. The two companies are currently preparing regulatory applications for the INTERCEPT Plasma System for the US. This application will be followed by a submission for CE Mark designation in Europe. Patients undergoing surgery, or transplantation, or with bleeding disorders, may require transfusions of plasma, often to control bleeding. The type of plasma is stored in frozen form and is called fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The INTERCEPT Plasma System is currently in phase IIIc development in the US. Patient enrolment in the trial is still ongoing. The trial is comparing INTERCEPT trade mark Plasma System treated versus untreated FFP in 30 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Allogeneic Cellular Immunotherapies system: Cerus is also investigating the potential of its Helinx technology to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation procedures (used to treat leukaemia and lymphoma) through the treatmatment for many forms of leukaemia and is most effective when the donor is very closely matched to the patient for the major human leucocyte antigen (HLA) groups. As part of the transplant procedure, patients receive donor T cells to improve engraftment of the bone marrow transplant and strengthen the patient's immune system. However, donor T cells expose the patient to a high risk of contracting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by the proliferation of donor T cells, which attack the patient's healthy tissue. GVHD has a high mortality rate. Cerus' ACIT system has been developed to decrease the stringency of matching donors to patients and to inhibit the ability of donor T cells to cause GVHD. Light-activated amotosalen binds and permanently crosslinks DNA, preventing replication and thus stopping proliferation of donor T cells. Phase I development is currently being conducted in this area in the US using amotosalen as the neutralising agent. Cerus completed a phase I study investigating the safety and tolerability of its ACIT system in 2001. The study was conducted in patients receiving closely matched allogeneic bone marrow transplants for leukaemia. The company is currently collaborating with the National Marrow Donor Program in order to conduct further clinical studies in patients receiving bone marrow transplants from unmatched donors. Cerus has development, manufacturing and marketing agreements with Baxter covering the INTERCEPT Blood Systems, which includes the INTERCEPT Platelet system, the INTERCEPT Plasma System, and the INTERCEPT Red Blood Cell System. Under the terms of the agreements the two companies usually share the very early development activities. Cerus then conducts preclinical and clinical trials, while Baxter is responsible for the development of the systems disposables and devices. Following commercialisation Cerus will supply amotosalen and Baxter will supply the other components of the system and market, sell and distribute the system In January 2001, Cereus announced that it has entered into a collaborative agreement with the Pharmaceutical Division of Kirin Brewery in Japan to develop and market products for stem cell transplantation based on Cerus' proprietary Helinx technology. Under terms of the agreement, Cerus and Kirin will jointly develop the products. Cerus has received an initial license fee of US dollar 1 million. In addition it may receive up to US dollar 11 million in future payments upon achievement of development milestones. Kirin will also fund all development expenses for the Asia-Pacific region and a portion of Cerus' development activities aimed at obtaining product approval in the US. Kirin will market the products in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, China, Korea and Australia, and Cerus will receive a specified share of product revenues.

Although this phenomenon is well described morphologically, molecular data concerning the relationship of the two lesions are lacking. The aim of the study was to investigate the clonal relationship of discordant lymphoma manifestations by using immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH), as well as bcl-2 rearrangements, as molecular markers. IgH rearrangements were amplified by PCR with consensus primers directed against framework regions 3 or 2 (FR3 and FR2), followed by automated fragment length analysis and sequencing in selected cases. Rearrangements of the bcl-2 gene were identified with primers against the major breakpoint region. Small BM infiltrates were isolated by laser capture microdissection. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections using antibodies against CD3, CD10, CD20, bcl-2, bcl-6, p53, and the Ki67 antigen. Paraffin-embedded tissues of 21 cases diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with discordant BM involvement and no previous history of low-grade B-cell NHL were analyzed. After review of immunohistochemical stains, 5 cases were excluded either as concordant BM infiltrates by large-cell lymphoma with abundant reactive T-cells (2 cases) or as benign, reactive lymphoid infiltrates (3 cases), as confirmed by a polyclonal pattern in the IgH analysis. Of the remaining 16 cases, a common clonal origin was confirmed in 8 cases by the presence of an identical clonal IgH rearrangement or bcl-2 rearrangement. In 4 cases, identification of distinct IgH or bcl-2 rearrangements gave evidence for the presence of two clonally unrelated neoplasms. The remaining 4 cases were not evaluable for technical reasons. Morphological, phenotypical, and molecular findings were compatible with a lymphoma of germinal center origin in the majority of cases. However, in 4 cases, flow cytometric analysis of the BM infiltrates revealed a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia phenotype. Two of these cases were clonally related to the DLBCL and thus represented Richter's transformation. In summary, discordant BM infiltrates in DLBCL represent a heterogeneous group of disorders, encompassing cases with a clonally related, clinically occult small-cell component, as well as cases with two clonally distinct, unrelated B-cell neoplasms presenting synchronously at different locations.","['Kremer, Marcus', 'Spitzer, Martin', 'Mandl-Weber, Sonja', 'Stecker, Katrin', 'Schmidt, Burkhard', 'Hofler, Heinz', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Fend, Falko']","['Kremer M', 'Spitzer M', 'Mandl-Weber S', 'Stecker K', 'Schmidt B', 'Hofler H', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Fend F']","['Institutes of Pathology, Technical University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2003/01/21 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/21 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.lab.0000050762.61660.27 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Invest. 2003 Jan;83(1):107-14. doi: 10.1097/01.lab.0000050762.61660.27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated synergistic induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells exposed to the potent differentiation-inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in conjunction with FP [L. Cartee et al., Cancer Res., 61: 2583-2591, 2001]. Although bryostatin 1 (10 nM) is a very weak inducer of differentiation compared with PMA in these cells, coadministration of a minimally toxic concentration of FP (100 nM) did not promote bryostatin 1-related maturation but instead caused a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c release; loss of Deltapsi(m)), caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and apoptosis. Bryostatin 1/FP-induced apoptosis was significantly diminished in cells ectopically expressing dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain or by coadministration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha soluble receptors, implicating the extrinsic pathway in bryostatin 1/FP actions. Enhanced apoptosis in bryostatin 1/FP-treated cells was accompanied by down-regulation of Mcl-1 and a sustained increase in TNF-alpha release. The selective protein kinase C inhibitor GFX blocked TNF-alpha and cytochrome c release in bryostatin 1/FP-treated cells and attenuated apoptosis. Finally, coadministration of bryostatin 1 (or PMA) with FP induced a marked increase in apoptosis in U937 cells ectopically expressing an NH(2)-terminal phosphorylation loop-deleted Bcl-2 protein, which are otherwise highly resistant to FP-mediated lethality. Taken together, these findings suggest that synergistic induction of apoptosis by bryostatin 1 and FP does not stem from disruption of the leukemic cell maturation process but instead results from enhanced release of TNF-alpha and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade, culminating in cell death.","['Cartee, Leanne', 'Maggio, Sonia C', 'Smith, Rebecca', 'Sankala, Heidi M', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Cartee L', 'Maggio SC', 'Smith R', 'Sankala HM', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 63573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA 90194-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/01/21 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/01/21 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/21 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Jan;2(1):83-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise, recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that E2F1 leads to transcriptional repression of Mcl-1 and subsequently apoptosis. Given the ability of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 antagonists to kill transformed cells, we surmised that flavopiridol may stabilize E2F1 and enhance apoptosis via repression of Mcl-1. Here we demonstrate that flavopiridol is associated with a dose-dependent increase in E2F1 protein levels, a corresponding reduction in Mcl-1, and apoptosis in H1299 lung carcinoma cells. Treatment of H1299 cells with 200 nM flavopiridol resulted in the rapid elevation of E2F1 and reduction in Mcl-1 levels within 12 h of treatment. The elevation of E2F1 and reduction in Mcl-1 clearly preceded the induction of apoptosis. Both H1299 and NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines that constitutively express Mcl-1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter have no reductions in Mcl-1 levels with flavopiridol treatment and are resistant to apoptosis induced by flavopiridol. H1299 cells that have E2F1 deleted through RNAi vector targeting are less sensitive to flavopiridol-induced cell death, and likewise, mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines deficient in E2F1 are less susceptible to apoptosis induced by flavopiridol compared with wild-type control fibroblasts. These data suggest that apoptosis induced by flavopiridol is dependent on the enhancement of E2F1 levels and the repression of Mcl-1.","['Ma, Yihong', 'Cress, W Douglas', 'Haura, Eric B']","['Ma Y', 'Cress WD', 'Haura EB']","['Experimental Therapeutics Programs, H.

For the development of more effective and less toxic retinoids, gene expression analyses using DNA microarrays have the potential to supplement conventional screening methods, which are based on the changes in cell morphology and/or function. In this study, we applied the class prediction algorithm, which was used in the molecular phenotyping of tumors, for the classification of synthetic retinoids (Am80 and Tp80) and retinoid synergists (HX630, TZ335, and PA024) as all-trans retinoic acid-like, 9-cis retinoic acid-like, and control-like classes. By analyzing the effects of all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid on the gene expressions in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, we successfully selected 50 marker genes whose expression pattern could distinguish these classes. Moreover, the classification revealed the existence of two subclasses among the retinoid synergists used with Am80. Close inspection of the DNA microarray analyses indicated that these two subclasses had different effects on the apoptosis of HL60 cells, and this was confirmed by in vivo experiments. These results indicate that the retinoidal activity of Am80, which has already been used in clinical trials, could be modulated differently by the two classes of retinoid synergists. Thus, these two subclasses of retinoid synergists have the potency to widen the usage of Am80. Our analyses demonstrated that the gene expression profiling could provide important information for developing useful retinoid synergists by compensating conventional screening methods.","['Ishida, Seiichi', 'Shigemoto-Mogami, Yukari', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Shudo, Koichi', 'Ozawa, Shogo', 'Sawada, Jun-Ichi', 'Ohno, Yasuo', 'Inoue, Kazuhide']","['Ishida S', 'Shigemoto-Mogami Y', 'Kagechika H', 'Shudo K', 'Ozawa S', 'Sawada J', 'Ohno Y', 'Inoue K']","['Divisions of Pharmacology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Setagaya, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan. ishida@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Retinoids)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Markers', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Retinoids/classification/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2003/01/21 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/01/21 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/21 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Jan;2(1):49-58.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous biochemical studies indicated the incorporation of Ara-C into DNA reduced the catalytic activity of human topoisomerase I by decreasing the rate of single DNA strand religation by the enzyme by 2-3-fold. We present the 3.1 A crystal structure of human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with an oligonucleotide containing Ara-C at the +1 position of the non-scissile DNA strand. The structure reveals that a hydrogen bond formed between the 2'-hydroxyl of Ara-C and the O4' of the adjacent -1 base 5' to the damage site stabilizes a C3'-endo pucker in the Ara-C arabinose ring. The structural distortions at the site of damage are translated across the DNA double helix to the active site of human topoisomerase I. The free sulfhydryl at the 5'-end of the nicked DNA strand in this trapped covalent complex is shifted out of alignment with the 3'-phosphotyrosine linkage at the catalytic tyrosine 723 residue, producing a geometry not optimal for religation. The subtle structural changes caused by the presence of Ara-C in the DNA duplex may contribute to the cytotoxicity of this leukemia drug by prolonging the lifetime of the covalent human topoisomerase I-DNA complex.","['Chrencik, Jill E', 'Burgin, Alex B', 'Pommier, Yves', 'Stewart, Lance', 'Redinbo, Matthew R']","['Chrencik JE', 'Burgin AB', 'Pommier Y', 'Stewart L', 'Redinbo MR']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography', 'Cytarabine/*chemistry', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*chemistry', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects']",,2003/01/21 04:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/01/21 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212930200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64844-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 4;278(14):12461-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212930200.

We studied the responses of okadaic acid (OKA)-treated K562 leukemia cells to crosslinking of membrane microdomains. Although OKA alone induced clustering of surface-bound F-actin, addition of a biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol) derivative of cholesterol (bPEG-Chol) and subsequent binding of streptavidin (SA) further induced accumulation of the clusters, resulting in the formation of a spherical cell extrusion. This extrusion was also induced by direct crosslinking of a raft marker, CD59, and ganglioside GM1. In addition, we found that knockout of the gene encoding Fyn kinase inhibited formation of the spherical extrusion in murine T-cells. In bPEG-Chol/SA-treated cells, CD59, ganglioside GM1, and clathrin/AP-2 were all accumulated on the surface of the actin-rich extrusion, whereas dynamin and transferrin receptors were unaffected.

ATO can degrade chimeric PML-RAR proteins and induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, its effects on primary hematopoietic CD34+ have not been examined. In this study, we compared the effects of ATO on HL60 leukemic cells and primary umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells. HL60 cells and UCB CD34+ cells were cultured with different concentrations of ATO for up to three weeks and examined for changes of cell cycle. We found that ATO (< or = 5 microM) caused prolongation of G1/S and G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of cells in G2/M increased significantly (from 8.6 to 53.8%). High-dose ATO (> or = 25 microM) caused non-specific cell death in HL60 cells without any changes in cell cycle. In contrast to HL60 cells, UCB CD34+ cells were more resistant to high-dose ATO and most ATO-resistant CD34+ cells remained in G0/G1 phase. Primary cells that were resistant to ATO were rich in CD34+ cells. We further show that the ATO resistance was not related to the expression of P-glycoprotein (MDR-1). Our results suggest that the resistance to ATO in primitive UCB CD34+ cells is most likely related to its cell-cycle status. These results could be useful to design treatments for non-APL malignancies and to enrich hematopoietic stem cells in clinically applicable settings.","['Huang, Ming-Jer', 'Hsieh, Ruey-Kuen', 'Lin, Che-Pin', 'Chang, Ian Y', 'Liu, Hsing-Jin']","['Huang MJ', 'Hsieh RK', 'Lin CP', 'Chang IY', 'Liu HJ']","['Department of Hemato-oncology, Taipei Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",,2003/01/21 04:00,2003/07/10 05:00,['2003/01/21 04:00'],"['2003/01/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000032980 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Nov;43(11):2191-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000032980.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study we evaluated the effect of chemotherapy on Bcl-2 cleavage in B lineage leukemic cell lines. JM-1, SUP-B 15 and RS4 leukemic cell lines cleaved Bcl-2 to its 23 kDa form when exposed to the chemotherapeutic agents 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (Ara-C) or etoposide (VP-16). Chemotherapy induced Bcl-2 cleavage was blunted by inhibition of caspase activity. Co-culture of leukemic cells with bone marrow stromal cells during chemotherapy exposure resulted in reduced levels of 23 kDa Bcl-2 protein.

Treatment failure, particularly in AML, is mostly related to the problem of resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs and the morbidity and mortality associated with intensive chemotherapy. Thus, a significant challenge that remains is to develop novel therapeutic strategies that would ideally be able to address these issues. Novel immune approaches to cancer immunotherapy, while promising for specificity and long-term protection as single therapies, have not typically proven potent enough to generate long-lasting therapeutic responses.

The Notch pathway is intact in a majority of B-lymphoma cell lines, but EBNA2, which mimics notch function, can occasionally activate the pathway.

Using various animal models for autoimmune diseases, we have previously found that allogeneic (not autologous) bone marrow transplantation can be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytic purpura, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic glomerulonephritis and certain types of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In contrast, we have found that the transplantation of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells or partially purified hemopoietic stem cells from autoimmune-prone mice to normal mice leads to the induction of autoimmune diseases in the recipients. These findings have recently been confirmed even in humans; autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease were resolved after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, there have recently been reports on the rapid recurrence or persistence of autoimmune diseases after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Conversely, the adoptive transfer of autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Graves' disease by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from donors to recipients has been reported. Owing to these findings, we have proposed that autoimmune diseases are ""stem cell disorders."" We have thus succeeded in treating autoimmune diseases in various autoimmune-prone mice, except MRL/lpr mice, by conventional bone marrow transplantation. The MRL/lpr mouse itself is radiosensitive (<8.5 Gy), while the abnormal hemopoietic stem cells of the MRL/lpr mouse are radioresistant (>8.5 Gy); conventional bone marrow transplantation (8.5 Gy plus bone marrow transplantation) has a transient effect on autoimmune diseases, which recur three months after the bone marrow transplantation. However, bone marrow transplantation plus bone grafts (to recruit donor stromal cells) completely prevents the recurrence of autoimmune diseases in MRL/lpr mice. Donor-derived stromal cells (including mesenchymal stem cells) thus seem to play a crucial role in successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, since there is a major histocompatibility complex restriction between hemopoietic stem cells and stromal cells. We have, however, found that the combination of bone marrow transplantation plus bone grafts has no effect on the treatment of autoimmune diseases in MRL/lpr mice, since MRL/lpr mice become more radiosensitive after the onset of lupus nephritis due to the development of uremic enterocolitis. To reduce the cytotoxic effect of radiation on the intestine, we carried out fractionated irradiation and devised a new strategy. We injected allogeneic whole bone marrow cells (including a small number [<3%] of T cells, hemopoietic stem cells and stromal cells) from donors directly into the intra-bone marrow of recipients so that donor-derived hemopoietic cells including stromal cells could effectively accumulate in the bone marrow. All the MRL/lpr mice survived more than one year (>60 weeks after birth) without the recurrence of autoimmune diseases, and immunological functions were completely restored even when the radiation dose was reduced to 5 Gy x 2. These findings suggest that intra-bone marrow injection-bone marrow transplantation can be used to treat intractable autoimmune diseases under reduced radiation doses without using any immunosuppressants.Intra-bone marrow injection-bone marrow transplantation seems to be the best strategy for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: 1) no graft-versus-host disease develops even if T cells are not depleted from the bone marrow; 2) no graft failure occurs even if the dose of radiation as the conditioning for bone marrow transplantation is reduced to 5 Gy x 2; 3) hemopoietic recovery is rapid; and 4) T-cell functions are completely restored even in donor-recipient combinations across the major histocompatibility complex barriers. Using cynomolgus monkeys, we have recently established a new method (the ""perfusion method"") for collecting bone marrow cells from the long bones (femur, humerus, etc.) without peripheral blood contamination. This method has various advantages: 1) no graft-versus-host disease develops even in cynomolgus monkeys, since the percentage of T cells in the bone marrow cells collected is less than 3%; 2) a large number of bone marrow cells can be collected quickly and safely; and 3) the bone marrow cells collected contain stromal cells including mesenchymal stem cells. We therefore believe that this method (intra-bone marrow injection-bone marrow transplantation in conjunction with the perfusion method) will become a powerful new strategy for not only allogeneic bone marrow transplantation but also organ transplantation in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, this method could become a valuable strategy in regeneration therapy for injured organs and tissues (myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, Alzheimer's disease, etc.), since it can efficiently reconstitute the recipient with both donor-derived hemopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells.","['Ikehara, Susumu']",['Ikehara S'],"['First Department of Pathology, Transplantation Center, Regeneration Research Center for Intractable Diseases, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi City, Osaka, Japan. ikehara@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/physiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['820106 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.2002.38.2.820106 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 2002 Feb;38(2):103-11. doi: 10.1358/dot.2002.38.2.820106.,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence to suggest that GVL and GVH are mediated by different clones of T cells. The objective of this study was to identify the two types of T cells based on their receptor sequences. To this end we used irradiated nonleukemic cells from recipients as stimulator cells in a primary mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). The activated CD4(+) donor T cells that expressed CD25 were purified by cell sorting. To prepare GVL-specific T cells, alloreactive T cells in the primary MLR were first depleted with an anti-CD25 immunotoxin. The remaining T cells had negligible alloreactivity in a secondary MLR. The allodepleted cells were then stimulated by using purified leukemia cells from the same individual as stimulator cells, and the CD25(+)-activated cells were purified by cell sorting. The GVL- and GVH-specific T cells were analyzed for their T cell receptor (TCR) clonality by using anchored RT-PCR of all the TCRbeta locus complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. By comparing TCRbeta CDR3 sequences from transformed bacterial colonies, we were able to demonstrate that T cells mediating GVH were different from those mediating GVL in each of the eight HLA-mismatched and one HLA-matched donor/recipient pairs.

Because the accumulation of superoxide (O(2)-) by inhibition of SOD depends on the cellular generation of O(2)-, we hypothesized that the endogenous production of superoxide may be a critical factor that affects the antileukemia activity of 2-ME. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cellular O(2)- contents and the cytotoxic activity of 2-ME in primary leukemia cells from 50 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Quantitation of O(2)- revealed that the basal cellular O(2)- contents are heterogeneous among patients with CLL. The O(2)- levels were significantly higher in CLL cells from patients with prior chemotherapy. CLL cells with higher basal O(2)- contents were more sensitive to 2-ME in vitro than those with lower O(2)- contents. There was a significant correlation between the 2-ME-induced O(2)- increase and the loss of cell viability. Importantly, addition of arsenic trioxide, a compound capable of causing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, significantly enhanced the activity of 2-ME, even in the CLL cells that were resistant to 2-ME alone. These results suggest that the cellular generation of O(2)- plays an important role in the cytotoxic action of 2-ME and that it is possible to use exogenous ROS-producing agents such as arsenic trioxide in combination with 2-ME to enhance the antileukemia activity and to overcome drug resistance. Such a combination strategy may have potential clinical applications.","['Zhou, Yan', 'Hileman, Elizabeth O', 'Plunkett, William', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Zhou Y', 'Hileman EO', 'Plunkett W', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

Failures are due to relapse, toxicity, and second cancers such as therapy-related myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia (t-ML). Topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylators can induce t-ML; additional risk factors for t-ML remain poorly defined. The occurrence of t-ML among children who had received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) following ALL remission induction therapy prompted us to examine this and other putative risk factors for t-ML in 412 children treated on 2 consecutive ALL protocols from 1991 to 1998. All children received etoposide and anthracyclines, 99 of whom received G-CSF; 284 also received cyclophosphamide, 58 of whom also received cranial irradiation. There were 20 children who developed t-ML at a median of 2.3 years (range, 1.0-6.0 years), including 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 3 myelodysplasia, and 1 chronic myeloid leukemia. Stratifying by protocol, the cumulative incidence functions differed (P =.017) according to the use of G-CSF and irradiation: 6-year cumulative incidence (standard error) of t-ML of 12.3% (5.3%) among the 44 children who received irradiation without G-CSF, 11.0% (3.5%) among the 85 children who received G-CSF but no irradiation, 7.1% (7.2%) among the 14 children who received irradiation plus G-CSF, and 2.7% (1.3%) among the 269 children who received neither irradiation nor G-CSF. Even when children receiving irradiation were excluded, the incidence was still higher in those receiving G-CSF (P =.019). In the setting of intensive antileukemic therapy, short-term use of G-CSF may increase the risk of t-ML.","['Relling, Mary V', 'Boyett, James M', 'Blanco, Javier G', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Kun, Larry E', 'Evans, William E', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Relling MV', 'Boyett JM', 'Blanco JG', 'Raimondi S', 'Behm FG', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Kun LE', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. mary.relling@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Placebos)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Placebos', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2405 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44430-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):3862-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2405.

In blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 2 classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop (7%-8% of patients). FLT3-ITD mutations are the most common molecular defect identified in AML and have been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival. FLT3-ITD is therefore an attractive molecular target for therapy. SU11248 is a recently described selective inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase domain RTKs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and KIT. We show that SU11248 also has potent activity against wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 activation loop (FLT3-Asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays. SU11248 inhibits FLT3-driven phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in vitro. In addition, SU11248 inhibits FLT3-induced VEGF production. The in vivo efficacy of SU11248 was investigated in 2 FLT3-ITD models: a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a bone marrow engraftment model. We show that SU11248 (20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses FLT3-ITD tumors in the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and prolongs survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits FLT3-ITD phosphorylation for up to 16 hours following a single dose. These results suggest that further exploration of SU11248 activity in AML patients is warranted.","[""O'Farrell, Anne-Marie"", 'Abrams, Tinya J', 'Yuen, Helene A', 'Ngai, Theresa J', 'Louie, Sharianne G', 'Yee, Kevin W H', 'Wong, Lily M', 'Hong, Weiru', 'Lee, Leslie B', 'Town, Ajia', 'Smolich, Beverly D', 'Manning, William C', 'Murray, Lesley J', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Cherrington, Julie M']","[""O'Farrell AM"", 'Abrams TJ', 'Yuen HA', 'Ngai TJ', 'Louie SG', 'Yee KW', 'Wong LM', 'Hong W', 'Lee LB', 'Town A', 'Smolich BD', 'Manning WC', 'Murray LJ', 'Heinrich MC', 'Cherrington JM']","['Preclinical Research and Exploratory Development, SUGEN, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. marie-ofarrell@sugen.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sunitinib', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2307 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50744-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3597-605. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2307.

However, ATO is also a potent inducer of apoptosis in a number of other cancer cells lacking the t(15:17) translocation. The exact mechanism of ATO-induced apoptosis in these cells is not yet clear. We tested the effect of ATO on 7 myeloma cell lines with varying p53 status and report that in cells with mutated p53, ATO induced rapid and extensive (more than 90%) apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner concomitant with arrest of cells in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Myeloma cells with wild-type (wt) p53 were relatively resistant to ATO with maximal apoptosis of about 40% concomitant with partial arrest of cells in G(1) and up-regulation of p21. The use of caspase blocking peptides, fluorescence-tagged caspase-specific substrate peptides, and Western immunoblotting confirmed the involvement of primarily caspase-8 and -3 in ATO-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells with mutated p53 and primarily caspase-9 and -3 in cells expressing wt p53. We also observed up-regulation by ATO of R1 and R2 APO2/TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptors. Most important, however, we observed a synergy between ATO and APO2/TRAIL in the induction of apoptosis in the partially resistant myeloma cell lines and in myeloma cells freshly isolated from myeloma patients. Our results justify the use of the combination of these 2 drugs in clinical setting in myeloma patients.","['Liu, Qun', 'Hilsenbeck, Susan', 'Gazitt, Yair']","['Liu Q', 'Hilsenbeck S', 'Gazitt Y']","['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3231 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44461-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4078-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3231.

We show that treatment of CLL cells with rolipram, a prototypic PDE4 inhibitor, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, induces mitochondrial depolarization, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, caspase-9 and -3 activation, and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)polymerase. Inhibitors of caspase-9, but not caspase-8, block rolipram/forskolin-induced CLL apoptosis. In a subset of CLL patients, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated death promoter homolog (Bad), a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that when phosphorylated on specific serine residues is sequestered in the cytosol by 14-3-3, was dephosphorylated at Ser112 following rolipram/forskolin treatment of leukemic cells. Rolipram/forskolin treatment also induced Bad to accumulate in CLL heavy-membrane fractions, consistent with Bad translocation to mitochondria. To determine the mechanism for rolipram/forskolin-induced Bad dephosphorylation, we examined CLL phosphatase activity. Rolipram/forskolin treatment augmented protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, as well as levels of immunoreactive PP2A catalytic subunit. Treatment of CLL cells with a concentration of okadaic acid (5 nM) that selectively inhibits PP2A, reduced both rolipram/forskolin-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarization. Okadaic acid restored Bad Ser112 phosphorylation and Bad association with 14-3-3 in rolipram/forskolin-treated CLL cells. These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may induce CLL apoptosis by activating PP2A-induced dephosphorylation of proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family members such as Bad.","['Moon, Eun-Yi', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Moon EY', 'Lerner A']","['Evans Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['CA79838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Diploidy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology/physiology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Rolipram/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3208 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44466-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4122-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3208.

Neonatal delivery would correct the disease sooner than would transfer into adults, and could reduce immunological responses. Neonatal mice were injected intravenously with a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector (RV) expressing canine FIX (cFIX). They achieved 150% to 280% of normal cFIX antigen levels in plasma (100% is 5 microg/mL), which was functional in vitro and in vivo. Three newborn hemophilia B dogs that were injected intravenously with RV achieved 12% to 36% of normal cFIX antigen levels, which improved coagulation tests. Only one mild bleed has occurred during 14 total months of evaluation. This is the first demonstration of prolonged expression after neonatal gene therapy for hemophilia B in mice or dogs. Most animals failed to make antibodies to cFIX, demonstrating that neonatal gene transfer may induce tolerance. Although hepatocytes from newborns replicate, those from adults do not. Adult mice therefore received hepatocyte growth factor to induce hepatocyte replication prior to intravenous injection of RV. This resulted in expression of 35% of normal cFIX antigen levels for 11 months, although all mice produced anti-cFIX antibodies. This is the first demonstration that high levels of FIX activity can be achieved with an RV in adults without a partial hepatectomy to induce hepatocyte replication. We conclude that RV-mediated hepatic gene therapy is effective for treating hemophilia B in mice and dogs, although the immune system may complicate gene transfer in adults.","['Xu, Lingfei', 'Gao, Cuihua', 'Sands, Mark S', 'Cai, Shi-Rong', 'Nichols, Timothy C', 'Bellinger, Dwight A', 'Raymer, Robin A', 'McCorquodale, Stephanie', 'Ponder, Katherine Parker']","['Xu L', 'Gao C', 'Sands MS', 'Cai SR', 'Nichols TC', 'Bellinger DA', 'Raymer RA', 'McCorquodale S', 'Ponder KP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['R24 HL063098/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48028/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK57586/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 HL63098/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibody Formation', 'Dogs', 'Factor IX/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemophilia B/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3050 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44440-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):3924-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3050.

The isolation of the SIL promoter provides an important tool for the study of both the SIL gene expression as well as the role of the SIL promoter in leukemogenesis.","['Colaizzo-Anas, Tina', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Colaizzo-Anas T', 'Aplan PD']","['Buffalo State-SUNY, 210 Caudell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14222, USA. tcolaizzo@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SIL protein, mouse)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/04/29 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0167478102005973 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(02)00597-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Jan 27;1625(2):207-13. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(02)00597-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEX1/hExo1 is expressed at low levels in a wide variety of tissues, but at higher levels in fetal liver and adult bone marrow, suggesting HEX1/hExo1 is important for hematopoietic stem cell development. A putative HEX1/hExo1 promoter fragment extending from -6240 to +1600bp exhibits cell-type specific activity in transient transfection assays. This fragment directs high luciferase reporter gene expression in the hematopoietic cell line K562, chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, but low luciferase expression in the non-hematopoietic cell line HeLa, human cervical carcinoma cells. Deletion studies identified a fragment spanning -688 to +1600bp that exhibits full transcriptional activity while a slightly shorter fragment from -658 to +1600bp exhibits significantly decreased promoter activity. In vitro binding assays revealed DNA-binding activities that interact with -687 to -681bp and -665 to -658bp elements. Oligonucleotide competition and antibody disruption studies determined that the transcription factor CREB-1 recognizes the -687 to -681bp element, while transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 recognize the -665 to -658bp element. Mutation of either the CREB-1 or Sp1/Sp3 binding sites dramatically reduces HEX1/hExo1 promoter activity and elimination of both elements abolishes promoter activity.","['Ladd, Paula D', 'Wilson, David M 3rd', 'Kelley, Mark R', 'Skalnik, David G']","['Ladd PD', 'Wilson DM 3rd', 'Kelley MR', 'Skalnik DG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 76643/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 03456/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 05865/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 38506/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.- (EXO1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1568786402001957 [pii]', '10.1016/s1568-7864(02)00195-7 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2003 Feb 3;2(2):187-98. doi: 10.1016/s1568-7864(02)00195-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We proposed that systems using processing and presentation of antigenic molecules from antigen-presenting cells primed with apoptotic bodies can offer new opportunities in anti-cancer treatment. We first established the technical conditions for purification, characterisation and production of tumour cells isolated from fresh pleural liquid or blood. Then we compared efficacy of different apoptotic inducers agents on the cancer cells in culture. The apoptotic tumour cells were purified, characterised and maintained in coculture with monocytes-derived immature dendritic cells. We subsequently investigated the effect of the maturation process on phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies. We have shown that whatever the nature of the apoptotic cells they are phagocytosed by the dendritic cells which were efficiently matured using the combination of TNFalpha+Poly I:C. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the generation of the mature dendritic cells pulsed with apoptotic tumour cells, successfully generated CD4(+) (Th1) and CD8(+) (CTL) cells.

We designed a trial of ATRA plus ara-C-based TST in an attempt to enhance drug-induced apoptosis and clinical outcome.

In addition, there was a positive relationship between the increase in the number of CD8-positive T-cells and the expression levels of these TCR transcripts. These findings suggest that CD8-positive T-cells monoclonally or oligoclonally expanded in the peripheral blood. We also determined the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCR alpha- and beta-chains of the expanded T-cells. Unique sequences were detected in a high percentage of the respective CDR3 clones. The gene segment of the variable and joining regions, however, varied among the patients. The deduced amino acid sequences of CDR3 were heterogeneous among the patients, and there was no common motif.

Here, we demonstrate that sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression in G, phase, through a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D3. Moreover, sulforaphane induced apoptosis (and also necrosis), mediated by an increase in the expression of p53. These findings suggest that sulforaphane is a growth modulator for T cells.

The studies were carried out in seven lymphoid cell lines: two mouse lymphoma L5178Y, the human pre-B cell leukemia Reh, and four human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cell lines (two apparently normal and two Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT)). We detected apoptosis with the in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay and flow cytometry, and measured the expression of several apoptotic-regulatory proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Bclx, NF kappa B) with Western blotting. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, comet assay as a measure of DNA damage, and trypan blue survival test were also done for comparison Although for the most of examined parameters of radiation sensitivity: i.e. micronucleus assay, trypan blue test and percentage of apoptosis--there were observed clear dose-effect relationships for all cell lines examined, we did not find agreement between values for these measured parameters. There are marked differences in both timing of apoptosis and percentage of apoptotic cells. Variation in the apoptotic fraction in the controls for different sets of experiments is not very pronounced. There is however considerable variation for the same parameters in irradiated cells, possibly due to their cell cycle status during irradiation, as the cultures were not synchronized. Overall, neither the numbers of apoptotic cells nor the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, nor DNA repair can serve as dose estimators or sensors for these lines, but still these parameters can give valuable supplementary information about radiation sensitivity.","['Jaworska, A', 'Wojewodzka, M', 'De Angelis, P']","['Jaworska A', 'Wojewodzka M', 'De Angelis P']","['Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, Postbox 55, N-1332 Oesteraas, Norway.

The HMW DNA fragmentation assay proved qualitative and quantitative sensitivity in following the progression of apoptosis in the patient's circulating population of leukemic blasts while, under the same circumstances, conventional cytometric parameters of apoptosis remained negative.","['Badran, A', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Ueda, T']","['Badran A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine1, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Sep-Oct;22(5):3025-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, ATPase has been shown to be involved in the apoptotic system, but its role is not fully understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of 8 species of ATPase inhibitors on actinomycin D plus colcemid-induced apoptosis in human megakaryoblastic leukemia CMK-7 cells by monitoring caspase-3 activation and DNA cleavage. RESULTS: 2,3-Butanedione monoxime (BDM), lansoprazole, cyclopiazonic acid, geldanamycin and radicicol suppressed the apoptosis. Among these compounds, geldanamycin was the strongest suppressor of both caspase-3 activation and DNA cleavage. Furthermore, Western blotting showed that radicicol suppressed the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 more strongly than BDM, lansoprazole or cyclopiazonic acid. CONCLUSION: Since geldanamycin and radicicol are specific inhibitors of the ATPase in HSP90, the present result implies that ATPase activity in HSP90 plays some role in this apoptosis.","['Shiono, Yoshihito', 'Fujita, Yasuko', 'Oka, Syuichi', 'Yamazaki, Yoshimitsu']","['Shiono Y', 'Fujita Y', 'Oka S', 'Yamazaki Y']","['Research Institute of Biological Resources, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0K5C5T2QPG (Lansoprazole)', '19SQ93LM6H (diacetylmonoxime)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'K324J5K4HM (Diacetyl)', 'KG60484QX9 (Omeprazole)', 'X9TLY4580Z (cyclopiazonic acid)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Diacetyl/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Lansoprazole', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Omeprazole/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Sep-Oct;22(5):2907-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity of Antoksyd S and baicalein in vitro was expressed as ED50 and compared with those of the cytostatics doxorubicin, cisplatin and DACA, under the same experimental conditions. Cell viability was determined by modified tetrazolium dye assay, using as a model cells with neoblastic phenotype (L1210). The antiradical activity of Antoksyd S and baicalin were investigated using the DPPH test in order to obtain their antioxidant characteristics. Structure- and concentration-dependent one electron bioactivations (peroxidative oxidation) of Antoksyd S and baicalin were performed in the absence or in the presence of GSH or SOD. It appears that Antoksyd S is a low toxic novel drug which could be effective in providing concentration-dependent antioxidative activity, acting as a cell proliferation modifier and, probably, as an apoptosis inducer in vitro, though this remains to be explored. These findings are discussed from a mechanistic standpoint as well as in terms of potential pharmacological applications under acute oxidative stress and apoptotic events. This work provides the basis for further investigations of Antoksyd S action in vitro and in vivo, since the presented results are indicative of its intracellular metabolic activation, which can only be partially associated with its observed action towards model cancer cells (mouse leukemia L1210).","['Ciesielska, Ewa', 'Gwardys, Antoni', 'Metodiewa, Diana']","['Ciesielska E', 'Gwardys A', 'Metodiewa D']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Lindleya 6, 90-131 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (antoksyd S)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '89459-43-8 (N-((2-dimethylamino)ethyl)-9-aminoacridine-4-carboxamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Scutellaria baicalensis/chemistry']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Sep-Oct;22(5):2885-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To understand the mechanism of beta 2m-induced apoptosis, we added purified human beta 2m to cultures of K562 human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells, detected apoptosis by DNA fragmentation and annexin V binding assays, measured mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m), and used Z-VAD-fmk, a general inhibitor of caspases, inhibitors of caspases-1 and-3, as well as Western blot analysis to detect activated caspases. RESULTS: beta 2m-induced apoptosis was associated with decreased delta psi m K562 cells. Treatment with the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, as well as the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD-CHO, significantly blocked beta 2m-induced apoptosis. However, Western blot analysis revealed that caspase-1 was intrinsically activated in untreated as well as beta 2m-treated K562 cells. Furthermore, beta 2m-induced apoptosis was not associated with the cleavage of caspase-3 as revealed by Western blot analysis, but was inhibited by an inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-DEVD-CHO, suggesting that not caspase-3, but a caspase-3-like enzyme may be involved in beta 2m-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis also revealed that caspases-4, -8 and -9 were not activated during beta 2m-induced apoptosis in these cells. CONCLUSION: These results reveal that beta 2m-induced apoptosis in K562 cells occurs by a mechanism dependent on decreased mitochondrial delta psi m. Moreover, while caspase-1 activity may be one of the factors involved in beta 2m-induced apoptosis, activation of this caspase alone does not cause apoptosis, and other proapoptotic factors including activation of a caspase-3-like enzyme, independently of caspases-4, -8 and -9 activity, may be required to trigger apoptosis.","['Wu, Ching-Huang', 'Gordon, John D', 'Zhong, Xiaoling', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Wu CH', 'Gordon JD', 'Zhong X', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Indiana University Cancer Center, 1044 West Walnut R4-119, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 80734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology/physiology']",,2003/01/18 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/18 04:00'],"['2003/01/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Sep-Oct;22(5):2613-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately one-half (49%, n = 81) of the participants returned the survey. Utility workers demonstrated greater levels of agreement with the current TLV standard in comparison to government, university, and other private sector workers. Utility workers were less likely to perceive that ACGIH guidelines should be changed to be made more strict. In addition, workers who had worked at their present job for 10 years or more indicated less agreement with the acceptability of ACGIH guidelines to protect workers' health. The scientists and other risk experts in this study illustrate the importance of how type of industry may influence perceptions of TLV effectiveness.","['McMahan, Shari', 'Lutz, Rafer', ""Meyer, Jon'a""]","['McMahan S', 'Lutz R', 'Meyer J']","['Division of Kinesiology and Health Promotion, California State University Fullerton, P.O.

An interphase FISH study on 63 patients.,255-9,"The translocation (14;18)(q32;q21) is the hallmark of follicular lymphoma (FL). However, conventional cytogenetics and PCR techniques fail to detect it in at least 10% of cases. In order to evaluate the true incidence of this translocation in FL, we analyzed 63 patients with FL, and 17 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) corresponding to suspected FL transformations using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Colocalized signals related to the translocation were observed in 19-92% of cells (median = 51%), corresponding to positivity over the threshold in all (63/63) cases. Similarly, 16/17 possibly secondary DLCL displayed the translocation. Although some cytogenetic changes might be missed by this FISH assay (such as rare insertion, or translocations with other chromosomal partners), our results stress t(14;18)(q32;q21) as an almost constant finding in FL. Our sensitive interphase FISH assay should be of great value to define FL more accurately, namely in patients included into therapeutic trials. Furthermore, this approach could be of interest in (re)defining some types of FL, especially the grade 3 FL which frequently lack t(14;18).","['Godon, A', 'Moreau, A', 'Talmant, P', 'Baranger-Papot, L', 'Genevieve, F', 'Milpied, N', 'Zandecki, M', 'Avet-Loiseau, H']","['Godon A', 'Moreau A', 'Talmant P', 'Baranger-Papot L', 'Genevieve F', 'Milpied N', 'Zandecki M', 'Avet-Loiseau H']","['Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'France', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Ploidies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402739 [doi]', '2402739 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):255-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402739.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of ex vivo purified plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled antisense ODNs resulted in a time- and dose-dependent uptake in the cytoplasm and nucleus. No major differences in uptake of Bcl-2 antisense ODNs were observed among patients' samples. Incubation of purified myeloma plasma cells with G3139, but not solvent or reverse polarity control ODNs, resulted in a reduction (>75%) of Bcl-2 mRNA levels after 2 and 4 days, as measured by Real-Time PCR. Treatment with G3139 led to a sequence-specific reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels within 4 days of exposure in 10 out of 11 clinical samples from patients with chemosensitive and multidrug-resistant disease, without significant reduction of alpha-Actin, Bax, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1 proteins. This resulted in a significantly enhanced sensitivity of the myeloma tumor cells to dexamethasone or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. G3139 can consistently enter myeloma cells, downregulate the expression of Bcl-2, and enhance the efficacy of myeloma therapy. These data support further clinical evaluation of G3139 therapy in multiple myeloma.","['van de Donk, N W C J', 'Kamphuis, M M J', 'van Dijk, M', 'Borst, H P E', 'Bloem, A C', 'Lokhorst, H M']","['van de Donk NW', 'Kamphuis MM', 'van Dijk M', 'Borst HP', 'Bloem AC', 'Lokhorst HM']","['Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)', 'VAD protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/adverse effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402768 [doi]', '2402768 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):211-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402768.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms that contribute to the multiple myeloma cell recruitment to the bone marrow microenvironment are not well understood. Chemokines play a central role for lymphocyte trafficking and homing. In this study we have investigated expression and functional importance of chemokine receptors in MM-derived cell lines and primary MM cells. We found that MM cell lines express functional CCR1, CXCR3 and CXCR4 receptors, and some also CCR6. Although only a minority of the cell lines responded by calcium mobilization after agonist stimulation, a migratory response to the CCR1 ligands RANTES and MIP-1 alpha was obtained in 5/6 and 4/6, respectively, of the cell lines tested. Five out of six cell lines showed a response to the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1. In addition, 3/6 cell lines migrated in response to MIP-3 alpha and IP-10, ligands for CCR6 and CXCR3, respectively. The expression of CXCR4 and CCR1 and the migration to their ligands, SDF-1, and RANTES and MIP-1 alpha, respectively, were also demonstrated in primary MM cells. These findings suggest that chemokine receptor expression and the migratory capacity of MM cells to their ligands are relevant for the compartmentalization of MM cells in the bone marrow.","['Moller, C', 'Stromberg, T', 'Juremalm, M', 'Nilsson, K', 'Nilsson, G']","['Moller C', 'Stromberg T', 'Juremalm M', 'Nilsson K', 'Nilsson G']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CCL5/pharmacology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2001/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402717 [doi]', '2402717 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):203-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402717.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its gene is related to the prognosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In this study, we examined the expression of nm23-H1 protein on the lymphoma cell surface of NHL. In 28 of 108 cases (25.9%), we observed > or = 20% of cell surface nm23-H1 protein expression and expression was especially high in peripheral T cell lymphomas and extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas. We also observed a significant correlation between serum nm23-H1 level and cell surface nm23-H1 expression levels. In patients with high levels of cell surface nm23-H1 expression, overall and progression-free survival rates were significantly lower than those in patients with low surface nm23-H1 expression levels. When surface nm23-H1 and serum nm23-H1 were combined, patients with high levels of both exhibited a poorer prognosis than patients with a high level of one or the other. These results indicate that in addition to serum nm23-H1, cell surface nm23-H1 may be used as a prognostic factor in planning a treatment strategy. The nm23-H1 protein appears to be intimately related to biological aggressiveness of lymphoma and, therefore, might be a molecular target of NHL treatment.","['Niitsu, N', 'Honma, Y', 'Iijima, K', 'Takagi, T', 'Higashihara, M', 'Sawada, U', 'Okabe-Kado, J']","['Niitsu N', 'Honma Y', 'Iijima K', 'Takagi T', 'Higashihara M', 'Sawada U', 'Okabe-Kado J']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine IV, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara-shi, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402699 [doi]', '2402699 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):196-202. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402699.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of samples from healthy donors and patients (B-ALL, B-CLL or AML, but not MM) was positive for EBV and contained <100 ebv copies/100 ng dna. ebv loads were occasionally high (>500 copies/100 ng DNA) in B-ALL (2/16) and in B-CLL (2/21) samples. The fractions of samples positive for HHV-8 and HHV-6A, less than 10% for MM patients, were high for adults with B-ALL (18.8% HHV-8+, 43.8% HHV-6A+) or B-CLL (28.6% HHV-8+, 52.4% HHV-6A+). B-ALL, B-CLL and MM samples were rarely positive for HHV-6B and HHV-7. Lastly, 75% of B-ALL samples were positive for CMV, and CMV loads were significantly higher in B-ALL samples than in MM, B-CLL or AML samples. We also used PCR with consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOP) to look for novel HHVs in B cell samples: no sequence indicative of a new HHV was detected. Altogether, the data indicate that the presence of multiple HHVs, including EBV and CMV at high loads, is not rare in B-ALL and B-CLL cell samples. Future prospective studies should determine whether patients with high EBV/CMV loads at diagnosis in tumor samples face a higher risk of delayed hematological recovery, virus-related complications or relapse.","['Hermouet, S', 'Sutton, C A', 'Rose, T M', 'Greenblatt, R J', 'Corre, I', 'Garand, R', 'Neves, A M', 'Bataille, R', 'Casey, J W']","['Hermouet S', 'Sutton CA', 'Rose TM', 'Greenblatt RJ', 'Corre I', 'Garand R', 'Neves AM', 'Bataille R', 'Casey JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['T2ES07052E/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 7, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Load']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402748 [doi]', '2402748 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):185-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402748.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemokine SDF-1 is present on BMEC and plays a crucial role in bone marrow engraftment. We studied the role of proteoglycans (PGs) on BMEC in binding and presentation of SDF-1. SDF-1 mRNA was present in three human BMEC cell lines. Competition experiments showed that 125I-SDF-1 alpha binding to the BMEC cell line 4LHBMEC was inhibited by heparins, heparan sulfate (HS) intestinal mucosa, chondroitin and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), but not by HS bovine kidney. Pretreatment of 4LHBMEC with glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-degrading enzymes or sodium chlorate demonstrated that SDF-1 bound to both HSPGs and CS/DSPGs in a sulfation-dependent manner, as determined with an SDF-1 antibody recognizing the CXCR4-binding site. 4LHBMEC bound four-fold more SDF-1 than HUVEC. Isolated endothelial PGs did not bind SDF-1 in a filter or microplate-binding assay, suggesting the necessity of membrane association. In flow adhesion experiments, endothelial arrest of CXCR4+ KG-1 and not of CXCR4- KG-1a cells increased significantly when SDF-1 was presented on 4LHBMEC. In conclusion, SDF-1 is produced by BMEC and binds to the BMEC cell surface via HS and CS/DS-GAGs, thereby presenting its CXCR4 binding site to HPC contributing to their arrest.","['Netelenbos, T', 'van den Born, J', 'Kessler, F L', 'Zweegman, S', 'Merle, P A', 'van Oostveen, J W', 'Zwaginga, J J', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Drager, A M']","['Netelenbos T', 'van den Born J', 'Kessler FL', 'Zweegman S', 'Merle PA', 'van Oostveen JW', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Huijgens PC', 'Drager AM']","['Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chlorates)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '24967-94-0 (Dermatan Sulfate)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'T95DR77GMR (sodium chlorate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chlorates/pharmacology', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dermatan Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2001/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402738 [doi]', '2402738 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):175-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402738.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, it was determined that the majority of HSCs in the bone marrow of 5-week-old mice are CD38-, with a minority being CD38+. These observations indicated that the CD38+ subpopulation of HSC appears before the age of 5 weeks and expands during adolescence. However, the majority of HSCs of 5-week-old mice became CD38+ following injection of 5-fluorouracil, indicating that activation of juvenile stem cells enhances CD38 expression.

However, data on the homing abilities of primary and culture-expanded MSC are lacking. In order to systematically investigate MSC homing we compared the fate of both primary and cultured MSC in a syngeneic mouse model. Twenty-four hours after transplantation of uncultured EGFP-transgenic MSC into sublethally irradiated mice, as many as 55-65% of injected CFU-F were recovered from the BM and 3.5-7% from the spleen. In the subsequent 4 weeks these donor CFU-F expanded 100-fold, which resulted in a normalization of femoral and splenic CFU-F numbers. This highly efficient homing of primary CFU-F contrasted with the defective homing of MSC following culture. Following their infusion immortalized multipotent syngeneic stromal cells were undetectable in BM, spleen, lymph nodes or thymus. Remarkably, following transplantation of primary MSC that had been cultured for only 24 h the seeding fraction in the BM was reduced to 10%, while after transplantation of 48 h cultured primary MSC no CFU-F were detected in the lymphohematopoietic organs. These data suggest that in vitro propagation of BM-derived MSC dramatically decreases their homing to BM and spleen.","['Rombouts, W J C', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Rombouts WJ', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Department of Haematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Graft Survival', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402763 [doi]', '2402763 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):160-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402763.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two clusters differed by their proliferative potential and appeared to discriminate patients with very different clinical course and outcome. s-TK was strikingly different among these two clusters, suggesting that s-TK level could be used routinely to identify patients at risk of progression.","['Magnac, C', 'Porcher, R', 'Davi, F', 'Nataf, J', 'Payelle-Brogard, B', 'Tang, R P', 'Oppezzo, P', 'Levy, V', 'Dighiero, G', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, F']","['Magnac C', 'Porcher R', 'Davi F', 'Nataf J', 'Payelle-Brogard B', 'Tang RP', 'Oppezzo P', 'Levy V', 'Dighiero G', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F']","['Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402780 [doi]', '2402780 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):133-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402780.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genetic aberrations may lead to the constitutive activation of the receptor, thus providing the molecular basis for a persisting growth stimulus. We have screened 69 AML-derived cell lines for FLT3 mutations. Four of these cell lines showed ITD of the FLT3 gene, none carried a D835 point mutation. Two cell lines (MUTZ-11 and MV4-11) expressed exclusively the mutated allele, the other two cell lines (MOLM-13 and PL-21) displayed a mutated and the wild-type version of the gene. Although mutationally activated FLT3 is supposed to substitute for the stimulatory signal of a growth factor, one of these cell lines (MUTZ-11) was strictly cytokine-dependent. FLT3 transcripts were found in all four cell lines, but the constitutively phosphorylated receptor protein was clearly detectable only in cell line MV4-11, possibly explaining why MUTZ-11 cells were growth-factor dependent. Thus, not all FLT3 ITD-positive cells express high levels of the active receptor protein, a finding that might be of relevance for a possible future application of a kinase inhibitor as therapeutic agent. It had been described that STAT-5 phosphorylation was part of the FLT3 signalling chain and that STAT-5 molecules were constitutively phosphorylated in FLT3 ITD-positive cells. Although we observed the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT-5 molecules in FLT3-mutant cells, FLT3 ligand (FL) did not induce STAT-5 phosphorylation in FLT3 wild-type cells. These results suggest that the signalling mechanisms of the mutated FL receptor differ at least to some extent from those conferred by wild-type FLT3. In conclusion, (1) not all cells with FLT3 ITD express significant amounts of the mutated receptor protein; (2) signals downstream from wild-type and mutant FLT3 receptors are not 100% identical; and (3) MV4-11 represents a model cell line for FLT3 ITD signalling.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Reinhardt, J', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Reinhardt J', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/immunology/metabolism', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402740 [doi]', '2402740 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):120-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402740.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-specific DNA has been documented in the sera of patients with solid tumors even when it is in an early stage. We compared the detection of FLT3 ITD in DNA extracted from cells of bone marrow (BM) aspirations with DNA extracted from peripheral blood (PB) plasma in patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 85 patients), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 16 patients), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; 16 patients). FLT3 ITD was detected in 18 (21%) AML samples and in one (6%) MDS sample in both cellular and plasma DNA but in none of the ALL samples. Hemizygous/homozygous FLT3 ITD was detected in five (28%) of the FLT3 ITD-positive AML using plasma DNA, whereas only four of these cases showed hemizygous/homozygous FLT3 ITD using cellular DNA. The presence of FLT3 ITD was associated with significantly shorter survival (P = 0.02) when only patients younger than 50 years of age (48 AML+MDS patients) were considered. This finding was independent of cytogenetics in this age group. However, patients with the FLT3 ITD hemizygous/homozygous phenotype had even shorter survival (P = <0.001). As expected, the presence of FLT3 ITD correlated with higher white blood cell (WBC) counts. These data demonstrate that plasma DNA is a reliable alternative resource for detecting FLT3ITD, especially the hemizygous/homozygous genotype. Furthermore, the data derived from this study support the notion that the presence of FLT3 ITD in conjunction with the absence of the wild-type FLT3 allele predicts an especially poor prognosis for patients with AML.","['Jilani, I', 'Estey, E', 'Manshuri, T', 'Caligiuri, M', 'Keating, M', 'Giles, F', 'Thomas, D', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Albitar, M']","['Jilani I', 'Estey E', 'Manshuri T', 'Caligiuri M', 'Keating M', 'Giles F', 'Thomas D', 'Kantarjian H', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402743 [doi]', '2402743 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):114-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, we evaluated the capacity of these cells to differentiate along the granulocytic and monocytic pathways. c-fms was constitutively and constantly expressed in all cases sensitive in vivo to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its expression was further potentiated following in vitro induction with ATRA. Furthermore, gel-shift analysis of APL cells showed elevated levels of PU.1 binding activity to the M-CSF receptor promoter, particularly after ATRA stimulation. Interestingly, the rise of PU.1 binding activity as well as of PU.1 levels after ATRA treatment was significantly higher in APL patients exhibiting monocytic maturation, as compared to those that did not undergo monocytic differentiation. A variable proportion of ATRA-induced APL cells exhibited monocyte-like morphology and immunophenotype: the proportion of monocytic cells was consistently increased by combined treatment with ATRA and diverse hematopoietic growth factors cocktails, which always comprised M-CSF. Monocytic cells originating from in vitro ATRA-induced maturation of APL cells derive from the leukemic clone as suggested by two lines of evidence: (1) monocytic cells harbor the 15;17 translocation; (2) monocytic cells possess Auer bodies. The c-fms(bright) leukemic blasts preferentially showed the capacity for monocytic differentiation as compared to the c-fms(dim/-) subset: indeed, enforced expression of c-fms into NB4, a PML/RAR alpha+ cell line, favored the onset of monocytic maturation. Finally, low c-fms expression was observed in an APL relapsing patient resistant to ATRA, as well as in an APL case with t(11;17), PLZF/RAR alpha+. These observations indicate that PML/RAR alpha+ APL blasts are bipotent for differentiation through both neutrophilic and monocytic lineages, whereby monocytic differentiation is linked to c-fms expression and stimulation.","['Riccioni, R', 'Saulle, E', 'Militi, S', 'Sposi, N M', 'Gualtiero, M', 'Mauro, N', 'Mancini, M', 'Diverio, D', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Peschle, C', 'Testa, U']","['Riccioni R', 'Saulle E', 'Militi S', 'Sposi NM', 'Gualtiero M', 'Mauro N', 'Mancini M', 'Diverio D', 'Lo Coco F', 'Peschle C', 'Testa U']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402812 [doi]', '2402812 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):98-113. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402812.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty control bone marrows and 15 cases of CML in blastic phase were also studied. Microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and several size- and shape-related parameters were quantitated in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. Overall, the group of chronic phase CML had higher MVD and size-related parameters and more branching microvessels than controls. Blastic phase was characterized by increased numbers of microvessels with a rounder shape and smaller caliber than chronic phase. A positive correlation emerged between marrow fibrosis and MVD as well as between white blood cell counts and rounder vessel sections. No relationship existed between microvascular parameters and Hasford or Sokal prognostic scores. In univariate analysis, overall and progression-free survival were adversely affected by MVD, size-related parameters, increased platelet count, age and spleen size. Multivariate analysis indicated that microvessel area was related to progression-free survival, whereas both MVD and area were significant prognosticators of overall survival, even when Hasford or Sokal scores are introduced into the model. Our data suggest that changes in angiogenic parameters may participate in the conversion of normal marrow to CML and ultimately to blastic transformation.

Defects in either of these genes have been associated with genetic instability in a wide variety of malignancies. A molecular mechanism involved in aberrant MMR gene expression is the epigenetic silencing of transcription by promoter methylation. The importance of MMR promoter methylation in leukemia is presently unclear and we have therefore undertaken a detailed analysis of the promoter regions of hMLH1 and hMSH2 using the technique of bisulfite genomic sequencing. DNA from 55 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) including 23 patients with therapy-related AML (t-AML) have been analyzed. Two patients with de novo AML demonstrated extensive methylation throughout the whole hMLH1 region sequenced, one of whom had previously shown widespread genetic instability, measured as microsatellite instability (MSI). However methylation of hMLH1 was not found in t-AML which has previously been associated with MSI. In addition, methylation was seen at a restricted region of the hMLH1 promoter in both AML patients and healthy controls. The significance of this methylated region of the hMLH1 promoter is uncertain, however, our results confirm that in some patients with AML extensive methylation of hMLH1, but not of hMSH2 may occur, and as is the case in solid tumors this can be associated with the presence of a defective DNA mismatch repair pathway resulting in MSI.","['Seedhouse, C H', 'Das-Gupta, E P', 'Russell, N H']","['Seedhouse CH', 'Das-Gupta EP', 'Russell NH']","['Division of Haematology, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK. seedhouse@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Base Pair Mismatch/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402747 [doi]', '2402747 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):83-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402747.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL rearrangements are associated with distinct clinical features and a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and the prognostic significance of MLL rearrangements in a consecutive series of adult AML patients and to determine the immunophenotypic features of these cases. The identification of abnormal immunophenotypes could be used for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). Ninety-three adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were analyzed by Southern blot in order to detect MLL rearrangements (MLL+). RT-PCR and genomic long-range PCR were performed to further characterize MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD) in those patients in whom conventional karyotype did not show 11q23 chromosomal translocations. All the patients were homogeneously immunophenotyped at diagnosis. MLL rearrangements were detected in 13 (14%) patients. Four patients (5%) showed 11q23 translocations by karyotypic conventional analysis. Nine patients (10%) revealed PTD of MLL and one patient showed a MLL cleavage pattern. The MLL+ patients usually expressed myeloid and monocytic antigens CD33 (12/13 cases), CD13 (9/13), CD117 (9/13), CD64 (11/13) and in some cases CD14 (4/11). HLA-DR was also positive in (12/13). Eight out of 13 cases expressed the stem cell marker CD34. Only one patient revealed lymphoid marker reactivity (CD7) and CD56 was expressed in 5/13 cases. All the MLL+ patients showed at least one aberrant phenotype at diagnosis, which allowed us to set out a simple panel for the MRD studies. Twenty-seven samples from eight patients in morphologic complete remission (CR) were analyzed using the aberrant immunologic combinations detected at diagnosis. Phenotypically abnormal cells were detected in all the patients who subsequently relapsed, whereas only one patient with MRD+ remained in CR. Owing to the high level of residual leukemic cells, the MLL+ patients showed a short CR duration and a poor survival. In conclusion, immunophenotyping may be a suitable approach to investigating MRD status in AML patients with PTD of the MLL gene.","['Munoz, L', 'Nomdedeu, J F', 'Villamor, N', 'Guardia, R', 'Colomer, D', 'Ribera, J M', 'Torres, J P', 'Berlanga, J J', 'Fernandez, C', 'Llorente, A', 'Queipo de Llano, M P', 'Sanchez, J M', 'Brunet, S', 'Sierra, J']","['Munoz L', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Villamor N', 'Guardia R', 'Colomer D', 'Ribera JM', 'Torres JP', 'Berlanga JJ', 'Fernandez C', 'Llorente A', 'Queipo de Llano MP', 'Sanchez JM', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu, Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Remission Induction', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2001/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402708 [doi]', '2402708 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):76-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402708.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Spanish CETLAM Group'],,,

The relapse rate at 12 months was 67% in a group with >0.8% CD34+ cells and 34% in a group with < or = 0.8% CD34+ cells. Although the percentage of malignant CD34+ cells in the CD34+ compartment in the relapses of the first group was not high (median 8%), the total number of malignant cells as a percentage of WBC was about 13 times higher than for the patients remaining >12 months in remission. When all patients evaluable were taken together, this frequency of malignant cells correlated strongly with disease-free survival (P < 0.001). Both this massive mobilization of normal CD34+ cells and high frequency of malignant cells in the subgroup of patients with CD34 >0.8% and relapse within 12 months indicate an insufficient in vivo purging, as well as low chemotherapeutic bone marrow toxicity. This was confirmed by an inverse correlation between hypoplasia period after the induction therapy and CD34% in PBSC products (P < 0.002).

We hypothesized that a decreased ability to mobilize stem cells reflects a chemotherapy-induced reduction in the number of normal and leukemic stem cells. We therefore analyzed whether the mobilizing capacity of these patients was of prognostic significance. 342 AML-patients in first CR received daily G-CSF from day 20 of the consolidation course and underwent 1-6 aphereses to obtain a minimum dose of 2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. Afterwards they were randomized for autologous bone marrow (BM) or blood SCT. As a surrogate marker for the mobilizing capacity, the highest yield of CD34+ cells of a single apheresis was adopted. Patients could be categorized into four groups: no harvest (n = 76), low yield (<1 x 10(6) CD34+/kg; n = 50), intermediate yield (1-6.9 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg; n = 128) and high yield (> or = 7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg; n = 88). The median follow-up was 3.4 years; 163 relapses and 16 deaths in CR were reported. Autologous blood or BM SCT was performed in 36%, 64%, 81% and 88%, respectively, of the patients assigned to the no harvest, low, intermediate and high CD34+ yield group. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 46.7%, 65.0%, 50.4% and 26.9% (P = 0.0002) and the relapse incidence was 47.5%, 30.1%, 43.1% and 71.9% (P < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model showed that the CD34+ yield was the most important independent prognostic variable (P = 0.005) after cytogenetics.

This cell line is characterized not only by the ability to secrete VEGF, but also for the presence on its surface of the VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1). Previous studies from our laboratory concerned with evaluating early changes in gene expression induced by aplidine in MOLT-4 cells have shown that the drug decreases the expression of VEGFR-1 (Marchini et al. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 2000; 41: 833). Here, we report the ability of aplidine to block the VEGF/VEGFR-1 loop. We found that aplidine blocked VEGF secretion that was temporally followed by a decrease in both VEGF and VEGFR-1 production. Aplidine did not directly affect either VEGF transcription or stabilization of its mRNA. Transfection of MOLT-4 cells with an antisense VEGF cDNA construct, resulted in inhibition of colony formations. One clone, transfected with sense VEGF cDNA, secreting 8-10 times more VEGF than parental cells, was less sensitive to aplidine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis than control cells. Moreover, addition of VEGF in the medium decreased the activity of aplidine in MOLT-4 cells. These data demonstrate that aplidine inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells through the inhibition of VEGF secretion which blocks the VEGF/VEGFR-1 autocrine loop necessary for the growth of these cells.","['Broggini, M', 'Marchini, S V', 'Galliera, E', 'Borsotti, P', 'Taraboletti, G', 'Erba, E', 'Sironi, M', 'Jimeno, J', 'Faircloth, G T', 'Giavazzi, R', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Broggini M', 'Marchini SV', 'Galliera E', 'Borsotti P', 'Taraboletti G', 'Erba E', 'Sironi M', 'Jimeno J', 'Faircloth GT', 'Giavazzi R', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Depsipeptides', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402788 [doi]', '2402788 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):52-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402788.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A French retrospective study of 238 patients.,45-51,"With the introduction of new drugs such as alpha-interferon (IFN) and purine analogs, the management of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients has changed. However, deoxycoformycin (DCF) produced higher complete remission rates than IFN. The current study was undertaken to provide long-term data on duration of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and incidence of subsequent malignancies. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients treated with DCF (4 mg/m2/day, every 2 weeks) from 39 French centers. In 84 of 238 included patients, DCF was the first-line therapy. Pretreatment variables influencing the achievement of complete remission, DFS, and OS were identified by multivariate analysis. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients received a median of nine cycles (range, 1-19 cycles). A complete remission was obtained in 182 of 230 evaluable patients (79%) and a partial response was obtained in 38 patients, for an overall response rate of 95.6%. In the multivariate analysis hemoglobin level less than 100 g/l and leukocytes less than 2 x 10(9)/l were parameters adversely influencing complete remission achievement. With a median follow-up of 63.5 months (range, 0.39-138.4 months), disease recurrence was observed in 34 of 220 responding patients (15%). The estimated 5-years and 10-years DFS was 88.1% and 68.8%, respectively. Hemoglobin level less than 100 g/l and leukocytes less than 2 x 10(9)/l were the pre-treatment variables associated with a shorter DFS. The estimated 5-year and 10-year OS were 89.4% and 88.7%, respectively. Hemoglobin level less than 100 g/l, leukocytes less than 2 x 10(9)/l, and adenopathy were significant factors of reduced survival. Hematologic toxicity was the main side-effect, followed by infection and emesis. During the period of follow-up, 18 patients developed second cancer, but the standardized incidence ratio was 0.95. Pentostatin is a highly effective regimen for hairy cell leukemia that produces durable complete responses. Toxicity of DCF is acceptable.

Our results therefore show that the IMiDs have more potent direct anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects than thalidomide in vivo, providing the framework for clinical protocols evaluating these agents in MM and other B cell neoplasms.","['Lentzsch, S', 'LeBlanc, R', 'Podar, K', 'Davies, F', 'Lin, B', 'Hideshima, T', 'Catley, L', 'Stirling, D I', 'Anderson, K C']","['Lentzsch S', 'LeBlanc R', 'Podar K', 'Davies F', 'Lin B', 'Hideshima T', 'Catley L', 'Stirling DI', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['P0-1 78378/PHS HHS/United States', 'R0-1 50947/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microcirculation/drug effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2002/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402745 [doi]', '2402745 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):41-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402745.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is that premalignant cells are usually indistinguishable from their normal counterparts, thereby ruling out the possibility to investigate the events that govern early leukemogenesis in vivo. Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a T cell malignancy that occurs after a 40-60-year period of clinical latency in about 3-5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals. ATLL cells are monoclonally expanded and harbor an integrated provirus. A persistent oligo/polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1-bearing cells has been shown to precede ATLL, supporting the fact that in ATLL tumor cells arise from a clonally expanding non-malignant cell. It is possible to isolate infected, ie preleukemic, cells during the premalignant asymptomatic phase of the infection, thus providing an exceptional system to study the mechanisms underlying human cancers.

AML1 protein contains a highly evolutionary conserved domain of 128 amino acids called runt domain, responsible for both heterodimerization with the beta subunit of CBF and for DNA binding. AML1 is normally expressed in all hematopoietic lineages and acts to regulate the expression of various genes specific to hematopoiesis playing a pivotal role in myeloid differentiation. AML1 is one of the genes most frequently deregulated in leukemia through different mechanisms including translocation, mutation and amplification. Translocations lead to the formation of fusion genes encoding for chimerical proteins such as AML1-ETO which induces leukemogenesis. Recently, new mechanisms of AML1 deregulation by point mutations or amplification have been reported. To our knowledge, 51 patients (among 805 studied) with AML1 point mutations have been described. Forty of them have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) most often M0 AML. In this subtype of AML, the frequency of AML1 mutation is significantly higher; 21.5% of patients mutated (34/158). Mutations have also been found with lower frequency in other FAB subtype AML (6 cases), in myeloproliferative disorders (6 cases), in myelodysplastic syndrome (3 cases) and rarely in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1 case). AML1 gene amplification has been found essentially in childhood ALL (12 cases) and more rarely in myeloid malignancies (4 cases). Here, we reviewed all these cases of AML1 point mutations and amplification and focused on the mechanisms of AML1 deregulation induced by these alterations.","['Roumier, C', 'Fenaux, P', 'Lafage, M', 'Imbert, M', 'Eclache, V', 'Preudhomme, C']","['Roumier C', 'Fenaux P', 'Lafage M', 'Imbert M', 'Eclache V', 'Preudhomme C']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie A, CHRU, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2001/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402766 [doi]', '2402766 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jan;17(1):9-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402766.,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the possible tumor suppressor role of the SHIP gene in myeloid leukemogenesis, we examined primary leukemia cells from 30 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, together with eight myeloid leukemia cell lines. A somatic mutation at codon 684, replacing Val with Glu, was detected in one patient, lying within the signature motif 2, which is the phosphatase active site. The results of an in vitro inositol 5'-phosphatase assay revealed that the mutation reduced catalytic activity of SHIP. Leukemia cells with the mutation showed enhanced Akt phosphorylation following IL-3 stimulation. K562 cells transfected with the mutated SHIP-V684E cDNA showed a growth advantage even at lower serum concentrations and resistance to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and exposure to etoposide. These results suggest a possible role of the mutated SHIP gene in the development of acute leukemia and chemotherapy resistance through the deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3)/Akt signaling pathway.

LIF acts on responding cells by binding to a heterodimeric membrane receptor composed of a low-affinity LIF-specific receptor and the gp130 receptor chain also used as the receptor for interleukin-6, oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. LIF is essential for blastocyst implantation and the normal development of hippocampal and olfactory receptor neurons. LIF is used extensively in experimental biology because of its key ability to induce embryonic stem cells to retain their totipotentiality. LIF has a wide array of actions, including acting as a stimulus for platelet formation, proliferation of some hematopoietic cells, bone formation, adipocyte lipid transport, adrenocorticotropic hormone production, neuronal survival and formation, muscle satellite cell proliferation, and acute phase production by hepatocytes. Unwanted actions of LIF can be minimized by circulating soluble LIF receptors and by intracellular suppression by suppressors of cytokine-signaling family members.

We demonstrate that HIPK1 is ubiquitously expressed in mice and humans and localizes predominantly to the nucleus. Daxx normally resides within the nucleus in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs), where it physically interacts with PML. Under certain circumstances, Daxx is relocalized from PODs to chromatin, where it then acts as a transcriptional repressor through an association with histone deacetylase (HDAC1). We propose two novel mechanisms for regulating the activity of Daxx, both mediated by HIPK1. First, HIPK1 physically interacts with Daxx in cells and consequently relocalizes Daxx from PODs. Daxx relocalization disrupts its interaction with PML and augments its interaction with HDAC1, likely influencing Daxx activity. Although the relocalization of Daxx from PODs is phosphorylation independent, an active HIPK1 kinase domain is required, suggesting that HIPK1 autophosphorylation is important in this interaction. Second, HIPK1 phosphorylates Daxx on Ser 669, and phosphorylation of this site is important in modulating the ability of Daxx to function as a transcriptional repressor. Mutation of Daxx Ser 669 to Ala results in increased repression in three of four transcriptional reporters, suggesting that phosphorylation by HIPK1 diminishes Daxx transcriptional repression of specific promoters. Taken together, our results indicate that HIPK1 and Daxx collaborate in regulating transcription.","['Ecsedy, Jeffrey A', 'Michaelson, Jennifer S', 'Leder, Philip']","['Ecsedy JA', 'Michaelson JS', 'Leder P']","['Department of Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Hipk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC140690,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.3.950-960.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Feb;23(3):950-60. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.3.950-960.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesized that CDKIs block viral replication by inhibiting transcription of specific cellular genes. Here we find that three CDKIs, flavopiridol, purvalanol A, and methoxy-roscovitine, block Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) transcription events. Using gene expression microarray technology to examine the inhibitory effects of CDKIs, we observed a cellular gene, the pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) gene, down-regulated by CDKI treatment. The PBX consensus element (PCE), TGATTGAC, is conserved in the long terminal repeats of several murine retroviruses, including Moloney MLV. Mutations in the PCE completely inhibited viral transcription whereas overexpression of PBX1 and a PBX1-associated protein, PREP1, enhanced viral transcription. The interaction between the PCE and PBX1-PREP1 proteins was confirmed by gel shift experiments. Blocking PBX1 protein synthesis resulted in a significant decrease in viral transcription. Collectively, our results represent the first work demonstrating that the homeodomain proteins PBX1 and PREP1 are cellular factors involved in Moloney MLV transcription regulation.","['Chao, Sheng-Hao', 'Walker, John R', 'Chanda, Sumit K', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Caldwell, Jeremy S']","['Chao SH', 'Walker JR', 'Chanda SK', 'Gray NS', 'Caldwell JS']","['Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, San Diego, California 92121, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",PMC140703,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.3.831-841.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Feb;23(3):831-41. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.3.831-841.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results demonstrated that nuclear matrix proteins might play important roles in regulating the expression of human beta-like globin genes through their interaction with HSs (HS2, HS3 and HS4 core sequences) in the LCR. Moreover, the results obtained from the in vitro DNA-matrix binding assay showed that the core DNA sequences of DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS2, HS3 and HS4) were unable to bind to the nuclear matrix isolated from uninduced HEL cells; in addition, HS2 core DNA sequence was capable of binding to the nuclear matrix prepared from Hu-induced HEL cells, while both HS3 and HS4 core DNA sequences could not do so. Results indicated that the HS2 core DNA sequence may be a functional MAR (matrix attachment region). We suggest that the HS2 core DNA sequence binding to the nuclear matrix in Hu-induced HEL cells may open the structure of chromatin to make the LCR accessible to the promoter of beta-globin gene and to promote its transcription.","['Zhang, Shu Bing', 'Qian, Ruo Lan']","['Zhang SB', 'Qian RL']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Locus Control Region/*genetics', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cr.7290144 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Res. 2002 Dec;12(5-6):411-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7290144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-treatment of PKC inhibitor or MEK1 inhibitor markedly increased or decreased the rIL-16 induced growth-inhibiting effects on Jurkat cells, respectively.

Potential applications are: prognostic factor for risk-group stratification, tailored chemotherapy for subgroups or individual patients with a specific cellular drug resistance profile, determination of cross-resistance patterns, study of drug interactions, study of resistance modulation or circumvention, selection of patients for phase II studies and screening for the cytotoxicity of novel compounds. The colorimetric 4-day MTT assay is a frequently used method. However, a distinction between malignant and non-malignant cells cannot be made, which should be taken into account. In the case of a relatively high percentage of contaminating non-malignant cells, the differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay can be used. The MTT assay's technical success percentage is about 80% for fresh ALL and AML samples. For methotrexate (MTX) a different assay must be used, such as the thymidylate synthase inhibition assay (TSIA). The MTT assay measures the number of living cells that survived drug exposure. Therefore, the effect of many if not most drugs to induce leukemia cell death by apoptosis is also included. This review mainly summarizes the data on cellular drug resistance in childhood leukemia, as obtained by the MTT assay and TSIA, in our laboratory in Amsterdam. These data clearly demonstrate the significant relation between in vitro cellular drug resistance and clinical and cell biological features and short- and long-term clinical outcome in childhood leukemia. In conclusion, cellular drug resistance testing provides clinically relevant information that can be available within 1 week and can be performed successfully in the vast majority of leukemia samples.

To detect proliferation, we selected a universal marker--ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is expressed early in the cell cycle and has a short half-life. This marker was detected in hematological cancer cells by quantitative immunohistochemical analyses using an ODC antibody and a FITC-linked second antibody. Drug resistance was detected in five patients, who subsequently died. Lymphocytes from normal individuals were sensitive to all drugs tested, whereas 33 leukemia and lymphoma patients showed different sensitivities to certain drugs. The method also permitted testing of the effect of new drugs on the proliferation of lymphocytes from hematological cancer patients. This test is sensitive, and 100-1,000 cells are required per assay, which can be completed within 2 days.

We now have 12 years' experience of using this method in a variety of tumour types, both haematological and solid malignancies. Tumour cells are isolated from bone marrow, malignant effusions or solid biopsies and subjected to drug exposure for 48-96 h. Cell survival is measured by re-incubation in MTT for 4 h. We have found a significant correlation of in vitro results with in vivo outcome for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and for ovarian cancer (both p < 0.0001) with an assay sensitivity of 98% for AML and 81% for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the 5-year survival of ovarian cancer patients treated with a drug found sensitive in vitro is significantly higher than that for patients treated with a drug found resistant in vitro (p = 0.033). We have correlated assay results with drug resistance markers. For example, expression of the newly described half transporter BCRP is related to daunorubicin resistance (p < 0.05). The MTT assay is also suitable for screening for modulation of drug resistance. We have found that the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin markedly increases in vitro sensitivity to the platinum drugs in ovarian cancer and cytosine arabinoside in AML in the majority of patients. The greatest effect was seen for patients deemed resistant in vitro to these agents. We have identified novel drug combinations which demonstrate significant synergism using this methodology and have also used it to study the emergence of drug resistance in cell line models with a view to its prevention. In conclusion, we have found the MTT assay to be a simple, repeatable, adaptable technique which produces accurate information to help the clinician select suitable treatment for individual cases.","['Sargent, Jean M']",['Sargent JM'],"['Haematology Research, Pembury Hospital, Tonbridge Road, Pembury, Kent, TN2 4QJ, UK. jean.sargent@btinternet.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The concept of GIST and the definition of GIST pathology have evolved greatly over the past 5 years. GIST has been shown to share immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and histogenic similarities with the interstitial cells of Cajal. Both GIST and the interstitial cells of Cajal express KIT, the receptor tyrosine kinase that is the protein product of the c-kit proto-oncogene. KIT is universally phosphorylated in GISTs. Sequencing of c-kit complementary DNA from human GIST cells has demonstrated a high frequency of mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase in the absence of stimulation by its physiologic ligand (stem cell factor). This, in turn, causes uncontrolled stimulation of downstream signaling cascades with aberrant cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Historically, malignant GIST has been highly refractory to conventional cytotoxic therapy. Signal transduction inhibition as cancer therapy was first tested successfully with imatinib mesylate (formerly known as STI571), a selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with the initial target being blockade of Bcr-Abl, the oncogene with tyrosine kinase activity responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib was subsequently shown to block activity of the KIT tyrosine kinase as well, and in laboratory studies this led to apoptotic death of GIST cells. The first GIST patient to receive imatinib exhibited dramatic benefit despite far-advanced metastatic disease that was previously refractory to all chemotherapy. Subsequently, multicenter clinical trials have been performed to assess the safety, efficacy and biologic activity of imatinib in patients with advanced GIST. The results from these studies have established imatinib as an effective new therapeutic alternative for the majority of patients with advanced GIST, a solid tumor for which no prior chemotherapy has ever shown antitumor efficacy. This work provides proof of concept to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of aberrant signal transduction can provide important anticancer activity, if the proper signaling pathways are identified and blocked.","['Demetri, George D']",['Demetri GD'],"['Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. gdemetri@partners.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms, Connective Tissue/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Stromal Cells', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed']",,2003/01/17 04:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2003/01/17 04:00'],"['2003/01/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(02)80603-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(02)80603-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2002 Sep;38 Suppl 5:S52-9. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(02)80603-7.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in particular, depends on formation of the bcr-abl oncogene, leading to constitutive expression of the tyrosine kinase fusion protein, Bcr-Abl. Based on these observations, imatinib was developed as a specific inhibitor for the Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase. The expanding understanding of the basis of imatinib-mediated tyrosine kinase inhibition has revealed a spectrum of potential new antitumor applications beyond the powerful activity already reported in the treatment of CML. Imatinib has shown activity in vivo against PDGF-driven tumor models including glioblastoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Antiangiogenic effects have been demonstrated by inhibition of PDGF-, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)- and bFGF- (basic fibroblast growth factor) induced angiogenesis in vivo, and by inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in an experimental bone metastasis model. Imatinib has been shown to reduce interstitial fluid pressure in an experimental colonic carcinoma model by blocking PDGF-mediated effects on tumor-associated blood vessels and stromal tissue. It is also a potent inhibitor of the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, and has demonstrated activity clinically against the Kit-driven gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and experimentally in small-cell lung cancer cell lines.

Here, we demonstrate that monensin inhibited the proliferation of solid tumor cells with IC50 of about 2.5 micro M. Monensin induced a G1 or a G2-M phase arrest in these cells. When we examined the effects of this drug on SNU-C1 cells, monensin decreased the levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1 and cyclin A proteins. While p27 was increased by monensin, p21 was not. In addition, monensin markedly enhanced the binding of p27 with CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6. Furthermore, the activities of CDK2-, CDK4- and CDK6-associated kinase were reduced in association with hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. Monensin also induced apoptosis in solid tumor cells. Apoptotic process of SNU-C1 cells was associated with the changes of Bax, caspase-3 and mitochondria transmembrane potential (deltapsim). Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time that monensin inhibited the growth of solid tumor cells, especially SNU-C1 cells, via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","['Park, Woo Hyun', 'Kim, Eun Shil', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Lee, Young Yiul']","['Park WH', 'Kim ES', 'Jung CW', 'Kim BK', 'Lee YY']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Feb;22(2):377-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although TEL is essential for establishing hematopoiesis in neonatal bone marrow, its role in erythroid lineage is not understood. To investigate a role for TEL in erythroid differentiation, we introduced TEL into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Overexpressing wild-type-TEL in MEL cells enhanced differentiation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide or dimethylsulfoxide, as judged by the increased levels of erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase and beta-globin mRNAs. TEL bound to a corepressor mSin3A through the helix-loop-helix domain. A TEL mutant lacking this domain still bound to the ETS binding site, but lost its transrepressional effect. This mutant completely blocked erythroid differentiation in MEL cells. Moreover, it showed dominant-negative effects over TEL-mediated transcriptional repression and acceleration of erythroid differentiation. Endogenous TEL mRNA was found to increase during the first 3 days in differentiating MEL cells and drastically decrease thereafter. All these data suggest that TEL might play some role in erythroid cell differentiation.","['Waga, Kazuo', 'Nakamura, Yuichi', 'Maki, Kazuhiro', 'Arai, Honoka', 'Yamagata, Tetsuya', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Hirai, Hisamaru', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Waga K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Maki K', 'Arai H', 'Yamagata T', 'Sasaki K', 'Kurokawa M', 'Hirai H', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*isolation & purification', 'Globins/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206072 [doi]', '1206072 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jan 9;22(1):59-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate the subcellular location and extent of p53-associated 3'--> 5' exonuclease activity, we established an in vitro experimental system of cell lines with different nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of p53. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts obtained from LCC2 cells (expressing a high level of cytoplasmic wild-type p53), MCF-7 cells (expressing a high level of wild-type nuclear p53), MDA cells (expressing mutant p53) and H1299 cells (p53-null) were subjected to the analysis of exonuclease activity. Interestingly, 3'-->5' exonuclease was predominantly cytoplasmic; the nuclear extracts derived from all cell lines tested, exerted a low level of exonuclease activity. Cytoplasmic extracts of LCC2 cells, with a high level of wild-type p53, showed an enhanced exonuclease activity in comparison to those expressing either a low level of wild-type p53 (in MCF-7 cells) or the mutant p53 (in MDA cells). Evidence that exonuclease function detected in cytoplasmic extracts is attributed to the p53 is supported by several facts: First, this activity closely parallels with levels and status of endogenous cytoplasmic p53. Second, immunoprecipitation of p53 from cytoplasmic extracts of LCC2 cells markedly reduced the exonuclease activity. Third, the observed 3'-->5' exonuclease in cytoplasmic fraction of LCC2 cells displays identical biochemical properties characteristic of recombinant wild-type p53. The biochemical functions include: (a) substrate specificity; exonuclease hydrolyzes single-stranded DNA in preference to double-stranded DNA and RNA/DNA template-primers, (b) efficient excision of 3'-terminal mispairs from DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA substrates, (c) the preferential excision of purine-purine mispairs over purine-pyrimidine mispairs and (d) functional interaction with exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase, for example, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (representing a relatively low fidelity enzyme), thus enhancing the fidelity of DNA synthesis by excision of mismatched nucleotides from the nascent DNA strand. Taken together, the data demonstrate that wild-type p53 in cytoplasm, in its noninduced state, is functional; it displays intrinsic 3'-->5' exonuclease activity. The possible role of p53-associated 3'-->5' exonuclease activity in DNA repair in nucleus and cytoplasm is discussed.","['Lilling, Gila', 'Elena, Novitsky', 'Sidi, Yechezkel', 'Bakhanashvili, Mary']","['Lilling G', 'Elena N', 'Sidi Y', 'Bakhanashvili M']","['Department of Medicine C, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.5 (Exodeoxyribonuclease V)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Compartmentation/physiology', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Exodeoxyribonuclease V', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206111 [doi]', '1206111 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jan 16;22(2):233-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta signals by binding to its cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, which in turn phosphorylate downstream signal transducers, Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3, together with Smad4, enter the nucleus and associate with various transcription factors. This complex of transcription factors regulates transcription of a diverse group of genes, leading to growth arrest at G1 phase. Through a functional expression cloning approach, a gag-retinoid X receptor beta (gag-RXRbeta) fusion protein was found to antagonize TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition of mink lung epithelial cells and the fusion between gag and RXRbeta is essential for resistance to the growth inhibition. Like gag-RXRbeta, the oncogenic PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein also antagonizes TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition, and the fusion between PLZF and RARalpha is essential for resistance to TGF-beta. Moreover, TGF-beta and retinoic acid (RA) cooperatively induce growth inhibition as well as transcription of the p15(ink4b) gene, while PLZF-RARalpha represses TGF-beta-induced expression of the p15(ink4b) gene. Together, these results suggest that the TGF-beta and RA pathways cooperate to inhibit cell growth and that PLZF-RARalpha -mediated resistance to TGF-beta may facilitate the development of the PLZF-RARalpha-induced leukemia.","['La, Ping', 'Morgan, Trish A', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Mao, Hua', 'Schnepp, Robert W', 'Petersen, Clark D', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['La P', 'Morgan TA', 'Sykes SM', 'Mao H', 'Schnepp RW', 'Petersen CD', 'Hua X']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],['1K01CA78592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung/*cytology', 'Mink', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206100 [doi]', '1206100 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jan 16;22(2):198-210. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell death response to oxidative stress is thought to contribute to aging, neurological degeneration, and other disorders. ROS-induced apoptosis and necrosis involves activation of the cytoplasmic c-Abl tyrosine kinase and thereby signaling to mitochondria. Herein, we show that STI571, an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia, blocks activation of c-Abl in the response of mouse embryo fibroblasts and human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that STI571 decreases H(2)O(2)-induced targeting of c-Abl to mitochondria in the two cell types by 59 to 85%. The results also show that STI571 attenuates H(2)O(2)-induced loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In concert with these effects, STI571 inhibits the death response to H(2)O(2) exposure by 40 to 80% depending on the cell type. These findings indicate that inhibition of c-Abl signaling by STI571 attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in the cellular response to oxidative stress.","['Kumar, Shailendra', 'Mishra, Neerad', 'Raina, Deepak', 'Saxena, Satya', 'Kufe, Donald']","['Kumar S', 'Mishra N', 'Raina D', 'Saxena S', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/02/22 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.63.2.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2003 Feb;63(2):276-82. doi: 10.1124/mol.63.2.276.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon includes both genome-wide hypomethylation and gene- specific hypermethylation. However, the clinical relevance of either mechanism has remained contentious. In order to determine DNA methylation levels from a large number of clinical samples, we have established a method for accurate high-throughput quantification of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA. Our protocol requires a small amount (<1 micro g) of DNA that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to single nucleotides. Single nucleotides are then derivatized with a fluorescent marker and separated by capillary electrophoresis. After calibration of the method, we have determined cytosine methylation levels from tumor samples of 81 patients that had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These patients showed a high variability in their methylation levels with a general trend towards hypomethylation. Because of its high accuracy and throughput our method will be useful in determining the role of genomic DNA methylation levels in tumorigenesis.","['Stach, Dirk', 'Schmitz, Oliver J', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Benner, Axel', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Wiessler, Manfred', 'Lyko, Frank']","['Stach D', 'Schmitz OJ', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Benner A', 'Dohner H', 'Wiessler M', 'Lyko F']","['Division of Molecular Toxicology, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Cytosine/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC140527,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gng002 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 15;31(2):E2. doi: 10.1093/nar/gng002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now studied the effect of cholesteryl-hemisuccinate (CS) on the fate of HL-60 cells to clarify whether CS has an effect similar to that of VES. CS inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells without differentiation to granulocytes and induced DNA fragmentation and ladder formation. CS inhibited the phosphorylation of pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein kinase B (Akt) and initiated the activation of a caspase cascade. CS triggered the reaction leading to the cleavage of Bid and also released cytochrome c (Cyt. c) from mitochondria. In addition, CS induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and translocation of Bax to mitochondria in HL-60 cells. However, CS did not induce an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions in HL-60 cells. The membrane depolarization, Cyt. c release, and DNA fragmentation were inhibited by z-VAD-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), a pan-caspase inhibitor, but not by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of membrane permeability transition. These results suggested that CS-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells might be caused by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation following cleavage of Bid through caspase-8 activation and subsequently via an Apaf complex-caspase cascade pathway.","['Yamada, Katsuhiko', 'Arita, Kayo', 'Kobuchi, Hirotsugu', 'Yamamoto, Shinji', 'Yoshioka, Tamotsu', 'Tamai, Hiroshi', 'Utsumi, Kozo']","['Yamada K', 'Arita K', 'Kobuchi H', 'Yamamoto S', 'Yoshioka T', 'Tamai H', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical College, 2-7 Daigakucho, Takatsuki 569-8686, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'T3J4KS4201 (cholesteryl succinate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202015186 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01518-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Feb 1;65(3):339-48. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01518-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such channels activate after ATP-elicited release of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3))-sensitive calcium stores in leukemia HL-60 cells. The most potent DHPs were those containing a 4-phenyl group with an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as m- or p-nitro- or m-trifluoromethyl (IC(50) values: 3-6 microM). Benzyl esters, corresponding to the usual ethyl/methyl esters of the DHPs developed as L-type calcium channel blockers, retained potency at SOC channels, as did N-substituted DHPs. N-Methylation reduced by orders of magnitude the potency at L-type channels resulting in DHPs nearly equipotent at SOC and L-type channels. DHPs with N-ethyl, N-allyl, and N-propargyl groups also had similar potencies at SOC and L-type channels. Replacement of the usual 6-methyl group of DHPs with larger groups, such as cyclobutyl or phenyl, eliminated activity at the SOC channels; such DHPs instead elicited formation of inositol phosphates and release of IP(3)-sensitive calcium stores. Other DHPs also caused a release of calcium stores, but usually at significantly higher concentrations than those required for the inhibition of capacitative calcium influx. Certain DHPs appeared to cause an incomplete blockade of SOC channel-dependent elevations of calcium, suggesting the presence of more than one class of such channels in HL-60 cells. N-Methylnitrendipine (IC(50) 2.6 microM, MRS 1844) and N-propargylnifrendipine (IC(50) 1.7 microM, MRS 1845) represent possible lead compounds for the development of selective SOC channel inhibitors.","['Harper, Jacquie L', 'Camerini-Otero, Carol S', 'Li, An Hu', 'Kim, Soon Ai', 'Jacobson, Kenneth A', 'Daly, John W']","['Harper JL', 'Camerini-Otero CS', 'Li AH', 'Kim SA', 'Jacobson KA', 'Daly JW']","['Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bldg. 8, Rm. 1A17, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Z01 DK031127-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dihydropyridines/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology']",PMC4976593,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202014880 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01488-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Feb 1;65(3):329-38. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01488-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS807288'],,

This analog, methotrexate-phosphinate (MTX-phosphinate; 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-methylpteroyl-L-Glu-gamma-[psi(P(O)(OH)-CH(2))]glutarate), is a highly potent (K(is), 3.1+/-0.5 nM), competitive inhibitor of recombinant human cytosolic FPGS. Within experimental limits, FPGS inhibition was not time-dependent, and preincubation of FPGS, inhibitor, and ATP did not potentiate the inhibition. These results suggest that slow phosphorylation to produce a more potent inhibitor form is not involved. MTX-phosphinate was not growth inhibitory to human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells at 1 microM (70-fold above the concentration of MTX giving 50% growth inhibition), probably because of poor transport. Because of its exceedingly high potency as an FPGS inhibitor, MTX-phosphinate represents a lead structure from which cell-permeable analogs may be developed to test the hypothesis that FPGS inhibition is therapeutically efficacious.","['McGuire, John J', 'Haile, William H', 'Valiaeva, Nadya', 'Bartley, David', 'Guo, Jianxia', 'Coward, James K']","['McGuire JJ', 'Haile WH', 'Valiaeva N', 'Bartley D', 'Guo J', 'Coward JK']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

The presence of the TEL-AML1 fusion in utero, its protracted latency to overt leukemia, and secondary loss of the untranslocated TEL suggest it is an initiating event. Sequences of the TEL-AML1 genomic breakpoint and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and/or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were characterized in four pediatric pre-B ALL patients. Analysis of these markers in relapsed patients revealed that immunophenotypically and cytogenetically distinct, and clonally unrelated antigen receptor leukemic cell populations harbored the same initiating TEL-AML1 molecular abnormality. Furthermore, TEL-AML1-positive cells persisted during remission even in the absence of detectable clone-specific IgH and TCR markers. We demonstrate that the TEL-AML1 translocation can occur in vivo during B-cell development before rearrangement of the IgH and TCR genes. We propose, in some cases, that the TEL-AML1 translocation occurs in a stem or B progenitor cell, and that recurrent TEL-AML1-positive pre-B ALL represents a de novo-transformed population that retains the same diagnostic initiating event.","['Pine, Sharon R', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Jayabose, S', 'Sandoval, Claudio']","['Pine SR', 'Wiemels JL', 'Jayabose S', 'Sandoval C']","[""Children's Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Pediatric, Hematology-Oncology, New York Medical College, Basic Science Building, Room 401, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA. sharon_pine@nymc.edu""]",['eng'],['R01-CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chronology as Topic', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence']",,2003/01/16 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/01/16 04:00'],"['2003/01/16 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602001832 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00183-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Feb;27(2):155-64. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00183-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that mevastatin kills certain AML cell lines and is more toxic to a majority of primary AML cell samples than to myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) samples from normal donors, and that mevastatin can produce more than additive kill with standard chemotherapeutics.

The presumed source of MDS is a genetically injured early marrow progenitor cell or pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell. The blood dyscrasias that fall under the broad diagnostic rubric of MDS appear to be quite heterogeneous, which has made it very difficult to construct a coherent, universally applicable MDS classification scheme. A recent re-classification proposal sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) has engendered considerable controversy. Although the precise incidence of MDS is uncertain, it has become clear that MDS is at least as common as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). There is considerable overlap between these two conditions, and the former often segues into the latter; indeed, the distinction between AML and MDS can be murky, and some have argued that the current definitions are arbitrary. Despite the discovery of several tantalizing pathophysiological clues, the basic biology of MDS is incompletely understood. Treatment at present is generally frustrating and ineffective, and except for the small subset of patients who exhibit mild marrow dysfunction and low-risk cytogenetic lesions, the overall prognosis remains rather grim.

However, it has not been possible to transfect these neurons by conventional techniques, and this has been a major impediment to molecular investigations of neuronal gene expression in this system. Here, reporter plasmids were transferred into the nuclei of cultured sympathetic neurons by microinjection. We developed and improved this procedure and were able to measure the transcriptional activities of two coinjected promoters in small groups of neurons, and even from a single neuron. Promoter activities can thus be quantified and normalized relative to that of a constitutively expressed promoter, allowing correction for variability in the injection and assay procedures. High and low promoter activities can be reliably quantified. Importantly, this method can be used not only for reporter plasmids but also for DNA fragments containing only a promoter and reporter gene without any vector sequence that might interfere with promoter. Using this approach, we measured neuronal promoter activities and found that one promoter region of the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase was up-regulated by more than sevenfold by leukemia inhibitory factor. This method thus provides the means to investigate the function of neuronal genes and the mechanisms that regulate their transcription in cultured sympathetic neurons.","['Pajak, Fabrice', 'De Gois, Stephanie', 'Houhou, Leila', 'Vedrine, Christophe', 'Mallet, Jacques', 'Berrard, Sylvie']","['Pajak F', 'De Gois S', 'Houhou L', 'Vedrine C', 'Mallet J', 'Berrard S']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire de la Neurotransmission et des Processus Neurodegeneratifs, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 7091, Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,['EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)'],IM,"['Adrenergic Fibers/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coleoptera', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects/*physiology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plasmids/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*physiology']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.10490 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2003 Feb 1;71(3):365-74. doi: 10.1002/jnr.10490.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IkappaB family has the ability to retain the NF-kappaB in an inactive complex in the cytoplasm. Recently, mutations of the IkappaBalpha gene were found in Hodgkin's lymphoma, which allows NF-kappaB proteins to translocate into the nucleus in an active form. In this report, we describe a mutational analysis of IkappaBalpha for primary tumor cells obtained from patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, hairy cell leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma) as well as 15 leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma cell lines (HL60, U937, HEL, K562, NALM1, Jurkat, JM, MOLT4, Raji, KS1, OKM2T, OKM3T, F6T, Su9T01, and C2-2). RT-PCR, followed by direct sequencing, was performed and all samples expressed IkappaBalpha. One missense mutation was identified in a primary effusion lymphoma cell line, KS1. However, NF-kappaB (p65) protein was absent from the nucleus of KS1 immunohistochemically, suggesting that the mutation did not alter the function of IkappaBalpha in this case. Taken together, although it is not clear whether normal IkappaBalpha protein was expressed in hematologic malignancies, mutations of IkappaBalpha could be rare events in these diseases, except for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Alterations of other members of NF-kappaB/ IkappaB family proteins might act on the development of hematologic malignancies.","['Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Machino, Tatsuya', 'Itoh, Takeysohi', 'Hashimoto, Shu', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Sawada, Umihiko', 'Hayakawa, Satoshi', 'Yamamoto, Tatsuo', 'Horie, Takashi']","['Hatta Y', 'Arima N', 'Machino T', 'Itoh T', 'Hashimoto S', 'Takeuchi J', 'Sawada U', 'Hayakawa S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Horie T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division 1, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan. yhatta@med.nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 Feb;11(2):239-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous efforts to exploit the ability of antibodies to focus the activities of toxic payloads at tumor sites are under way and show early promise.

Depending upon cell type, infection of cells in tissue culture cells can result in either lytic replication, persistence, or latency. The cellular factors that mediate foamy virus (FV) latency are poorly understood. In this study we show that the only known inhibitor of FV replication, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), which binds the FV transactivator (Tas), does not play an important role in FV latency in vitro. We found no significant differences in PML levels in cells that supported lytic replication compared to those that were latently infected. Furthermore, endogenous PML levels did not change following exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which induces FV replication. We demonstrated that FV replication proceeded in the presence of substantial levels of PML, both in fully permissive cells and during reactivation of latent FV. Endogenous PML did not efficiently colocalize with Tas, even after upregulation by alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment.

This mutant protein strongly transactivated the long terminal repeat of BLV and was also able to transactivate the cellular proto-oncogene c-fos. This finding suggested that BLV that encode the mutant protein might propagate and induce lymphoma more efficiently than wild-type BLV. To characterize the effects of the strong transactivation activity of the mutant Tax protein, we constructed an infectious molecular clone of BLV that encoded D247G and examined the replication and propagation of the virus in vitro and in vivo. Cultured cells were transfected with the wild-type and mutant BLV, and then levels of viral proteins and particles and the propagation of viruses were compared. As expected, in vitro, mutant BLV produced more viral proteins and particles and was transmitted very effectively. We injected the wild-type and mutant BLV into sheep, which are easily infected with BLV, and monitored the proportion of BLV-positive cells in the blood and the expression of BLV RNA for 28 weeks. By contrast to the results of our analyses in vitro, we found no significant difference in the viral load or the expression of viral RNA between sheep inoculated with wild-type or mutant BLV. Our observations indicate that the mutant D247G Tax protein does not enhance the expansion of BLV and that there might be a dominant mechanism for regulation of the expression of BLV in vivo.","['Tajima, Shigeru', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Yin, Shan Ai', 'Watarai, Shinobu', 'Tanaka, Yoshimasa', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Okada, Kosuke', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Tajima S', 'Takahashi M', 'Takeshima SN', 'Konnai S', 'Yin SA', 'Watarai S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Onuma M', 'Okada K', 'Aida Y']","['Retrovirus Research Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Sheep', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Viral Load']",PMC140974,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.3.1894-1903.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Feb;77(3):1894-903. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.3.1894-1903.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms by which p12 functions in these events are still poorly understood. We performed studies to examine the significance of p12 phosphorylation in the viral life cycle. Alanine substitutions were introduced at the potential phosphorylation sites in p12, and the resulting mutants were tested for replication. Mutant viruses with changes at S61 and S78 were severely impaired, whereas the other mutant viruses were viable. S61 was shown to be required for normal levels of phosphorylation of p12 in vivo. These defective mutant viruses showed no apparent alteration to Gag protein processing or reduction in the yield of virions after transient transfection, but the mutants failed to form circular viral DNAs in acutely infected cells. Sequence analysis of revertant clones derived from S(61,65)A mutant virus revealed two classes: one group with a single mutation at a residue adjacent to S61 and another group with mutations introducing new positive charges surrounding S61. In vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling indicated that the rescue of the S(61,65)A mutant virus did not result in a significant increase in the phosphorylation level of p12. Alanine substitutions of an arginine-rich stretch near S61 (at R-66, -68, -70, and -71) resulted in the same phenotype as the S(61,65)A mutant virus.

However, in HeLa cells expressing a 5-LO mutant lacking potential 5-LO phosphorylation sites, removal of Ca2+ caused a prominent loss of 5-LO activity. For Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells, AA failed to activate ERKs, and AA-induced 5-LO product formation was only minute. Also, activation of ERKs by phorbol esters did not lead to prominent 5-LO product synthesis. Instead, 5-LO activation in MM6 cells required Ca2+ or alternative signaling pathways induced by hyperosmotic stress.

These cells can elicit strong allogeneic T cell responses as well as induce tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, suggesting that they effectively present tumor-associated antigens. In contrast, they drive primary T cells toward apoptosis mediated in a tumor-specific way by a Fas-FasL interaction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). All patients in the three arms received chest wall irradiation at the end of the third cycle. RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively.

Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10).

Although this prognostic system has substantial predictive power in MDS, further refinement is necessary, especially as far as lower-risk patients are concerned. Histologic parameters, which have long proved to be associated with outcome, are promising candidates to improve the prognostic accuracy of the IPSS. Therefore, we assessed the additional predictive power of the presence of abnormally localized immature precursors (ALIPs) and CD34 immunoreactivity in bone marrow (BM) biopsies of MDS patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic, morphologic, and clinical data of 184 MDS patients, all from a single institution, were collected, with special emphasis on the determinants of the IPSS score. BM biopsies of 173 patients were analyzed for the presence of ALIP, and CD34 immunoreactivity was assessable in 119 patients. Forty-nine patients received intensive therapy. RESULTS: The presence of ALIP and CD34 immunoreactivity significantly improved the prognostic value of the IPSS, with respect to overall as well as leukemia-free survival, in particular within the lower-risk categories. In contrast to the IPSS, both histologic parameters also were predictive of outcome within the group of intensively treated MDS patients. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the importance of histopathologic evaluation in MDS and indicate that determining the presence of ALIP and an increase in CD34 immunostaining in addition to the IPSS score could lead to an improved prognostic subcategorization of MDS patients.","['Verburgh, E', 'Achten, R', 'Maes, B', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Boogaerts, M', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Verhoef, G']","['Verburgh E', 'Achten R', 'Maes B', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Boogaerts M', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Verhoef G']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospitals, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. estelle.verburgh@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.182 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 15;21(2):273-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also assessed the clinical significance of the recently introduced World Health Organization (WHO) classification for AML, which proposed dysplasia as a new parameter for classification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed prospectively 614 patients with de novo AML, all of whom were diagnosed by central morphologic analysis and treated within the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG)-92 or the AMLCG-acute promyalocytic leukemia study. RESULTS: Patients with AML M3, M3v, or M4eo demonstrated a better outcome compared with all other FAB subtypes (P <.001); no prognostic difference was observed among other FAB subtypes. The presence or absence of dysplasia failed to demonstrate prognostic relevance. Other prognostic markers, such as age, cytogenetics, presence of Auer rods, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at diagnosis, all showed significant impact on overall and event-free survival in univariate analyses (P <.001 for all parameters tested). However, in a multivariate analysis, only cytogenetics (unfavorable or favorable), age, and high LDH maintained their prognostic impact. Dysplasia was not found to be an independent prognostic parameter, but the detection of trilineage dysplasia correlated with unfavorable cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that cytomorphology and classification according to FAB criteria are still necessary for the diagnosis of AML but have no relevance for prognosis in addition to cytogenetics. Our results suggest that the WHO classification should be further developed by using cytogenetics as the main determinant of biology. Dysplastic features, in particular, have no additional impact on predicting prognosis when cytogenetics are taken into account.","['Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Loffler, Helmut', 'Gassmann, Winfried', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Wuchter, Christian', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Staib, Peter', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Kubica, Uschi', 'Eimermacher, Hartmut', 'Balleisen, Leopold', 'Gruneisen, Andreas', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Karow, Jochen', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Haferlach T', 'Schoch C', 'Loffler H', 'Gassmann W', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Fonatsch C', 'Ludwig WD', 'Wuchter C', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Staib P', 'Reichle A', 'Kubica U', 'Eimermacher H', 'Balleisen L', 'Gruneisen A', 'Haase D', 'Aul C', 'Karow J', 'Lengfelder E', 'Wormann B', 'Heinecke A', 'Sauerland MC', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Grosshadern, Munich, Germany. torsten.haferlach@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.08.005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 15;21(2):256-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.08.005.,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Aug 1;21(15):3004; author reply 3004-5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,021 patients were retrospectively evaluated according to initial central nervous system (CNS) status. Patients were classified as follows: CNS1 (CNS negative, n = 1,605), CNS2 (< or = 5 WBC/ micro L CSF with blasts, n = 103), CNS3 (CNS positive, n = 58), TLP+ (TLP with blasts, n = 135), or TLP- (TLP without blasts, n = 111). Patients with CNS2 and TLP+ status were eligible for two additional doses of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX). CNS3 patients received additional IT MTX and cranial irradiation (18 Gy). RESULTS: CNS2, CNS3, and TLP+ groups contained a higher percentage of patients with unfavorable characteristics. Cox regression analysis identified TLP+ and CNS3 status as prognostically significant (CNS3): risk ratio (RR) = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 3.6; P =.0005; TLP+: RR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.2; P =.04. Overall 5-year event-free survival (EFS) is 79%, for CNS1 it is 80%, and for TLP- it is 83%. CNS2 patients have an EFS of 80%, but the cumulative incidence of relapses with CNS involvement is higher compared with CNS1 patients (0.10 v 0.04). TLP+ patients have a significantly reduced EFS (73%, P =.003) because of an increased incidence of CNS relapses. CNS3 patients suffer from more systemic and CNS relapses (EFS 50%). CONCLUSION: CNS2 patients have the same prognosis as patients with CNS1 status, whereas the EFS of TLP+ patients is inferior to CNS1 but superior to CNS3 patients (P =.001). Both subgroups may have benefitted from additional IT MTX.","['Burger, Britta', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Mann, Georg', 'Kuhl, Joachim', 'Loning, Lutz', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Burger B', 'Zimmermann M', 'Mann G', 'Kuhl J', 'Loning L', 'Riehm H', 'Reiter A', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. buerger.britta@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/mortality', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.096 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 15;21(2):184-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.096.,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 15;21(2):179-81.

We have characterized the key regulatory steps in the development of multidrug resistance in K562 myelogenous leukemic cells. Unexpectedly, up-regulation of MDR1 levels was not due to transcriptional activation but was achieved at two distinct post-transcriptional steps, mRNA turnover and translational regulation. The short-lived (half-life 1 h) MDR1 mRNA of naive cells (not exposed to drugs) was stabilized (half-life greater than 10 h) following short-term drug exposure. However, this stabilized mRNA was not associated with translating polyribosomes and did not direct P-glycoprotein synthesis. Selection for drug resistance, by long-term exposure to drug, led to resistant lines in which the translational block was overcome such that the stabilized mRNA was translated and P-glycoprotein expressed. The absence of a correlation between steady-state MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein levels was not restricted to K562 cells but was found in other lymphoid cell lines. These findings have implications for the avoidance or reversal of multidrug resistance in the clinic.","['Yague, Ernesto', 'Armesilla, Angel L', 'Harrison, Georgina', 'Elliott, James', 'Sardini, Alessandro', 'Higgins, Christopher F', 'Raguz, Selina']","['Yague E', 'Armesilla AL', 'Harrison G', 'Elliott J', 'Sardini A', 'Higgins CF', 'Raguz S']","['Medical Research Council Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211093200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32514-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 21;278(12):10344-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211093200.

To map the molecular determinants mediating the C2 domain-dependent translocation of PKCalpha to the plasma membrane, full-length native protein and several point mutants in the Ca(2+)/phosphatidylserine-binding site were tagged with green fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Substitution of several aspartate residues by asparagine completely abolished Ca(2+)-dependent membrane targeting of PKCalpha. Strikingly, these mutations enabled the mutant proteins to translocate in a diacylglycerol-dependent manner, suggesting that neutralization of charges in the Ca(2+) binding region enables the C1 domain to bind diacylglycerol. In addition, it was demonstrated that the protein residues involved in direct interactions with acidic phospholipids play differential and pivotal roles in the membrane targeting of the enzyme. These findings provide new information on how the C2 domain-dependent membrane targeting of PKCalpha occurs in the presence of physiological stimuli.","['Bolsover, Stephen R', 'Gomez-Fernandez, Juan C', 'Corbalan-Garcia, Senena']","['Bolsover SR', 'Gomez-Fernandez JC', 'Corbalan-Garcia S']","['Department of Physiology, University College London, Gower St., United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*enzymology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/15 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/01/15 04:00'],"['2003/01/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212145200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32506-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 21;278(12):10282-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212145200.

Despite the frequency of comorbid medical illness in patients with medically inoperable NSCLC, lung cancer progression is the major cause of morbidity and death. Although expectations for cure are reduced compared to good-risk patients (eg, adequate pulmonary reserve), modest long-term survival rates of patients have been reported, after definitive therapy. A comparison of radiotherapy and limited resection is difficult because of the lack of randomized data and the selection bias inherent in retrospective reports. For example, patients treated with surgery have peripheral lesions, undergoing rigorous staging compared to patients treated with radiotherapy. In a multidisciplinary thoracic program, patients are counseled on the options of sublobar resection and conformal radiotherapy. The efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy, after limited resection, in reducing local recurrence in patients with medically inoperable NSCLC is unclear. However, adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered if a postoperative target volume can be defined, particularly if resection margins are narrow. Considering the benefit of chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced disease, combination therapy is administered to patients with good performance status and large (eg, > 4 cm) primary lesions, although combined therapy may increase the potential for pulmonary toxicity in patients with baseline pulmonary dysfunction. Prospective data are becoming available to define the value of treatment alternatives for patients with medically inoperable NSCLC. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B completed a phase II study of thoracoscopic wedge resection and postoperative radiotherapy, whereas a phase I trial of dose-intensive accelerated conformal radiotherapy is ongoing. Trials involving systemic therapy for patients with medically inoperable NSCLC should be developed.","['Bogart, Jeffrey A', 'Scalzetti, Ernest', 'Dexter, Elisabeth']","['Bogart JA', 'Scalzetti E', 'Dexter E']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Upstate Medical University, 750 E.

However, the utility of ES cells as a developmental model or as a source of defined cell populations for pharmaceutical screening or transplantation is compromised because their differentiation in vitro is poorly controlled. Specification of primary lineages is not understood and consequently differentiation protocols are empirical, yielding variable and heterogeneous outcomes. Here we report that neither multicellular aggregation nor coculture is necessary for ES cells to commit efficiently to a neural fate. In adherent monoculture, elimination of inductive signals for alternative fates is sufficient for ES cells to develop into neural precursors. This process is not a simple default pathway, however, but requires autocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Using flow cytometry quantitation and recording of individual colonies, we establish that the bulk of ES cells undergo neural conversion. The neural precursors can be purified to homogeneity by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or drug selection. This system provides a platform for defining the molecular machinery of neural commitment and optimizing the efficiency of neuronal and glial cell production from pluripotent mammalian stem cells.","['Ying, Qi-Long', 'Stavridis, Marios', 'Griffiths, Dean', 'Li, Meng', 'Smith, Austin']","['Ying QL', 'Stavridis M', 'Griffiths D', 'Li M', 'Smith A']","[""Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"[""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Ectoderm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neuroglia/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology']",,2003/01/14 04:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/01/14 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nbt780 [doi]', 'nbt780 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2003 Feb;21(2):183-6. doi: 10.1038/nbt780.

Because the cytoskeleton mesh acts as a barrier to lateral mobility of membrane proteins, we expected that diffusion of membrane proteins in alpha-spectrin-deficient MEL cells would differ greatly from that in normal MEL cells. In the event, diffusion coefficients derived from either FRAP or SPT analysis were similar for alpha-spectrin-deficient and normal MEL cells, differing by a factor of approximately 2, on three different timescales: tens of seconds, 1-10 s, and 100 ms. SPT analysis showed that the diffusion of most class I MHC molecules was confined on both cell types. On the normal MEL cells, the mean diagonal length of the confined area was 330 nm with a mean residency time of 40s. On the alpha-spectrin-deficient MEL cells, the mean diagonal length was 650 nm with a mean residency time of 45s. Thus there are fewer barriers to lateral diffusion on cytoskeleton mutant MEL cells than on normal MEL cells, but this difference does not strongly affect lateral diffusion on the scales measured here.","['Tang, Qing', 'Edidin, Michael']","['Tang Q', 'Edidin M']","['Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218-2685, USA.']",['eng'],['GM58554/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Microscopy, Video/*methods', 'Motion', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Spectrin/deficiency', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/metabolism']",PMC1302621,2003/01/14 04:00,2003/07/31 05:00,['2003/01/14 04:00'],"['2003/01/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(03)74860-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74860-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2003 Jan;84(1):400-7. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74860-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A conditioning regimen that included rabbit ATG, 7.5 to 15 mg/kg (Thymoglobuline; Sangstat, Lyon, France), was given to 102 patients, whereas a conditioning regimen without ATG was given to 58 patients. The median patient age was 34 years for the ATG group and 29 years for the non-ATG group (P = .002); otherwise the 2 groups were matched for disease phase, diagnosis, donor age, interval from diagnosis to transplantation, and number of cells infused at the time of transplant. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 4.5 years (range, l.5-9 years). The conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) in 95 patients and CY-thiotepa in 65 patients; the source of stem cells was bone marrow for all patients. Acute GVHD grades II-IV and grades III-IV were reduced in patients receiving ATG compared to patients not receiving ATG (51% versus 74%, P = .004 and 14% versus 28%, P = .03, respectively). There were significantly fewer patients with chronic GVHD in the ATG group than in the non-ATG group at 6 months (14% versus 30%, P = .03), 1 year (7% versus 41%, P = .0001), 2 years (16% versus 36%, P = .02), and 4 years (5% versus 34%, P = .002) and beyond 4 years (0% in 19 patients at risk versus 29% in 24 patients at risk, P = .01). More patients in the ATG group than in the non-ATG group had a performance status (Karnowski score) greater than 90 at last follow-up (93% versus 56%, P = .01) and had discontinued cyclosporin treatment 2 years posttransplant (28% versus 3%, P = .003). Survival rates were comparable in the ATG and non-ATG groups for patients who received TBI (56% versus 59%, P = .7) and those who received thiotepa (33% versus 18%, P = .3). Transplant mortality and relapse rates were also comparable in the 2 groups for these patients. We conclude that pretransplant ATG administration reduces the risk of acute and chronic GVHD, improves quality of life, and increases the likelihood that discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy will be possible.","['Bacigalupo, A', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Bregante, S', 'Raiola, A M', 'Di Grazia, C', 'Dominietto, A', 'Bruno, B', 'Galbusera, V', 'Frassoni, F', 'Podesta, M', 'Tedone, E', 'Occhini, D', 'Van Lint, M T']","['Bacigalupo A', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Bregante S', 'Raiola AM', 'Di Grazia C', 'Dominietto A', 'Bruno B', 'Galbusera V', 'Frassoni F', 'Podesta M', 'Tedone E', 'Occhini D', 'Van Lint MT']","['Divisione Ematologia II Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy. apbacigalupo@smartino.ge.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rabbits', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/methods']",,2003/01/14 04:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2003/01/14 04:00'],"['2003/01/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.abbmt080656 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(12):656-61. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.abbmt080656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the elimination of fluctuations of chromosome territories in nuclear volume, it was found that genetic elements in most cases adhered to their territories. The investigated genetic elements of HSA 11 were found close to each other relative to the large molecular lengths among them. This finding indicates a higher degree of chromatin condensation of at least a part of HSA 11 compared with HSA 22. In general, there is no correlation between the physical and molecular distance of two loci of the same chromosome territory. The topographical parameters of the EWSR1 and FLI1 genes do not differ substantially for G(0)-lymphocytes, stimulated lymphocytes and Ewing sarcoma cells. The fusion genes pertaining to both derivative chromosomes 11 and 22 in Ewing sarcoma cell nuclei are shifted to the midway position between the native EWSR1 and FLI1 genes. Comparing results obtained for the EWSR1/FLI1 and ABL1/BCR genes in samples of patients suffering from Ewing sarcoma or chronic myelogenous leukaemia, it can be concluded that the mean positions of the fusion genes are determined by the final structure of the chimeric chromosomes and do not depend on the location of the translocation event.","['Taslerova, Renata', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Lukasova, Emilie', 'Jirsova, Pavla', 'Bartova, Eva', 'Kozubek, Michal']","['Taslerova R', 'Kozubek S', 'Lukasova E', 'Jirsova P', 'Bartova E', 'Kozubek M']","['Laboratory of Optical Microscopy, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Botanicka 68a, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus', 'Centromere/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*genetics', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2002/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00439-002-0847-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 2003 Feb;112(2):143-55. doi: 10.1007/s00439-002-0847-7.

A proportion of cells from JMML mononuclear cells (MNC) spontaneously differentiate in vitro into dendritic cells (DC). We have studied MNC from 14 JMML patients, and characterized their functional activity as antigen presenting cells (APC). Large cells, differentiated after seven days of culture, expressed high levels of MHC II molecules and Mannose Receptor, variable levels of CD80 and CD86, and low levels of CD1a. Similar to immature DC, cells from JMML had high levels of dextran endocytosis, and were able to elicit proliferation of allogeneic T lymphocytes in mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). CD40L-matured DC from JMML was associated with relevant increase of CD80, CD86 and CD83, increased APC activity, responded in chemotaxis assays to MIP-3beta and secreted increased amounts of macrophage derived chemokine (MDC). Immature DC and CD40L-matured DC from JMML produced very low amounts of IL-12, whereas the production of IL-10 was higher than normal DC. In line with these findings, they showed defective capacity to polarize naive T cells to differentiate into Th1 effectors. These results indicate that MNC from JMML are committed to spontaneously differentiate into DC with morphological and phenotypical characteristics similar to normal DC. The cytokine profile produced by these APC is likely to suppress and not to elicit a protective immune response.","['Longoni, Daniela', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Bernasconi, Sergio', 'Vulcano, Marisa', 'Onnis, Patrizia', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Allavena, Paola', 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Longoni D', ""D'Amico G"", 'Gaipa G', 'Bernasconi S', 'Vulcano M', 'Onnis P', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Allavena P', 'Biondi A']","['Clinica Pediatrica-Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Osp.

The treatment was conducted according to standard dosage and schedule and the patient did not experience any severe side effect. A progressive reduction of transfusions and a certain recovery of bone marrow cellularity was observed after six months from the end of therapy.

Multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization provided additional information in two patients with a complex karyotype, but failed to detect a telomeric translocation in one patient. Eight patients with normal G-banded karyotypes appeared normal by M-FISH. These results demonstrate that both CGH and M-FISH analysis correlate well with the G-banded karyotype in AML.

However, the prognostic value of FLT3/ITD in various cytogenetic risk groups is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance in patients with de novo AML and a normal karyotype or a t(15;17), t(8;21) or inv(16) (good risk group). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic samples of 100 patients were investigated by single-step PCR of exons 11 and 12 of the FLT3 gene in a single center retrospective analysis. Subgroups included 53 patients with normal karyotype, 21 patients with t(15;17), 9 patients with t(8;21) and 17 patients with inv(16). RESULTS: FLT3/ITD was found in 26 out of 100 patients: 30% of patients with a normal karyotype and 38% of t(15;17) patients tested positive. The complete remission (CR) rates for the ITD(+) or ITD(-) groups were 50 vs 76% in normal karyotypes, and 100 vs 53% in t(15;17) patients, while the relapse rates were 75 vs 25% in normal karyotypes and 50 vs 42% in t(15;17) patients. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) at 5 years were significantly different in patients with normal cytogenetics: ITD(+) vs ITD(-): OS 6 vs 28% (P<0.003); DFS 13 vs 41% (P<0.02) Interestingly, FLT3/ITD had no significant effect on the outcome of t(15;17) patients: ITD(+) vs ITD(-): OS 85 vs 53% (P=0.056), DFS 45 vs 60% (P=0.6) at 50 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a high prognostic value of FLT3/ITD in patients with normal cytogenetics.

The HA-2 induced CTLs used different TCRBV. In contrast, the development of HA-1 specific CTLs coincided with prominent skewing of TCRBV7 spectratypes. Sequencing of the TCRBV7 specific PCR products used by these ex vivo generated HA-1 CTLs revealed the exclusive usage of TCRBV7-9*03, identical to the TCRBV used by HA-1 specific CTLs induced in vivo after stem cell transplantation. Thus, monitoring of immunotherapy with HA-1 specific CTLs is now also feasible by TCRBV spectratyping.","['Verdijk, Rob M', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Wilke, Martina', 'Pool, Jos', 'Schrama, Ellen', 'Brand, Anneke', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Verdijk RM', 'Mutis T', 'Wilke M', 'Pool J', 'Schrama E', 'Brand A', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. rmverdijk@lumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (HA-2 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2002/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2002/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200197 [doi]', '6200197 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(6):271-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its aim is to supercede all existing classification systems, including the Revised European American Classification (REAL), and the organ-based classification of cutaneous lymphoma proposed in 1997 by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) cutaneous lymphoma project group. This article compares the REAL, EORTC, and WHO classifications with particular reference to cutaneous lymphoma. It identifies those entities that have been adopted from the EORTC classification, and illustrates important new entities in the category of cytotoxic T-/NK-cell lymphomas that characteristically present in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. However, WHO is not an organ-based classification and some categories (eg follicular B-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma) include both cutaneous and systemic diseases, and these may have very different prognoses. It is, therefore, important that cancer registries are capable of recording sites of involvement for both B- and T-cell lymphomas so that the incidence and prognosis of cutaneous lymphomas can be established from national data sets in future years.","['Russell-Jones, Robin']",['Russell-Jones R'],"[""Skin Tumor Unit, St John's Institute of Dermatology, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*classification', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification', 'Skin Neoplasms/*classification', 'World Health Organization']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1067/mjd.2003.45 [doi]', 'S0190-9622(03)50017-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2003 Jan;48(1):93-102. doi: 10.1067/mjd.2003.45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an understanding of these dynamic cellular processes at the molecular level requires the ability to assess changes in the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation across numerous proteins simultaneously as well as over time. Here we describe a sensitive approach based on multidimensional liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry that enables the rapid identification of numerous sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of different proteins from human whole cell lysates. We used this methodology to follow changes in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns that occur over time during either the activation of human T cells or the inhibition of the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion product in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in response to treatment with STI571 (Gleevec). Together, these experiments rapidly identified 64 unique sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on 32 different proteins. Half of these sites have been documented in the literature, validating the merits of our approach, whereas motif analysis suggests that a number of the undocumented sites are also potentially involved in biological pathways. This methodology should enable the rapid generation of new insights into signaling pathways as they occur in states of health and disease.","['Salomon, Arthur R', 'Ficarro, Scott B', 'Brill, Laurence M', 'Brinker, Achim', 'Phung, Qui T', 'Ericson, Christer', 'Sauer, Karsten', 'Brock, Ansgar', 'Horn, David M', 'Schultz, Peter G', 'Peters, Eric C']","['Salomon AR', 'Ficarro SB', 'Brill LM', 'Brinker A', 'Phung QT', 'Ericson C', 'Sauer K', 'Brock A', 'Horn DM', 'Schultz PG', 'Peters EC']","['Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, 10675 John Jay Hopkins Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",PMC141014,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.2436191100 [doi]', '2436191100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jan 21;100(2):443-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2436191100.

Maternal, paternal, and child factors not known to be associated with leukemia as well as factors possibly associated were selected for analysis. Most factors were taken directly from parental interviews, but two factors related to parental occupational exposures were blindly coded by chemists. Hospital and population controls were compared using odds ratios estimated from logistic regression. Cases were compared with both types of controls with the same statistical method. Prevalence data from ongoing population surveys were compared with reported prevalence in controls. From the former comparisons and the distribution of socioeconomic variables, results suggested that study groups came from the same base population. Nevertheless, reported and coded exposures among hospital controls were closer to those of cases than to those of population controls.

The half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) for B-CLL cells was 380 +/- 60 microM (n = 5). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk completely blocked acadesine-induced apoptosis, which involved the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and cytochrome c release. Incubation of B-CLL cells with acadesine induced the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating that it is activated by acadesine. Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI), a nucleoside transport inhibitor, 5-iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase, and adenosine completely inhibited acadesine-induced apoptosis and AMPK phosphorylation, demonstrating that incorporation of acadesine into the cell and its subsequent phosphorylation to AICA ribotide (ZMP) are necessary to induce apoptosis. Inhibitors of protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinases did not protect from acadesine-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Moreover, acadesine had no effect on p53 levels or phosphorylation, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism in apoptosis triggering. Normal B lymphocytes were as sensitive as B-CLL cells to acadesine-induced apoptosis. However, T cells from patients with B-CLL were only slightly affected by acadesine at doses up to 4 mM. AMPK phosphorylation did not occur in T cells treated with acadesine. Intracellular levels of ZMP were higher in B-CLL cells than in T cells when both were treated with 0.5 mM acadesine, suggesting that ZMP accumulation is necessary to activate AMPK and induce apoptosis. These results suggest a new pathway involving AMPK in the control of apoptosis in B-CLL cells and raise the possibility of using acadesine in B-CLL treatment.","['Campas, Clara', 'Lopez, Jose Manuel', 'Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Barragan, Montserrat', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Gil, Joan']","['Campas C', 'Lopez JM', 'Santidrian AF', 'Barragan M', 'Bellosillo B', 'Colomer D', 'Gil J']","[""Unitat de Bioquimica, Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, E-08907 L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '24386-93-4 (5-iodotubercidin)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tubercidin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2339 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50754-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3674-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2339.

Treatment (24 hours) of wild-type cells with paclitaxel (eg, 5 to 20 nM) in combination with 10 nM bryostatin 1 induced a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (eg, cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO [second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low pI] release), caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and apoptosis; moreover, bryostatin 1 circumvented the block to paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis conferred by ectopic expression of the loop-deleted protein. Coadministration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) soluble receptors, or ectopic expression of CrmA or dominant-negative caspase-8, abrogated potentiation of paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis by bryostatin 1, implicating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in this process. Similar events occurred in HL-60 leukemia cells. Potentiation of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in wild-type and mutant cells by bryostatin 1 was associated with increases in TNF-alpha mRNA and protein and was mimicked by exogenous TNF-alpha. Coadministration of the selective PKC inhibitor GFX (1 microM) blocked the increase in TNF-alpha mRNA levels and apoptosis in bryostatin 1/paclitaxel-treated cells. Lastly, synchronization of cells in G(2)M increased their sensitivity to TNF-alpha-associated lethality. Collectively, these findings indicate that in U937 cells, bryostatin 1 promotes paclitaxel-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, and circumvents resistance to cell death conferred by loss of the Bcl-2 phosphorylation domain, through the PKC-dependent induction of TNF-alpha. They further suggest that this process is amplified by paclitaxel-mediated arrest of cells in G(2)M, where they are more susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced lethality.","['Wang, Shujie', 'Wang, Zhiliang', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Wang S', 'Wang Z', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63785/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Bryostatins', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2739 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50751-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3648-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2739.

Since members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors recognize and bind to similar DNA-binding motifs, it has been difficult to elucidate the specific role of each of the C/EBP family members in eliciting myeloid gene expression. In order to address this issue, we focused on the expression of the lactoferrin (LF) gene. LF expression is transcriptionally regulated in a C/EBP-dependent manner in myeloid cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha binds to the LF promoter in nonexpressing cells. Upon induction of maturation, C/EBP epsilon binds to the LF promoter, which correlates with LF expression. Lack of LF expression in the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, which harbors the t(15;17) translocation, cannot be correlated with aberrant binding at the C/EBP site in the LF promoter. It is, however, associated with the persistent binding of the silencer CCAAT displacement protein (CDP/cut) to the LF promoter in these cells. We conclude that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP epsilon, and CDP/cut all play definitive roles in regulating late gene expression during normal myeloid development.","['Khanna-Gupta, Arati', 'Zibello, Theresa', 'Sun, Hong', 'Gaines, Peter', 'Berliner, Nancy']","['Khanna-Gupta A', 'Zibello T', 'Sun H', 'Gaines P', 'Berliner N']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],['R01-DK53471/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2767 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50724-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3460-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2767.

Because some chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells can undergo CSR without SHM, it constitutes a useful model to dissect AID function. In this work, we have studied AID expression, the presence of mutations in the preswitch mu DNA region, CSR, and the SHM in 65 CLL patients. Our results demonstrate that unmutated CLL B cells can constitutively express AID and that AID expression is associated with the presence of mutations in the preswitch region and in clonally related isotype-switched transcripts. They also demonstrate that in CLL without constitutive AID expression, AID induction on stimulation results in preswitch mutations and the CSR process. Our results show a dissociation between SHM and CSR in CLL and suggest that, in this disease, AID would require additional help for carrying out the SHM process.","['Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Vuillier, Francoise', 'Vasconcelos, Yuri', 'Dumas, Gerard', 'Magnac, Christian', 'Payelle-Brogard, Beatrice', 'Pritsch, Otto', 'Dighiero, Guillaume']","['Oppezzo P', 'Vuillier F', 'Vasconcelos Y', 'Dumas G', 'Magnac C', 'Payelle-Brogard B', 'Pritsch O', 'Dighiero G']","[""Unite d'Immuno-hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase/blood/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/immunology', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Editing/immunology', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Reference Values', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3175 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44454-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4029-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3175.

Described most commonly in immunocompromised patients, infectious esophagitis can also occasionally be discovered in immunocompetent individuals in several unique clinical settings. Evaluation of the typical presenting complaints, such as dysphagia or odynophagia, are especially important in immunocompetent patients, and therapy should be directed at the appropriate predisposing condition and resultant infectious agent. In immunocompromised patients, however, clinical experience supports the use of empiric therapy in patients without concomitant systemic complaints. Especially in AIDS patients or those with lymphoma or leukemia, the initial approach to infectious esophagitis complaints (ie, dysphagia or odynophagia) is to begin an empiric trial of oral systemic fluconazole for presumed candidal esophagitis. If the individual remains symptomatic after 3 to 7 days or has any associated systemic complaints or concerning clinical findings (eg, hematemesis), then upper endoscopy with biopsies is indicated. If an etiologic agent other than Candida is defined by histologic, immunohistochemical, or culture methods, then appropriate therapy can be initiated. There are many important and pathologic agents implicated in infectious esophagitis. Thus, directed therapy needs to be administered appropriately and in a timely fashion to avoid poor short-term problems or long-term sequelae.","['Mulhall, Brian P.', 'Wong, Roy K.

However, xanthine is less soluble than uric acid, and preexisting uric acid is not affected by allopurinol. The enzyme urate oxidase, not present in mammals, converts uric acid to allantoin, which is 5-10 times more soluble than uric acid. A new recombinant form of urate oxidase, rasburicase, has recently been developed. In a phase I/II study of rasburicase in children and young adults with hematological malignancies, rasburicase was demonstrated to be well tolerated at 0.2 mg/kg/day intravenously, had a mean T1/2 of 21.2 +/- 12.0 hours, and induced a median decrease in uric acid from 9.7 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL (P < 0.001). We recently demonstrated, in a randomized prospective trial comparing rasburicase versus allopurinol in children with hematological malignancies at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome, that rasburicase significantly lowered the mean uric acid area under the curve 0 to 96 hours (128 +/- 70 mg/dL/hour vs. 329 +/- 129 mg/dL/hour; P < 0.001) and 4 hours post uric acid by 86% versus 12% (P < 0.001). Furthermore, in the hyperuricemic group, the baseline creatinine level decreased from 144% to 102% by 96 hours following rasburicase compared to an increase from 132% to 147% following allopurinol. Although the difference in effect on creatinine levels is not significant, the study was not designed or powered to question this effect. Lastly, in 510 patients with hematological malignancies at risk for tumor lysis syndrome who received rasburicase, only 2 (0.4%) have developed new renal complications requiring hemodialysis. In summary, in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia, patients with hematological malignancies at risk of tumor lysis syndrome appear to benefit significantly from the use of a recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase).","['Cairo, Mitchell S']",['Cairo MS'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. mc1310@columbia.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Creatinine/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Urate Oxidase/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70163-4 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2002.s.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2002 Dec;3 Suppl 1:S26-31. doi: 10.3816/clm.2002.s.012.,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic utility and critical analysis of data.,42-8,"CONTEXT: Acute leukemia displays characteristic patterns of surface antigen expression (CD antigens), which facilitate their identification and proper classification and hence play an important role in instituting proper treatment plans. In addition to enzyme cytochemical analysis, multiparameter flow cytometric analysis has become commonplace in most laboratories for that purpose. The essential role and caveats of flow cytometry in that regard, however, have received little scrutiny. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of commonly used immunomarkers and patterns in various acute leukemias to help define the best use and role of multiparameter flow cytometry in the diagnosis and proper classification of acute leukemias. DESIGN: We have retrospectively analyzed the immunophenotypic data from 508 de novo adult and pediatric acute leukemia patients, as studied using multiparameter flow cytometry in addition to routine morphologic and enzyme cytochemical analysis. Cytogenetic and/or molecular data were correlated in all 41 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and in 203 other cases of acute leukemia where those data were available. We have also determined the positive and negative predictive values of a combined CD34 and HLA-DR expression pattern for the differentiation of APL from other myeloid leukemias. RESULTS: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) other than APL, expression of CD34 was seen in 62% and expression of HLA-DR in 86% of all cases. Twenty-six (10%) of 259 cases of non-APL AML were negative for both CD34 and HLA-DR as opposed to 33 (80%) of 41 cases of APL. None of the cases of APL were positive for both CD34 and HLA-DR in contrast to 149 (58%) of 259 cases of non-APL AML. Fifty-three cases were found to be examples of minimally differentiated AML (AML M0) based on the lack of expression of cytoplasmic CD3 and cytoplasmic CD79a and expression of one or more myelomonocytic-associated antigens and/or myeloperoxidase. Expression of CD20 was seen in 40 (24%) of 168 cases of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL) and 52 (29%) lacked CD34 expression. Five of 180 cases of pB-ALL and 2 cases of precursor T-cell ALL (pT-ALL) were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Aside from cytoplasmic CD3, CD5 and CD7 were the most sensitive antigens present in all 21 cases of pT-ALL. CD33 was more sensitive but less specific than CD13 for myeloid lineage. CONCLUSION: Aside from identification of blasts, flow cytometry was found to be especially useful in the correct identification of AML M0, differentiation of APL from AML M1/M2, and correct identification of TdT-negative ALL and unusual variants, such as transitional B-cell ALL and undifferentiated and biphenotypic acute leukemias.","['Kaleem, Zahid', 'Crawford, Eric', 'Pathan, M Hanif', 'Jasper, Leah', 'Covinsky, Michael A', 'Johnson, Lawrence R', 'White, Glenda']","['Kaleem Z', 'Crawford E', 'Pathan MH', 'Jasper L', 'Covinsky MA', 'Johnson LR', 'White G']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/immunology/metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/immunology/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2003/01/11 04:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2003/01/11 04:00'],"['2003/01/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2003-127-42-FCAOA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2003 Jan;127(1):42-8. doi: 10.5858/2003-127-42-FCAOA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical and pathological features of CVD in patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS OR MATERIALS: In our series of 116 autopsied cases of acute leukemia during the period between January 1978 and December 1998, we had 14 patients who had CVD during the course of acute leukemia. The neuropathological and clinical features of those patients were examined. RESULTS: Neuropathological examination showed hemorrhagic infarction due to disseminated aspergillosis or mucormycosis (5 cases), multiple hemorrhages due to leukemic cell infiltration (2 cases) and a single massive hemorrhage with petechial hemorrhages in various regions of the brain (4 cases). Three patients had CVD due to miscellaneous causes. Clinicopathological correlation revealed that fungal disseminations occurred under agranulocytosis, while leukemic cell infiltration occurred under a marked leukocyotosis (peripheral white blood cell count >100,000/microl). Four patients with coagulopathy, including three with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) had a single massive hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that there were at least three types of CVD with specific clinicopathological features. Hemorrhagic infarction under agranulocyotosis was due to disseminated aspergillosis or mucormycosis. Multiple cerebral hemorrhages under marked leukocyotosis was due to leukemic cell infiltration into the brain.

Different mechanisms of methotrexate resistance has been known in various kinds of leukemias. Because of individualized chemotherapy according to different drug metabolism in different leukemia patients, the treatment became more reasonable and scientific and the treatment effect has been gradually improved. However, there was few report about its drug resistance mechanism in lymphoma. This study was designed to establish Burkitt's lymphoma methotrexate resistant cell strain--Namlwa 12/MTX and study its resistant mechanism. METHODS: Namlwa 12/MTX resistant cell strain was established by repeated impulsed exposure to methotrexate. The difference of the methotrexate effect on Namlwa 12/MTX and Namlwa cell strains were evaluated with MTT method. The level of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mRNA expression was assayed with RT-PCR. The function of the reduced folate carrier (RFC) were tested with 3H-MTX labeling and counted with beta-liquid scintillation counter. The capacity to form the polyglutamate methotrexate (MTXPG) in these cell strains was assayed with 3H-MTX labeling and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation. RESULTS: More than 20 times methotrexate resistance was found in Namalwa 12/MTX cell strain in comparison with the Namalwa cell strain. This resistance was not associated with the dysfunction of the RFC, but was closely associated with the amount of MTXPG formed. The amount of total MTXPG (MTXPG1-6) formed in these 2 cell strains was (1583 +/- 26) pmol/10(9) tumor cells and (4453 +/- 236) pmol/10(9) tumor cells, respectively (P < 0.05), while the amount of long chain MTXPG (MTXPG4-6) formed only accounted for 5.5% and 25.4% of the MTXPG1-6, respectively (P < 0.05). The level of DHFR mRNA expression was gradually increased with the formation of the drug resistance in Namalwa 12/MTX. CONCLUSION: Synthesizing difficulty of MTXPG and over-expression of DHFR mRNA level result in methotrexate resistance in Namalwa 12/MTX cell strain.","['Chen, Jing', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Ying, Da-ming', 'Shen, Min', 'Wu, He-jian']","['Chen J', 'Gu LJ', 'Ying DM', 'Shen M', 'Wu HJ']","[""Shanghai Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200092, P.

Multidrug resistant cell lines are the good models for investigating the mechanisms and reversal of acquired drug resistance. This study was designed to explore the multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms in cell line HL-60/VCR. METHODS: Flow cytometry and a panel of antibodies were used to analyze the expression of MDR proteins (P-gp, MRP, LRP, BCRP, GST-pi) and apoptosis-modulating proteins (bcl-2, bcl-x, bax, bad) in MDR cell line HL-60/VCR and drug sensitive cell line HL-60. RESULTS: The expression levels of MDR proteins (P-gp, MRP, BCRP, GST-pi) were (18.62, 1.19, 1.50, 1.32-flod) higher in HL-60/VCR than in HL-60, while the expression of LRP level was similar.

This study was designed to investigate whether the two novel bcl-2 AS-ODNs could increase Ara-C-induced apoptosis of cultured primary acute leukemia (AL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Cells. METHODS: Cell surviving fraction was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The expression levels of bcl-2 protein were assayed by immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate label. Apoptosis was detected by Giemsa staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with the two AS-ODNs/Ara-C combination respectively for 48 h significantly inhibited the growth of AL and CLL cells. There was significant difference on AL and CLL cells survival between nonsense oligodeoxynucleotide(NS-ODN)/Ara-C combination and Ara-C treated cells alone (P < 0.05). It was found that the two AS-ODNs respectively combined with Ara-C could significantly downregulate bcl-2 protein expression (P < 0.05). There was a significant increase in apoptotic rates of AL or CLL cells after treatment with the two AS-ODNs respectively combined with Ara-C as respectively compared with the NS-ODN/Ara-C combination and Ara-C treated cells alone; and the effect had statistical difference (P < 0.05). Compared to the AS-ODN directed against the translation initiation of bcl-2 mRNA, the AS-ODN directed against the coding region showed stronger effect in the aspects of increasing the sensitivity of AL cells to Ara-C (P < 0.05).

Many researchers have shown that real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the involved transcript is a valuable tool for monitoring APL and its treatment. In addition, some research suggests that identification of a specific breakpoint region may be used to predict an individual's likelihood of relapse and possibly their response to all-trans retinoic acid treatment. We describe the first reported 1-step multiplex RT-PCR assay capable of t(15;17) fusion transcript real-time relative quantitation and simultaneous transcript form identification in 2 reactions. This assay uses a novel dual-probe technique to achieve what has required a laborious procedure of 2 or more reactions followed by postamplification analysis.

In our experiment, we investigated whether YM529 showed an antitumor effect on hematopoietic tumor cell lines other than myeloma, and we compared YM529 with YM175, which had a relatively more potent antitumor effect than that of existing bisphosphonates.

Therefore, it is concluded that further utilization of YM529 can be expected against hematopoietic tumor cells in the future.","['Nishida, Shozo', 'Kikuichi, Shigeru', 'Haga, Hisae', 'Yoshioka, Shohei', 'Tsubaki, Masonobu', 'Fujii, Katsuki', 'Irimajiri, Kiyohiro']","['Nishida S', 'Kikuichi S', 'Haga H', 'Yoshioka S', 'Tsubaki M', 'Fujii K', 'Irimajiri K']","['Kinki University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashi-osaka, Osaka 577-8502, Japan. nishida@phar.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '127657-42-5 (YM 529)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.26.96 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2003 Jan;26(1):96-100. doi: 10.1248/bpb.26.96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both tests were undertaken in 49 adult survivors (aged 16-53.7 yr), who were previously irradiated for non-pituitary brain tumors or leukemia, and 33 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched controls. The aims of the study were to examine the impact of the time interval after irradiation on the pattern of GH responsiveness to the two provocative tests and to establish the role of the GHRH + AST in the diagnosis of radiation-induced GHD. The median (range) peak GH responses to either test were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the patients [GHRH + AST, 19.9 (range, 2.7-103.5) microg/liter; ITT, 5 (0.2-34.8) microg/liter] than in normals [GHRH + AST, 55 (5.7-173.5) microg/liter; ITT, 23.8 (4.2-80) microg/liter]. In patients and normal controls, the median peak GH response to the GHRH + AST was significantly greater (P < 0.0001) than the response to the ITT. However, the ratio of the peak GH response to the GHRH + AST over that achieved with the ITT (discordancy ratio) was significantly higher (P = 0.007) in the patients (median, 3.45; range, 0.8-53.5) compared with normals (median, 2; range, 0.34-18.6), consistent with dominant hypothalamic damage and relatively preserved somatotroph responsiveness. The peak GH response to the ITT fell significantly within 5 yr of irradiation with little further change over the subsequent 10 yr. In contrast, the peak GH response to the GHRH + AST barely changed within 5 yr of irradiation but subsequently declined significantly over the next 10 yr. Thus, the evolution of change in GH responsiveness to the two different stimuli over time was markedly different, resulting in a significantly raised discordancy ratio of 6 within the first 5 postirradiation years, which then normalized over the next 10 yr. The peak GH responses to the GHRH + AST and the discordancy ratio were negatively correlated with the time interval after irradiation (r = -0.40, P = 0.0037; and r = -0.4, P = 0.0046, respectively). On a practical clinical level, the discordancy between the GH test results was important; 50% of those classified as severely GHD patients by the ITT were judged normal or only GH insufficient by the GHRH + AST. In conclusion, these findings suggest that hypothalamic dysfunction occurs early and somatotroph dysfunction occurs late, following radiation damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This time dependency of somatotroph dysfunction may reflect either secondary somatotroph atrophy due to hypothalamic GHRH deficiency or delayed direct radiation-induced damage to the pituitary gland. The high false negative diagnosis rate for severe GHD makes the GHRH + AST an unreliable test in clinical practice when GH status is explored in the early years after cranial irradiation with the intention to treat.","['Darzy, K H', 'Aimaretti, G', 'Wieringa, G', 'Gattamaneni, H Rao', 'Ghigo, E', 'Shalet, S M']","['Darzy KH', 'Aimaretti G', 'Wieringa G', 'Gattamaneni HR', 'Ghigo E', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom M20 4BX.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Insulin)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Arginine', 'Deficiency Diseases/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', '*Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prolactin/blood', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jc.2002-021094 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003 Jan;88(1):95-102. doi: 10.1210/jc.2002-021094.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defective antifolate uptake due to inactivating mutations in the hRFC gene is an established mechanism of drug resistance in various tumor cells. However, while antifolate transport is frequently impaired, either no or only a single hRFC allele is inactivated, suggesting that additional mechanism(s) of resistance are operative. Here we studied the relationship between the expression and function of transcription factors and antifolate resistance in transport-defective leukemia cells that poorly express or completely lack RFC mRNA. Stable transfection with a hRFC expression construct resulted in restoration of normal RFC mRNA expression and nearly wild type drug sensitivity in these antifolate-resistant cells. The loss of RFC gene expression prompted us to explore transcription factor binding to the hRFC promoter. The hRFC promoter contains an upstream GC-box and a downstream cAMP-response element (CRE)/AP-1-like element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and oligonucleotide competition revealed a substantial loss of nuclear factor binding to CRE and GC-box in these drug-resistant cell lines. Consistently, antibody-mediated supershift analysis showed a marked decrease in the binding of CRE-binding protein 1 (CREB-1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) to CRE and GC-box, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed undetectable expression of CREB-1, decreased ATF-1 levels, parental Sp1 levels, and increased levels of the short Sp3 isoforms, recently shown to repress hRFC gene expression. Transient transfections into these antifolate-resistant cells demonstrated a marked loss of GC-box-dependent, and CRE-driven reporter gene activities and introduction of CREB-1 or Sp1 expression constructs resulted in restoration of hRFC mRNA expression. These results establish a novel mechanism of antifolate resistance that is based on altered expression and function of transcription factors resulting in transcriptional silencing of the hRFC promoter.","['Rothem, Lilah', 'Aronheim, Ami', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Rothem L', 'Aronheim A', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, the Rappaport Institute for Research in the Medical Sciences and the B.

OBJECTIVES: To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library using a comprehensive search strategy, date of last search November 2001. Contacted industry and scanned reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were extracted by both authors independently. A random effects model was used unless p>0.10 for the test of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 trials (1,464 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in ten trials and as treatment in two. Seven trials were in acute leukaemia, two in cancer, one in liver transplant patients, one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients, and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin had been compared with placebo in three trials and with fluconazole in nine; the dose varied from 1.5 MIE to 72 MIE daily. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.13). There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (relative risk 0.76, 0.49 to 1.18) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (relative risk 0.37, 0.15 to 0.91) and colonisation (relative risk 0.49, 0.34 to 0.70). The results were very similar if the three studies which were not performed in cancer patients were excluded.

In this study a number of different approaches were used to optimize further the in vitro system. First, the effects of a variety of maturation agents were studied. The addition of TNF-alpha, polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) and LPS to autologous DCs resulted in the emergence of only a small percentage of CD83+ DCs, IFN-alpha having no demonstrable effect. Only the addition of Poly(I:C) to DCs resulted in modestly increased specific cytotoxicity to B-CLL targets, IFN-alpha and LPS having no effect. Secondly, T cells were pretreated with IL-15, prior to culturing with lysate-pulsed autologous DCs. A significant increase in T cell activation (P = 0.038), IFN-gamma secretion (P = 0.030) and specific cytotoxicity to B-CLL targets (P = 0.006) was demonstrated compared to untreated T cells. Thirdly, monocyte derived DCs electrofused with B-CLL B cells were compared with lysate-pulsed DCs. T cells stimulated by fused DCs generated higher levels of specific cytotoxicity to autologous B-CLL B cell targets than those stimulated by lysate pulsed DCs (P = 0.013). Blocking studies demonstrated inhibition of this cytotoxicity by both anti-CD4 (P = 0.062) and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (P = 0.018), suggesting the generation of both HLA class I- and HLA class II-restricted CTL responses. In summary, in vitro B-CLL-specific T cell responses can be enhanced further by preincubating T cells with IL-15 and using autologous fused DC-B-CLL hybrids instead of autologous lysate-pulsed DCs. These preliminary data require confirmation with larger numbers of patients. Such an approach, however, may eventually provide effective immunotherapy for treatment of B-CLL.","['Goddard, R V', 'Prentice, A G', 'Copplestone, J A', 'Kaminski, E R']","['Goddard RV', 'Prentice AG', 'Copplestone JA', 'Kaminski ER']","['Plymouth Postgraduate Medical School, Derriford Combined Laboratory, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, Devon, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Polynucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27380-19-4 (poly(rI).poly(dC))']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Fusion', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Polynucleotides/pharmacology', '*T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",PMC1808593,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['2047 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02047.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2003 Jan;131(1):82-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02047.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that the potential clinical use of LIF, as a neuroprotective agent, in conjunction with chemotherapy will not interfere with the anti-tumour treatment.","[""O'Flaherty, E"", 'Cook, W', 'Boyd, J', 'Grant, S L', 'Kurek, J', 'Begley, C G']","[""O'Flaherty E"", 'Cook W', 'Boyd J', 'Grant SL', 'Kurek J', 'Begley CG']","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia. elizabeth.oflaherty@mh.org.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0897719021000032038 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2002 Sep;20(3):141-5. doi: 10.1080/0897719021000032038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene encoding the beta receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRbeta) was identified as a target of retroviral mutagenesis in mutants selected for interleukin-3 (IL3)-independent growth. Expression of PDGFRbeta in the parental cells using a retroviral vector increased the frequency of factor-independent growth, confirming the significance of the retroviral integration site. Significantly, however, expression of the receptor did not induce IL3-independent growth in one step. In contrast, TEL-PDGFRbeta, the fusion protein generated by the t(5;12) translocation associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, induced factor-independent growth in all transductants, demonstrating that the TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein is a more potent mitogenic signal. Nevertheless PDGFRbeta overexpression is sufficient to give a selective advantage to IL3-dependent cells under adverse conditions, allowing the selection of secondary mutations that impart IL3-independent growth. These results underline the power of insertional mutagenesis to identify subtle but initiating mutations that synergize with other lesions in oncogenic transformation.","['Meyer, Johann', 'Laker, Christine', 'Janzir, Nadia', 'Franz, Marie-Josee', 'Bergholz, Ursula', 'Ostertag, Wolfram', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Meyer J', 'Laker C', 'Janzir N', 'Franz MJ', 'Bergholz U', 'Ostertag W', 'Stocking C']","['Department of Cell- and Virus-Genetics, Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie, Martinistrasse 52, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0897719021000058139 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2002 Sep;20(3):131-40. doi: 10.1080/0897719021000058139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secretion of FGF-2 in the cell culture supernatant was also studied. Expression of mRNA encoding for the above-mentioned FGFs was analyzed by RT-PCR. The production of FGF-2 in the conditioned media of WEHI-3B and SR-4987 cell cultures was evaluated by techniques of affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing and immunoblotting. The biological activity of FGF-2 was checked on SR-4987 cells by a agar clonogenic assay. In both cell lines mRNA was found encoding for FGF-1, FGF-2 and FGF-6 and WEHI-3B cells express also mRNA for FGF-3 (int-2) and FGF-4 (K-FGF/hst). Furthermore, supernatant from WEHI-3B cells was found to stimulate dramatically the agar clonogenicity of SR-4987 cells which have a very poor basal capacity for growth in agar. The clonogenic activity of WEHI-3B conditioned medium is due to FGF-2 secreted into cell culture supernatant whereas SR-4987 cells, although express FGF-2 mRNA, do not seem able to secrete this factor. The expression in myeloid leukemia cells of oncogene-related factors such as FGF-3, FGF-4 and FGF-6 together with the secretion of FGF-2 able to support a positive regulation of bone marrow stromal cells function suggest that FGFs may have an important role in sustaining the leukemogenic process and related disorders.","['Pessina, Augusto', 'Gagliardi, Giuseppina', 'Croera, Cristina', 'Foti, Paola', 'Dassi, Cristina', 'Brambilla, Paolo', 'Neri, Maria Grazia']","['Pessina A', 'Gagliardi G', 'Croera C', 'Foti P', 'Dassi C', 'Brambilla P', 'Neri MG']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Milan, Via Pascal 36, 20133 Milan, Italy. pessinaa@mailserver.unimi.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fgf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 3)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 3', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 6', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/10 04:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2003/01/10 04:00'],"['2003/01/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0897719021000041137 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2002 Sep;20(3):121-9. doi: 10.1080/0897719021000041137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal clinical study was performed involving 57 patients, 10 were the ones with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 32 were the ones with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 15 were the ones with lymphoma. None of the subjects in this study group received treatment or blood transfusion before the study, except the ones diagnosed with relapse of ALL. Forty two healthy children were also selected to form the control group. In order to measure ePKA, blood samples were taken for five times, with 1.5 months apart between each other during the study. Statistical analysis were done by using Wilcoxon's signed rank test, Kruskall-Wallis with Mann-Whitney U Test and Spearman rank correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: The ePKA of the patients with relapse of ALL, and ALL, but not the patients with lymphoma, at the time of diagnosis were found to be lower compared to the one's in the control group (respectively p = 0.001, p = 0.003). The comparison between the first ePKA samples and the third ePKA samples of the patients with both ALL and lymphoma showed a significant increase (respectively p = 0.006, and p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: The measurement of ePKA can be considered for follow-up the neoplastic treatment due to the fact that it is detected to be low in leukemia and relapse of ALL and in normal values after chemotherapy. However, more long-term studies, including more number of cases, are required to be carried out in order to prove the accuracy of this hypothesis.

The primary objective of the Prophylactic Antithrombin Replacement in Kids with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated with Asparaginase (PARKAA) Study was to determine the prevalence of TEs. The secondary objective was to detect any association of TEs with the presence of congenital or acquired prothrombotic disorders. METHODS: Children with ALL were screened for TEs at the end of ASP treatment using bilateral venograms, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiography. Symptomatic TEs were confirmed by appropriate radiographic tests. All tests were read by a blinded central adjudication committee. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 60 children had TEs, a prevalence of 36.7% (95% confidence interval, 24.4-48.8%). TEs were located in the sinovenous system of the brain in 1 patient, the right atrium in 3 patients, and the upper central venous system in 19 patients. TEs detected by venography resulted in 1) 25-100% occlusion, with 1 in 3 patients showing occlusion of > 75% of the greatest vessel dimension, and 2) the presence of collaterals in 60% of patients, with 40% categorized as major. No children with TEs were positive for factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene 20201A, and four of eight children with antiphospholipid antibodies had a TE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TEs is exceedingly high in this population, and it is likely that the extent of occlusion is likely clinically significant. No trend was seen toward an association between TEs and the presence of congenital prothrombotic disorders. A trend was seen toward an association between TEs and antiphospholipid antibodies. Carefully designed clinical trials of primary prophylaxis for the prevention of TEs are required in this patient population.","['Mitchell, Lesley G', 'Andrew, Maureen', 'Hanna, Kim', 'Abshire, Thomas', 'Halton, Jacqueline', 'Anderson, Ron', 'Cherrick, Irene', 'Desai, Sunil', 'Mahoney, Donald', 'McCuster, Patricia', 'Wu, John', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Chait, Peter', 'de Veber, Gabrielle', 'Lee, Kyong-Jin', 'Mikulis, David', 'Ginsberg, Jeffrey', 'Way, Cliford']","['Mitchell LG', 'Andrew M', 'Hanna K', 'Abshire T', 'Halton J', 'Anderson R', 'Cherrick I', 'Desai S', 'Mahoney D', 'McCuster P', 'Wu J', 'Dahl G', 'Chait P', 'de Veber G', 'Lee KJ', 'Mikulis D', 'Ginsberg J', 'Way C']","['Population Health Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lesley.mitchell@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (factor V Leiden)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Antiphospholipid/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antithrombins/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/genetics', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Factor V/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11042 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 15;97(2):508-16. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11042.,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,"['Prophylactic Antithrombin Replacement in Kids with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Treated with Asparaginase Group (PARKAA)']",,,

The authors evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) compared with a combination of fluconazole plus itraconazole (F+I) as prophylaxis in this setting. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML or high-risk MDS who were undergoing initial induction chemotherapy were randomized to receive either F+I (fluconazole 200 mg orally every 12 hours plus itraconazole tablets 200 mg orally every 12 hours) or L-AmB (3 mg/kg intravenously 3 times per week) in this prospective, open-label study. RESULTS: Seventy-two L-AmB-treated patients and 67 F+I-treated patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 47% of patients completed antifungal prophylaxis without a change in therapy for proven or suspected fungal infection. Three patients in each arm developed a proven fungal infection. Twenty-three percent of the L-AmB-treated patients and 24% of the F+I-treated patients were changed to alternative antifungal therapy because of persistent fever (P value not significant). Nine percent of the L-AmB-treated patients developed pneumonia of unknown etiology compared with 16% of the F+I-treated patients (P value not significant). Increases in serum creatinine levels to > 2 mg/dL (20% for the L-AmB arm vs. 6% for the F+I arm; P = 0.012) and increases in serum bilirubin levels to > 2 mg/dL (43% vs. 22%, respectively; P = 0.021) were more common with L-AmB. Infusion-related reactions were noted in five L-AmB-treated patients. Responses to chemotherapy and induction mortality rates were similar for the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: L-AmB and F+I appear similar in their efficacy as antifungal prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy for patients with AML and MDS.

However, the prognostic significance of ras gene mutations in patients with these disorders has been a controversial issue. Although abnormalities in the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene, which is a gene involved in the ras pathway, have been observed frequently in patients with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia, the role of these abnormalities in adult patients with AML or MDS is not clear. METHODS: In this study, bone marrow specimens that were obtained from previously untreated patients with AML and MDS were examined for ras mutations, and the levels of NF1 protein expression were measured. RESULTS: Ras point mutations were detected in 16 of 83 patients with AML (19%) and in 21 of 90 patients with MDS (23%). Fourteen of 28 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (50%) had ras gene mutations. Decreased bone marrow levels of NF1 protein (< 70% of the median level detected in control bone marrow specimens) were observed in 20 of 66 patients with AML (30.3%) and in 8 of 29 patients with MDS (27.6%); none of the patients with ras gene mutations had decreased bone marrow levels of NF1 protein. The presence of a mutant ras gene was associated with a shorter complete remission duration (CRD) in patients with MDS (P = 0.05) but had no effect on survival in patients with AML or MDS. Patients with AML who had decreased NF1 protein levels had a slightly longer CRD compared with patients who had normal NF1 levels (P = 0.07). However, the NF1 level had no significant impact on survival among patients with AML or MDS. When patients with low NF1 levels were grouped with patients who had ras mutations, the patients who had AML had a significantly longer CRD compared with the patients who had MDS (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that a reduction in NF1 protein expression and the presence of ras point mutations may complement each other and that they both play a complex role in the biology of AML and MDS.","['Lu, Di', 'Nounou, Randa', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Lu D', 'Nounou R', 'Beran M', 'Estey E', 'Manshouri T', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Neurofibromin 1)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Neurofibromin 1/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11036 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 15;97(2):441-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11036.,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although FA is well known for the association of aplastic anemia and characteristic birth defects, leukemia and solid tumors also occur at a high rate in this group of patients. A review of all reported cases is informative with regard to the specific types of cancer, the ages at which they occur, and the cumulative probability of their development. METHODS: Medline and bibliographies of publications were searched for articles containing ""Fanconi's anemia"" or ""aplastic anemia"" and all cases of FA from 1927 through 2001 were included in the database. Cancer cases were identified within these reports. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using Stata7 software. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred cases of FA were identified. Nine percent had leukemia (primarily acute myeloid leukemia), 7% had myelodysplastic syndrome, 5% had solid tumors, and 3% had liver tumors. Patients with cancer were older than the cancer-free patients at the time of diagnosis of FA. The median age for cancer (including leukemia) was 16, compared with 68 in the general population. The most frequent solid tumors were aerodigestive and gynecological carcinomas. In approximately 25% of patients with cancer, the malignancy preceded the diagnosis of FA. CONCLUSIONS: If the competing risks of aplastic anemia and leukemia could be removed, the estimated cumulative probability of development of a solid tumor in FA patients is 76% by the age of 45 years. Carcinogenic pathways and cancer prevention, surveillance, and treatment can be studied to advantage in this genetic model of human cancer.","['Alter, Blanche P']",['Alter BP'],"['Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7231, USA. alterb@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Probability', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11046 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 15;97(2):425-40. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11046.,,,221,,['Blood. 2003 Mar 1;101(5):2072.

METHODS: From 1993 to December 1999, the authors analyzed the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of 144 episodes of febrile neutropenia among adult patients with acute leukemia. RESULTS: Forty-three consecutive episodes occurred among patients who were on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during 1993-1996 (ciprofloxacin group), and 101 subsequent episodes occurred among patients who were not exposed to ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (control group). There were no differences in clinical presentation, antibiotic treatment received for the episode, or a worse outcome between groups. The rate of bacteremia was similar (12 of 43 patients [28%] vs. 26 of 101 patients [26%], respectively). There was a trend toward a higher rate of Gram positive bacteremia in the control group (12 of 101 patients [12%] vs. 2 of 43 patients [5%]) and a higher rate of Gram negative bacteremia in the ciprofloxacin group (11 of 43 patients [26%] vs. 15 of 101 patients [15%]). Resistance to fluoroquinolones was greater in Escherichia coli blood isolates from patients in the ciprofloxacin group (7 of 8 patients vs. 2 of 9 patients; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for patients with febrile neutropenia may be abandoned safely in areas with a high prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteria.","['Gomez, Lucia', 'Garau, Javier', 'Estrada, Cristina', 'Marquez, Montserrat', 'Dalmau, David', 'Xercavins, Mariona', 'Marti, Josep Maria', 'Estany, Cristina']","['Gomez L', 'Garau J', 'Estrada C', 'Marquez M', 'Dalmau D', 'Xercavins M', 'Marti JM', 'Estany C']","['Infectious Disease Unit, Service of Internal Medicine, Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. lucigomez@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11044 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 15;97(2):419-24. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11044.,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to report our experience in the treatment of these cases using a uniform approach. PROCEDURE: Patients with overt extraocular retinoblastoma including orbital extension, preauricular lymph node invasion and/or metastatic disease on diagnosis or after extraocular relapse admitted to the Hospital JP Garrahan from August 1987 to December 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated according to two different protocols (1987-1993 and 1994-2000). Treatment included: neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy followed by limited surgery in case of orbital extension (enucleation or resection of residual orbital mass) and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy included cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide, doxorubicin (in protocol 87), idarubicin (in protocol 94), cisplatin (in protocol 87), and carboplatin (in protocol 94). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included. Fifteen of them had orbital or preauricular disease and had a 5-year event-free survival (pEFS) of 84%. Twenty-six had distant metastatic disease and non survived 5-years. One patient died of toxicity and one died in complete remission. One patient had a secondary leukemia. The remaining adverse events included CNS and/or systemic relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment strategy was highly efficacious for patients with orbital and/or lymph node extension. Orbital exenteration is not necessary for these patients. Those patients with distant metastatic or CNS disease were not curable with this approach.","['Chantada, Guillermo', 'Fandino, Adriana', 'Casak, Sandra', 'Manzitti, Julio', 'Raslawski, Elsa', 'Schvartzman, Enrique']","['Chantada G', 'Fandino A', 'Casak S', 'Manzitti J', 'Raslawski E', 'Schvartzman E']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital de Pediatria JP Garrahan, Combate de los Pozos 1881, Buenos Aires, 1245, Argentina. gchantada@garrahan.gov.ar']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures/methods', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Retinoblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10249 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Mar;40(3):158-61. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10249.,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since no recent data on liver histopathology after therapy are available, we conducted a study of the subject. PROCEDURE: Liver biopsy specimens were evaluated and serum liver function tests and lipid profiles measured from 27 consecutive children, aged 3.5-17.6 years, treated according to the regimens for standard (SR) and intermediate risk (IR) ALL. RESULTS: None of the patients had entirely normal liver histology. Fatty infiltration was detected in 25 out of 27 (93%) and siderosis in 19 out of 27 patients (70%). Fourteen (52%) had both. Three (11%) also had mild portal and/or periportal fibrosis in addition to fatty change and siderosis. Fatty change was mainly microvesicular. Siderosis was in most cases grade II/IV to III/IV (in 16/19 or 84%). No hepatitis or cirrhosis was found. Serum total and LDL-cholesterol levels were higher in the patients with fibrosis than in the patients with fatty change (P = 0.036, P = 0.042) or with siderosis +/- fatty change (P = 0.036, P = 0.042). In serial ALT measurements a value of 300 U/L or more was oftener reached in the fibrosis than in the fatty change or siderosis groups (in 33 vs. in 12 or in 4% of the measurements, respectively, P = 0.014, in Kruskall-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: Microvesicular fatty change and siderosis are the main liver findings after current therapy for childhood ALL. Fibrosis occurs rarely. High values in serial serum ALT measurements repeatedly or a disturbed serum lipid profile may facilitate decisions about the need for a liver biopsy.","['Halonen, Paivi', 'Mattila, Jorma', 'Ruuska, Tarja', 'Salo, Matti K', 'Makipernaa, Anne']","['Halonen P', 'Mattila J', 'Ruuska T', 'Salo MK', 'Makipernaa A']","['Paediatric Research Centre, Medical School, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland. paivi.halonen@kotiposti.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatty Liver/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/*drug effects/pathology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/chemically induced/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/pathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Siderosis/*etiology/pathology']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10231 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Mar;40(3):148-54. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10231.,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, hereditary prothrombotic risk factors are associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism in pediatric ALL patients treated according to the BFM 90/95 protocols (including CASP combined with prednisone during induction therapy). To assess whether the thromboembolic risk associated with established prothrombotic risk factors is modified by treatment modalities (prednisone or dexamethasone), the present analysis was performed. Three hundred thirty-six consecutively recruited leukemic children treated according to different BFM protocols (PRED group, n = 280, 60 mg/m(2) prednisone; DEXA group, n = 56, 10 mg/m(2) dexamethasone during induction therapy) were studied. Study end point was the onset of symptomatic vascular accidents during induction therapy. Cumulative thromboembolism-free survival was significantly reduced in children in the PRED group (thrombosis frequency, 10.4%) compared with children in the DEXA group (thrombosis frequency, 1.8%; P =.028). Although no significant difference was found in the overall prevalence of prothrombotic risk factors, 46.5% of patients in the PRED group who experienced thromboembolic events were carriers of a prothrombotic risk factor, whereas no carrier in the DEXA group had a thromboembolism. At the time of maximum CASP activity, fibrinogen and activities of antithrombin, plasminogen, and protein S were significantly reduced in the PRED group. No significant correlation could be found between CASP activity and levels of coagulation factors. In conclusion, the use of dexamethasone instead of prednisone, administered with CASP, significantly reduced the onset of venous thromboembolism.","['Nowak-Gottl, Ulrike', 'Ahlke, Elvira', 'Fleischhack, Gudrun', 'Schwabe, Dirk', 'Schobess, Rosmarie', 'Schumann, Christiane', 'Junker, Ralf']","['Nowak-Gottl U', 'Ahlke E', 'Fleischhack G', 'Schwabe D', 'Schobess R', 'Schumann C', 'Junker R']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Munster, Germany. leagotti@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1901 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51135-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2529-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1901.

To gain insight into the caspase cascade responsible for the execution phase of GC-induced apoptosis, 697 pre-B leukemic cells were stably transfected with dominant negative forms of caspase-8, caspase-9, or caspase-10 and the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA. We observed that inhibition of caspase-9 or caspase-10 activity, but not caspase-8, caused partial resistance of 697 cells to GC-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of multiple caspases through the use of specific peptide inhibitors had an additive effect and caused complete resistance. To identify GR-regulated genes upstream of caspase activation in 697 cells, we performed DNA microarray analysis. 113 genes were identified, which were induced or repressed at least 3-fold by GC. Surprisingly, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a GR-induced gene in other cell types, was repressed 3-fold and correlated with an induction of JNK activity.

This delicate balance is achieved in part by antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as by low-molecular-weight reductants such as glutathione. We evaluated the effect of thiol reagents on the proliferation of the Jurkat human T-cell leukemia-derived cell line. The cells show a multiphasic behavior when grown in the presence of thiols. Low concentrations of N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (0.03 mM) cause growth arrest, and intermediate concentrations (0.3-1.0 mM) induce apoptosis. Similarly, 1 mM N-acetylcysteine or glutathione induce apoptosis in more than 40% of the cells. Surprisingly, the cells grow well in higher concentrations (3-10 mM) of these reagents. Because the I58T variant of human SOD2 is thiol-sensitive, we measured SOD in Jurkat cells grown in the presence of thiol agents, observing markedly less SOD activity. In cell-free extracts, thiols quickly eliminated the SOD2 activity. Jurkat cells contain little SOD2 activity, with a different electrophoretic mobility from that of normal lymphocytes. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the Jurkat sod2 gene revealed a pattern different from the wild-type gene, suggesting a mutation in the sod2 gene. This was confirmed by cloning and sequencing the gene. Jurkat cells are heterozygous for a new mutation, L60F, in exon 3 of the mature protein.

It has been hypothesized that immunological approaches to cytolysis may be used to overcome drug resistance. RV+ is a P-gp-expressing variant of the human myeloid leukemic cell line HL60 that displays a typical MDR phenotype. MDR RV+ cells displayed relative resistance to the immunotoxin (IT) HuM195-gelonin and to free rGelonin. K562 leukemia cells retrovirally infected to overexpress P-gp are also resistant to HuM195-gelonin. In addition, a monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting the function of P-gp was able to partially reverse resistance to the IT. These data indicated that the expression of P-gp may contribute to IT resistance in RV+. Resistance to the IT was not mediated through decreased binding to cells, nor reduced internalization into the cell because the IT displayed similar kinetics of binding and internalization for both the parental HL60 and MDR RV+ cell lines. Comparison of the cytotoxicity of other ribosome-inactivating toxins indicated that RV+ cells were not universally resistant to toxins: RV+ cells were sensitive to the actions of ricin A chain, which acts on precisely the same RNase target as gelonin. Sensitivity of the MDR RV+ cells to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, saponin, and Pseudomonas exotoxin A additionally confirmed that the resistance was not mediated through the ribosome and that pathways downstream from the inactivation of protein synthesis leading to cell death were not substantially perturbed in the MDR cells. Resistance could be partially abrogated by bafilomycin A, which inhibits lysosomal function. Moreover, direct visualization by confocal microscopy of the intracellular trafficking route of the IT showed that the IT accumulated preferentially in the lysosome in MDR RV+ cells but not in sensitive cells. These observations implicated the process of increased lysosomal degradation as the most likely basis for resistance. Such pathways of resistance may be important in the therapeutic applications of ITs, now becoming available for human use.","['McGrath, Melissa S', 'Rosenblum, Michael G', 'Philips, Mark R', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['McGrath MS', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Philips MR', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Immunology, Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Plant Proteins/toxicity', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/03/28 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Jan 1;63(1):72-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 65 children under 15 years old were studied, including 25 children with ALL undergoing chemotherapy, 30 with asthma in remission who were regularly followed at clinics, and 10 healthy children. The influenza vaccine contained antigens B/Yamanashi/166/98, A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2). RESULTS: Children with ALL developed significant antibody titers to A/Panama /2007/ 99 antigen 4 weeks after the second immunization. Seroconversion rates after two doses of vaccine were 57.1 to 84.6% and seroresponse rates were between 24 and 60% in children with ALL. Compared to children with asthma in remission, who were regarded as immunocompetent individuals, the ALL children had less seroconversion and lower seroresponse rates to A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1). The seroconversion and seroresponse rates to B/Yamanashi/166/98 and A/ Panama/2007/99(H3N2) antigens were comparable in asthmatic and leukemic children. On the other hand, the antibody response in children with ALL who received reinduction chemotherapy suggests that the therapy did not impair seroresponse rates.

In this study, we elucidated the effect of 2-[4-(7-chloro-2-quinoxalinyloxyphenoxy]-propionic acid (XK469; a new Topo IIbeta inhibitor) in the modulation of Topo IIalpha levels and sensitivity to Topo IIalpha poisons. We demonstrate by Western blot analysis that indolent B-cell tumors express undetectable levels of this enzyme and are refractory to the effects of Topo IIalpha poisons such as VP16. Using the Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) cell line WSU-WM, we show that XK469 induced the expression of Topo IIalpha protein by 24 h compared with control. Immunofluorescence studies by confocal microscopy using a specific monoclonal antibody against Topo IIalpha supported the immunoblot findings with high intensity staining in XK469-exposed cells. To determine the effect of up-regulating Topo IIalpha on sensitivity of Topo IIalpha-directed inhibitors, WSU-WM cells were exposed to simultaneous, sequential, and reverse order XK469 and VP16. We demonstrate that 24 h of exposure to XK469 before VP16 resulted in a maximum synergistic response. In contrast, simultaneous or reverse order exposure resulted in an antagonistic effect. A similar trend was observed with cells obtained from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but not in normal lymphocytes. This increase in VP16 sensitivity after 24 h of XK469 exposure was associated with VP16-dependent DNA cleavage, as demonstrated by formation of a smeared DNA band in a SDS-KCL DNA cleavage assay. From this study, we concluded that XK469 up-regulates Topo IIalpha levels and consequently sensitizes indolent malignant B cells to the cytotoxic effect of VP16 in a schedule-dependent manner.","['Mensah-Osman, Edith J', 'Al-Katib, Ayad M', 'Wu, Hai-Young', 'Osman, Nadir I', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M']","['Mensah-Osman EJ', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Wu HY', 'Osman NI', 'Mohammad RM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA079837-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA22453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES0639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (XK 469)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Blotting, Western', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy/metabolism']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 Dec;1(14):1321-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The MNCs were collected from bone marrow of 14 CML-CP patients by centrifugalization in lymphocyte-separation medium, and cultivated in the medium with IFN-alpha and IFN-alpha plus GM-CSF for 24 hours. The expression levels of bcr-abl, bcl-2, c-myc and beta-actin were detected by using relatively quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and optical density scanning technology for the amplified fragments. The statistical differences between each inducing experimental group and the control were analyzed by t-test in pairs. RESULTS: Both IFN-alpha (200 U.ml-1) and IFN-alpha combined with GM-CSF (10 ng.ml-1) significantly inhibited bcr-abl gene expression, meanwhile IFN-alpha partially suppressed c-myc and bcl-2 gene expression, and GM-CSF significantly inhibited bcl-2 gene expression but partially upregulated bcr-abl and c-myc gene expression levels on the basis of IFN-alpha effects. CONCLUSIONS: Both IFN-alpha and IFN-alpha plus GM-CSF can inhibit the expression of anti-apoptosis gene such as bcr-abl and bcl-2, and regulate the expression of c-myc. It is the possible mechanism of IFN-alpha therapy or combined therapy on CML at chronic phase that the malignant clone expansion is inhibited by promoting apoptotic cell death.","['Tang, L J', 'Chen, H C', 'Peng, X H']","['Tang LJ', 'Chen HC', 'Peng XH']","['Research Center for Molecular Biology, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410078.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Hunan yi ke da xue xue bao = Hunan yike daxue xuebao = Bulletin of Hunan Medical University,9424769,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/09 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/01/09 04:00'],"['2003/01/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2000 Dec 28;25(6):570-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we identified p115RhoGEF, one of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho, as a direct link between Galpha13 and Rho [Kozasa, T., et al. (1998) Science 280, 2109-2111; Hart, M. J., et al. (1998) Science 280, 2112-2114]. Activated Galpha13 stimulated the RhoGEF activity of p115 through interaction with the N-terminal RGS domain. However, Galpha12 could not activate Rho through p115, although it interacted with the RGS domain of p115. The biochemical mechanism from Galpha12 to Rho activation remained unknown. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), which also contains RGS domain, with Galpha12 and Galpha13. RGS domain of LARG demonstrated Galpha12- and Galpha13-specific GAP activity. LARG synergistically stimulated SRF activation by Galpha12 and Galpha13 in HeLa cells, and the SRF activation by Galpha12-LARG was further stimulated by coexpression of Tec tyrosine kinase. It was also found that LARG is phosphorylated on tyrosine by Tec. In reconstitution assays, the RhoGEF activity of nonphosphorylated LARG was stimulated by Galpha13 but not Galpha12. However, when LARG was phosphorylated by Tec, Galpha12 effectively stimulated the RhoGEF activity of LARG. These results demonstrate the biochemical mechanism of Rho activation through Galpha12 and that the regulation of RhoGEFs by heterotrimeric G proteins G1213 is further modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.","['Suzuki, Nobuchika', 'Nakamura, Susumu', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Kozasa, Tohru']","['Suzuki N', 'Nakamura S', 'Mano H', 'Kozasa T']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Tec protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC141065,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0234057100 [doi]', '0234057100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jan 21;100(2):733-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0234057100.

Introduction of the Mll-AF9 fusion gene into embryonic stem cells results in leukemia in mice with cell-type specificity similar to humans. In this study we used myeloid colony assays, immunophenotyping, and transplantation to evaluate myelopoiesis in Mll-AF9 mice. Colony assays demonstrated that both prenatal and postnatal Mll-AF9 tissues have significantly increased numbers of CD11b(+)/CD117(+)/Gr-1(+/-) myeloid cells, often in compact clusters. The self-renewal capacity of prenatal myeloid progenitors was found to decrease following serial replating of colony-forming cells. In contrast, early postnatal myeloid progenitors increased following replating; however, the enhanced self-renewal of early postnatal myeloid progenitor cells was limited and did not result in long-term cell lines or leukemia in vivo. Unlimited replating, long-term CD11b/Gr-1(+) myeloid cell lines, and the ability to produce early leukemia in vivo in transplantation experiments, were found only in mice with overt leukemia. Prenatal Mll-AF9 tissues had reduced total (mature and progenitor) CD11b/Gr-1(+) cells compared with wild-type tissues. Colony replating, immunophenotyping, and cytochemistry suggest that any perturbation of cellular differentiation from the prenatal stage onward is partial and largely reversible. We describe a novel informative in vitro and in vivo model system that permits study of the stages in the pathogenesis of Mll fusion gene leukemia, beginning in prenatal myeloid cells, progressing to a second stage in the postnatal period and, finally, resulting in overt leukemia in adult animals.","['Johnson, Jennifer J', 'Chen, Weili', 'Hudson, Wendy', 'Yao, Qing', 'Taylor, Marnie', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Kersey, John H']","['Johnson JJ', 'Chen W', 'Hudson W', 'Yao Q', 'Taylor M', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Kersey JH']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/embryology/growth & development', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting', 'Gestational Age', 'Hematopoietic System/embryology/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Liver/embryology/growth & development', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1515 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50825-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3229-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1515.

Expression of this protein in transgenic mice initiates myeloid leukemias with features of human APL, but only after a long latency (8.5 months in MRP8 PML-RARA mice). Thus, additional changes contribute to leukemic transformation. Activating mutations of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase are common in human acute myeloid leukemias and are frequent in human APL. To assess how activating mutations of FLT3 contribute to APL pathogenesis and impact therapy, we used retroviral transduction to introduce an activated allele of FLT3 into control and MRP8 PML-RARA transgenic bone marrow. Activated FLT3 cooperated with PML-RAR alpha to induce leukemias in 62 to 299 days (median latency, 105 days). In contrast to the leukemias that arose spontaneously in MRP8 PML-RARA mice, the activated FLT3/PML-RAR alpha leukemias were characterized by leukocytosis, similar to human APL with FLT3 mutations. Cytogenetic analysis revealed clonal karyotypic abnormalities, which may contribute to pathogenesis or progression. SU11657, a selective, oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets FLT3, cooperated with all-trans retinoic acid to rapidly cause regression of leukemia. Our results suggest that the acquisition of FLT3 mutations by cells with a pre-existing t(15;17) is a frequent pathway to the development of APL. Our findings also indicate that APL patients with FLT3 mutations may benefit from combination therapy with all-trans retinoic acid plus an FLT3 inhibitor.","['Sohal, Jastinder', 'Phan, Vernon T', 'Chan, Philip V', 'Davis, Elizabeth M', 'Patel, Bhumi', 'Kelly, Louise M', 'Abrams, Tinya J', ""O'Farrell, Anne Marie"", 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Sohal J', 'Phan VT', 'Chan PV', 'Davis EM', 'Patel B', 'Kelly LM', 'Abrams TJ', ""O'Farrell AM"", 'Gilliland DG', 'Le Beau MM', 'Kogan SC']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA75986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Implants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SU 11657)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Drug Implants', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Organic Chemicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1800 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50820-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3188-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1800.

To better understand the role of SERCA proteins and cellular calcium homeostasis in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation, we investigated the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of SERCA-dependent calcium uptake into the ER on ATRA-induced differentiation of the HL-60 myelogenous and the NB4 promyelocytic cell lines. SERCA inhibitors di-tert-butyl-benzohydroquinone (tBHQ), thapsigargin, and cyclopiazonic acid significantly enhanced the induction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity and CD11b marker expression induced by suboptimal concentrations of ATRA (50 nM) in both cell lines. Analysis of cellular calcium homeostasis revealed that a 60% mobilization of the total SERCA-dependent intracellular calcium pool was necessary to obtain enhancement of ATRA-dependent differentiation by tBHQ. Moreover, after 3 days of ATRA treatment in combination with tBHQ, NB4 cells showed a significantly decreased calcium mobilization compared with treatments with tBHQ or ATRA alone, suggesting that enhanced differentiation and calcium mobilization are causally related. Interestingly, several ATRA-resistant NB4-derived cell lines were partially responsive to the differentiation-inducing effect of the combination of the 2 drugs. In addition, we found that retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and PML-RAR alpha proteins are protected from ATRA-induced proteolytic degradation by SERCA inhibition, indicating that cellular calcium homeostasis may interact with signaling systems involved in the control of ATRA-dependent transcriptional activity. By linking calcium to ATRA-dependent signaling, our data open new avenues in the understanding of the mechanisms of differentiation-induction therapy of leukemia.","['Launay, Sophie', 'Gianni, Maurizio', 'Diomede, Luisa', 'Machesky, Laura M', 'Enouf, Jocelyne', 'Papp, Bela']","['Launay S', 'Gianni M', 'Diomede L', 'Machesky LM', 'Enouf J', 'Papp B']","['U348 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, IFR Circulation Lariboisiere, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France. sophie.launay@u-bourgogne.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'C12674942B (2-tert-butylhydroquinone)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X9TLY4580Z (cyclopiazonic acid)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'NADPH Oxidases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Thapsigargin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2730 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50824-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3220-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2730.

METHODS: Multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) was used to correlate the expression of cyclin B1 with the position in cell cycle of immortal cells in vivo and in vitro using the MOLT-4 cell line as control. Cells which belonged to G(1)-phase were sorted by FCM according DNA diploidy, and then the expression of cyclin B1 was examined by confocal microscope to confirm the results. For further analysis, different subgroups in G(1) phase were sorted according to the fluorescent intensity of cyclin E, and then the exact period in G(1) phase when cyclin B1 was expressed, were assayed by Western blot. RESULTS: Unscheduled expression of cyclin B1 expressed in G(1)-phase was found not only in synchronized leukemia cells MOLT-4 and in vivo transformed T-7 cells, but also in vivo tumor cells detached from clinical samples. In the synchronized growing cells, cyclin B1 was mainly detected in the early G(1) phase, while in transformed T7 cells, cyclin B1 was mainly detected in the late G(1) phase. CONCLUSION: The limitation of detecting cyclin B1 is due to its unscheduled expression, rending cyclin B1 being detected at different time-spots in the G(1) phase. This phenomenon may be related to the adjustment between the loss of control in cell proliferation and cell apoptosis, thereby leading to tumorigenesis.","['Shen, Manli', 'Feng, Yongdong', 'Gao, Chun', 'Tao, Deding', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Shen M', 'Feng Y', 'Gao C', 'Tao D', 'Gong J']","['Molecular Medical Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Central China University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclin B/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclin B1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/01/30 04:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2002 May;24(3):215-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiations of these leukemia cells were observed cytomorphologically and examined by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test. The cell DNA cycle and membrane cluster differentiation (CD) antigens (CD33, CD11b) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that 82.5% +/- 4.8% of APL cells were induced into morphologically and functionally differentiated cells. The cell growth curve showed that the growth of APL cells was inhibited. The degree of differentiation and growth inhibition induced by Tan II A was not different from that by ATRA (P > 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis showed that Tan II A arrested APL cells in G0/G1 phase and inhibited cellular DNA synthesis. This study demonstrates that Tan II A can induce differentiation of APL cells in vitro, and hence it is worthy of further studies for clinical use.","['Liang, Y', 'Yang, Y', 'Yuan, S', 'Liu, T', 'Jia, Y', 'Xu, C', 'Niu, T', 'Qin, H', 'Qin, P']","['Liang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Yuan S', 'Liu T', 'Jia Y', 'Xu C', 'Niu T', 'Qin H', 'Qin P']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, WCUMS, Chengdu 610041.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Hua Xi Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Hua xi yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of West China University of Medical Sciences = Huaxi yike daxue xuebao,8609552,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/08 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/01/08 04:00'],"['2003/01/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hua Xi Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2000 Jun;31(2):207-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parallel monitoring of the expression profiles of thousands of genes seems particularly promising for a deeper understanding of cancer biology and the identification of molecular signatures supporting the histological classification schemes of neoplastic specimens. However, the increasing volume of data generated by microarray experiments poses the challenge of developing equally efficient methods and analysis procedures to extract, interpret, and upgrade the information content of these databases. Herein, a computational procedure for pattern identification, feature extraction, and classification of gene expression data through the analysis of an autoassociative neural network model is described. The identified patterns and features contain critical information about gene-phenotype relationships observed during changes in cell physiology. They represent a rational and dimensionally reduced base for understanding the basic biology of the onset of diseases, defining targets of therapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for the identification and classification of pathological states. The proposed method has been tested on two different microarray datasets-Golub's analysis of acute human leukemia [Golub et al. (1999) Science 286:531-537], and the human colon adenocarcinoma study presented by Alon et al. [1999; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:10101-10106]. The analysis of the neural network internal structure allows the identification of specific phenotype markers and the extraction of peculiar associations among genes and physiological states. At the same time, the neural network outputs provide assignment to multiple classes, such as different pathological conditions or tissue samples, for previously unseen instances.","['Bicciato, Silvio', 'Pandin, Mario', 'Didone, Giuseppe', 'Di Bello, Carlo']","['Bicciato S', 'Pandin M', 'Didone G', 'Di Bello C']","['Department of Chemical Process Engineering, University of Padova, via Marzolo, 9, 35131, Padova, Italy. silvio.bicciato@unipd.it']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/classification/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'DNA/classification/genetics', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Phenotype']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.10505 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2003 Mar 5;81(5):594-606. doi: 10.1002/bit.10505.,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several proteins have been identified that pump chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells, thus bringing about MDR. One representative pump is the P-glycoprotein, whose function can be inhibited by blockers (also known as reversers, modulators or chemosensitizers). In clinical application, many of these blockers are often not effective because they become bound to the plasma of the patients. The extent of plasma binding of the blocker varies in different persons and we have developed a 96-well kit to assay such inter-person differences. The assay uses membrane vesicles isolated from a human lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM Col1000). Uptake of rhodamine into the vesicles was measured with different concentrations of the blockers verapamil and XR9576 in presence of human plasma. The reverser XR9576 is nearly 30 times more effective than the classical blocker verapamil, the relevant K(m) values ranging from 2.66 to 45 nM for XR 9576 and 0.7 to 5.5 microM for verapamil.

The results showed that both cell lines expressed LTAg when the inducer was present in the culture media. When ponasterone A was removed, the majority of the cells died. After 60 generations, however, the continued expression of LTAg in the absence of the hormone indicated that unknown changes may have occurred in the genome of the cells.

Many general hospitals use it for routine tests. One of the main usage is immunophenotyping for hematological malignancies. Flowcytometric immunophenotyping (FCM-IM) facilitates accurate diagnosis in both leukemias and lymphoid proliferative disorders (LPDs). It becomes an indispensable criteria in the diagnosis of hematological malignancies. It may also offer additional therapeutically relevant information. Typical patterns of immunophenotype in leukemias and certain types of LPDs are illustrated in figure 1 and figure 2. But variation or overlapping appears often. In order to reach a definitive diagnosis and to have a common interpretation between laboratory to laboratory the following items need not to be ignored: 1. Direct staining and multi-color or multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis is necessary. 2. The phenotype of abnormal cells should be determined on as pure a population as possible therefore CD45/SSC gating is critical for isolating the blast population (abnormal cells). CD45/SSC gating is much better than FSC/SSC gating especially when percentage of blast is low in the sample. Else, each subtype of leukemia has its special CD45/SSC pattern. 3. The phenotype of this certain population should be described clearly but it is not necessary to count the percentage of each marker. 4. > 20% for positive threshold used in indirect staining method may be confused in multi-color direct staining method. 5. Hybrid leukemia diagnosed by FCM only should be in caution since the divergence of antigen/antibody, the lineage infidelity of antigen expression and the biological characteristics of the leukemic cells.

However, there is a deficiency of DC function in the majority of leukemia patients. It is a novel idea that expanding DC in vitro and enhancing their antitumor immune function and DC-based tumor vaccines may be used as an efficient immune therapy for leukemia. In the project, the condition to induce DC from myeloid leukemia cell lines and its anti-leukemia response were investigated. HL-60, K562 and THP-1 cells were cultured with various combinations of cytokines for inducing DC. The morphologic features were analyzed with optical and electron microscopy. The phenotype of DC was detected by FCM with CD1a, CD40, CD80, CD86, HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies. The ability of DC stimulating lymphocyte proliferation was observed by allo-mixed lymphocyte reaction using (3)H-TdR incorporation. Cytotoxicity assay was measured by (51)Cr-release method. The level of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in supernatant of DC culture was measured by ELISA. It was proved that the DCs derived from K562, HL-60 and THP-1 cells showed a typical morphology of dendritic cell. The induced cells expressed the surface differentiation antigens of DC. A high expression of phenotypes was found in HL-60-DC and THP-1-DC stimulated by GM-CSF + IL-4 + TNF-gamma and K562-DC with GM-CSF + IL-4 + IL-12. The DCs from the 3 leukemia cell lines stimulated allo-MLR and CTL reaction strongly. Different contents of IL-12 were detected in the supernatants of DC culture and IFN-gamma in the coculture of DC and blood mononuclear cells. It is concluded that the myeloid leukemia cells are able to be induced DCs by cytokines in vitro. The different leukemia cells need different cytokines and cultural conditions. DCs derived from leukemia cells express phenotype of antigen-presenting cells. They have the ability of stimulating T lymphocyte proliferation and inducing CTL reaction to clear leukemia cells, and the DCs secrete IL-12 and increase secretion of IFN-gamma by T cells.","['Luo, Yun-Ping', 'Li, Yong-Guo', 'Cai, Da-Chuan', 'Ren, Hong']","['Luo YP', 'Li YG', 'Cai DC', 'Ren H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing 400016, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD1/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Jun;10(3):229-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of acute GVHD grade II - IV in G-CSF primed donor group was surprisingly as low,as only two cases of thirty-two transplants (6.3%) with acute GVHD grade II limited to the skin. Whereas, five of eighteen patients (27.8%) in the control group developed acute GVHD grade II - IV (P = 0.032). G-CSF primed donors showed reduced CD4(+) and increased CD8(+) cells, resulting in a significant reduction of CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio as compared with non-primed marrow. The total CD3(+) cell count kept unchanged in G-CSF primed donors. There were not significant differences in the incidence of the chronic GVHD (24% vs 33.3%), relapse rate (12.5% vs 11.1%) and overall survival rate (78.1% vs 66.7%, P = 0.32) during 6 - 50 months of follow-up. In conclusion, G-CSF primed donor marrow accelerates engraftment. Although G-CSF did not change the total CD3(+) cells in bone marrow, it altered the ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells and significantly reduced the incidence of acute GVHD.","['Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Ji, Shu-Quan', 'Wang, Hang-Xiang', 'Yan, Hong-Ming']","['Chen HR', 'Ji SQ', 'Wang HX', 'Yan HM']","['Research Center for Hematology, The General Hospital of Air Force, Beijing 100036, China. chenhuiren@263.net']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/07/24 05:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Aug;10(4):340-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRAIL induces apoptosis by activating caspase cascades, stimulating a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psim) and cytochrome C release in the FADD/caspase-8 dependent pathway. However, TRAIL can also trigger transcriptional activations of the pro-oncogene of c-fos, JNK, and NF-kappaB by other signaling pathways downstream of FADD/caspase-8. MAPK/ERK activation has a dominant protecting effect over apoptotic signaling from the death receptors. The functional expression of TRAIL by leukemic cells may be involved in tumor cells evasion of immunosurveillance. Somatic mutations of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of some tumors. TRAIL can induce apoptosis on various continuous transformed cell lines and primary tumor cells, including several of hematopoietic origin, displaying minimal toxic effects on normal tissues. Because of the abilities of induction of both cytotoxic (apoptosis) and cytostatic (cell cycle perturbation) effects on the leukemic cells, TRAIL is currently considered as a potential(co) therapeutic drug against tumors.","['Qian, Jun', 'Chen, Zi-Xing']","['Qian J', 'Chen ZX']","['Leukemia Research Unit, The First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Oct;10(5):472-7.,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were monitored up to day 100 for the sign of aGVHD. The established grades II to IV aGVHD occurred in 5 out of 17 patients (29.4%). Eleven patients were surviving at a median follow-up of 13 months (range 3 - 27 months). Six out of the 17 patients died those 3 of them died of severe aGVHD, 2 of infection and 1 of leukemia relapse. Severe regimen-related toxicities were not experienced in all patients. The median follow-up period was 13 (range 3 - 27) months. Eleven patients were alive in disease-free situation with a Karnofsky performance status of 100%. This could be caused by the low overall incidence of aGVHD as a result of BM primed with G-CSF. The four-agent of immunosuppressive combined prophylaxis against GVHD in different periods may be highly effective.","['Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Ji, Shu-Quan', 'Yan, Hong-Min', 'Wang, Heng-Xiang']","['Chen HR', 'Ji SQ', 'Yan HM', 'Wang HX']","['Research Centre for Hematology, The General Hospital of Air Force, Beijing 100036, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Dec;10(6):548-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I (CRAC) refills calcium stores and permits sustained calcium signalling. The relationship between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R)-containing stores and I (CRAC) is not understood. A model of global InsP(3)R store depletion coupling with I (CRAC) activation may be simplistic, since intracellular stores are heterogeneous in their release and refilling activities. Here we use a ligand-gated calcium channel, TRPV1 (transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1), as a new tool to probe store heterogeneity and define intracellular calcium compartments in a mast cell line. TRPV1 has activity as an intracellular release channel but does not mediate global calcium store depletion and does not invade a store coupled with I (CRAC). Intracellular TRPV1 localizes to a subset of the InsP(3)R-containing stores. TRPV1 sensitivity functionally subdivides the InsP(3)-sensitive store, as does heterogeneity in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase isoforms responsible for store refilling. These results provide unequivocal evidence that a specific 'CRAC store' exists within the InsP(3)-releasable calcium stores and describe a novel methodology for manipulation of intracellular free calcium.","['Turner, Helen', 'Fleig, Andrea', 'Stokes, Alexander', 'Kinet, Jean-Pierre', 'Penner, Reinhold']","['Turner H', 'Fleig A', 'Stokes A', 'Kinet JP', 'Penner R']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, John A.

To investigate whether leptin plays a role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we investigated the levels of leptin in plasma with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the expression of the leptin receptor on malignant lymphoblasts with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At diagnosis, the leptin levels of bone marrow-derived plasma in children with ALL were found to be significantly lower than the levels of healthy control subjects (0.92 +/- 0.79 ng/mL versus 3.01 +/- 2.27 ng/mL, respectively). Notably, at complete hematologic remission (at day 33 of chemotherapy), leptin levels had normalized to 2.6 +/- 2.4 ng/mL. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, we analyzed the expression of the leptin receptor on the mononuclear cell populations of the patients. RT-PCR analysis revealed gene expression rates of 33% at diagnosis versus 71% at remission, compared with 100% for healthy control subjects. Results of immunohistochemical staining supported these findings by showing that the tumor clones themselves do not express the leptin receptor.

The present study aimed at discovering the prevalence of use of CAM cancer therapies in leukaemia patients visiting haematology clinic of a north Indian tertiary care hospital. METHODS: 533 consecutive leukaemia patients were interviewed. Information was gathered about patients' demographics, types of CAM taken, sequence of seeking CAM and conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons of opting for CAM, and areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM. Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: Prevalence of CAM use in leukaemia patients was found to be 56.6%. Ayurveda was the most commonly used CAM (33%). Most of the patients sought conventional medicine first, followed by CAM therapies. Fifty-two percent of the patients opted for CAM hoping for a miracle cure and 51% were dissatisfied with these therapies. Family members and neighbours constituted major source of recommendation of CAM therapy. Only 3.8% of the patients had informed their doctors about CAM use. CONCLUSION: A sizeable percentage of patients receiving conventional treatment for leukaemia also use CAM therapies. Clinicians should not underestimate the value of hopeful attitude in their management of leukaemia patients and ought to be conversant with popular forms of CAM cancer therapies.","['Gupta, M', 'Shafiq, N', 'Kumari, S', 'Pandhi, P']","['Gupta M', 'Shafiq N', 'Kumari S', 'Pandhi P']","['Department of Pharmacology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh-160 012, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Complementary Therapies/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', 'Perception/*physiology']",,2003/01/07 04:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/01/07 04:00'],"['2003/01/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pds.782 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2002 Dec;11(8):671-6. doi: 10.1002/pds.782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small ligand molecules able to bind tightly to DNA in a well-defined configuration are being actively searched for. With this goal in mind, we have designed and synthesized the trifunctional molecule R-132, which combines a bispyrrole skeleton for minor groove DNA recognition and two different chromophores, anilinoacridine and ethidium. The affinity and mode of binding of R-132 to DNA were studied by a combination of complementary biochemical and biophysical techniques, which included absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and circular and linear dichroism. A surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis was also performed to quantify the kinetic parameters of the drug-DNA interaction process. Altogether, the results demonstrate that the three moieties of the hybrid molecule are engaged in the interaction process, thus validating the rational design strategy. At the biological level, R-132 stabilizes topoisomerase-II-DNA covalent complexes and displays potent cytotoxic activities, which are attributable to its DNA-binding properties. R-132 easily enters and accumulates in cell nuclei, as evidenced by confocal microscopy. R-132 therefore provides a novel lead compound for the design of gene-targeted anticancer agents.","['Carrasco, Carolina', 'Helissey, Philippe', 'Haroun, Michelyne', 'Baldeyrou, Brigitte', 'Lansiaux, Amelie', 'Colson, Pierre', 'Houssier, Claude', 'Giorgi-Renault, Sylviane', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Carrasco C', 'Helissey P', 'Haroun M', 'Baldeyrou B', 'Lansiaux A', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Giorgi-Renault S', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524 et Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",IM,"['Acridines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/chemistry', 'Drug Design', 'Ethidium/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Netropsin/analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbic.200390014 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2003 Jan 3;4(1):50-61. doi: 10.1002/cbic.200390014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laser scanning confocal imaging of transfected cells expressing fluorescently labeled SRC-1 revealed that in an unsynchronized cell population, the coactivator is distributed in approximately 40% cells as nuclear bodies of 0.2-1.0 microm in diameter. Immunostaining of cyan fluorescent protein-labeled SRC-1 (CFP-SRC1)-expressing cells with antibody to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein showed significant overlap of the CFP fluorescence with the antibody stain. Cotransfection of cells with a plasmid expressing the CFP conjugate of Sp100 (another marker protein for the PML nuclear body) also showed colocalization of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-SRC1 containing nuclear foci with the PML bodies in living cells. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure revealed that the PML bodies are round to elliptical in shape with multiple satellite bodies on their surface. Some of these satellite bodies contain the SRC-1. Activation and nuclear import of CFP-AR by the agonistic ligand 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, but not by the antagonist casodex, transferred YFP-SRC1 from the PML bodies to an interlacing filamentous structure. In a single living cell, agonist-activated AR caused a time-dependent movement of YFP-SRC1 from the PML bodies to this filamentous structure. Additionally, coexpression of a constitutively active mutant of AR (AR-deltaligand binding domain) also displaced YFP-SRC1 from the PML bodies to this intranuclear filamentous structure. The fluorescence recovery after photobleaching approach was used to examine changes in the kinetics of movement of YFP-SRC1 during its mobilization from the PML bodies to the intranuclear filamentous structure by the agonist-activated AR. Results of the relative half-times (t(1/2)) of replacement of YFP-SRC1 within the photobleached region of a single PML body from its surrounding nuclear space supported the conclusion that SRC-1 is actively transported from the PML bodies to the intranuclear filamentous structure by the ligand-activated AR. This observation also suggests an interaction between AR and SRC-1 before its binding to the target gene. The PML bodies have been implicated as a cross-road for multiple regulatory pathways that control cell proliferation, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Our present results along with other recent reports expand the role of this subnuclear structure to include the regulation of steroid hormone action.","['Rivera, Omar J', 'Song, Chung S', 'Centonze, Victoria E', 'Lechleiter, James D', 'Chatterjee, Bandana', 'Roy, Arun K']","['Rivera OJ', 'Song CS', 'Centonze VE', 'Lechleiter JD', 'Chatterjee B', 'Roy AK']","['Department of Cellular & Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78245-3207, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-DK-14744/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37AG-10486/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AG-00165/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (NCOA1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Receptors, Androgen/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/me.2002-0165 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2003 Jan;17(1):128-40. doi: 10.1210/me.2002-0165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When 5 microm N-acetylsphingosine (C(2)-ceramide) or 20 microm H(2)O(2) alone induced little increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as judged by the 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate method, 20 microm H(2)O(2) enhanced oxidative damage as judged by ROS accumulation, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance production after pretreatment with 5 microm C(2)-ceramide at least for 12 h. The treatment with a catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1h-1,2,4-triazole, increased oxidative damage and apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2), and in contrast, purified catalase inhibited the enhancement of oxidative damage by H(2)O(2) in ceramide-pretreated cells, suggesting that the oxidative effect of ceramide is involved in catalase regulation. Indeed, C(2)-ceramide inhibited the activity of immunoprecipitated catalase and decreased the levels of catalase protein in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde, which dominantly inhibited caspase-3 and blocked the increase of oxidative damage and apoptosis due to C(2)-ceramide-induced catalase depletion at protein and activity levels. In vitro, active and purified caspase-3, but not caspase-6, -8, and -9, inhibited catalase activity and induced the proteolysis of catalase protein whereas these in vitro effects of caspase-3 were blocked by acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde. Taken together, it is suggested that H(2)O(2) enhances apoptosis in ceramide-pretreated cells, because ceramide increases oxidative damage by inhibition of ROS scavenging ability through caspase-3-dependent proteolysis of catalase.","['Iwai, Kazuya', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Watanabe, Mitsumasa', 'Yabu, Takeshi', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Taguchi, Yoshimitu', 'Umehara, Hisanori', 'Takahashi, Atsushi', 'Uchiyama, Takashi', 'Okazaki, Toshiro']","['Iwai K', 'Kondo T', 'Watanabe M', 'Yabu T', 'Kitano T', 'Taguchi Y', 'Umehara H', 'Takahashi A', 'Uchiyama T', 'Okazaki T']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M201867200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71373-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 14;278(11):9813-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M201867200.

To study this altered function, NK92 cells were transduced with the BCR/ABL oncogene. In contrast to the parental cells, which died when deprived of interleukin 2 (IL-2), p210(+) NK92 cells proliferated and survived indefinitely in the absence of IL-2. BCR/ABL also decreased the natural cytotoxicity of NK92 cells against K562 targets, without affecting IL-2, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production. Although the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI-571) had no effect on parental NK92 cells, it markedly decreased the growth and survival of IL-2-independent p210(+) NK92 cells. In contrast to the parental cell line, serial analysis of p210(+) NK92 cells detected small populations that clonally expressed one or more killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Unlike the decreased natural cytotoxicity, the function of the activating CD158j receptor remained intact. Southern blotting and hybridization with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) probe showed that KIR(-) and KIR(+) NK92 cells were all derived from the same clone, suggesting that KIR acquisition remains dynamic at the maturational stage represented by the NK92 cell line. When tested in primary CD56(+bright) NK cells, p210 induced partial IL-2-independent growth and increased KIR expression similar to findings in NK92 cells. This is the first study to show that BCR/ABL, well known for its effects on the myeloid lineage, can alter the function of lymphoid cells, which may be associated with the defect in innate immunity associated with CML progression.","['Chiorean, Elena G', 'Dylla, Scott J', 'Olsen, Krista', 'Lenvik, Todd', 'Soignier, Yvette', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Chiorean EG', 'Dylla SJ', 'Olsen K', 'Lenvik T', 'Soignier Y', 'Miller JS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['M01-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-55417/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1172 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50734-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3527-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1172.

Here we report for the first time the expression of AID in healthy human B-lymphocytes and in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). AID mRNA expression in humans is restricted to the CD19(+)CD38(+)IgD(-) germinal center cells, namely the CD19(+)CD38(+)CD44(-) centroblasts. After in vitro stimulation of naive human B cells by CD40-L and IL-4, AID mRNA is strongly induced for only 48 hours. In a survey of human B-NHL AID was found to be constitutively expressed in follicular lymphoma and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma but to be absent in B-precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, in mantle cell lymphoma, and in plasma cell myeloma. In B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia, in immunocytoma, and in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT, AID mRNA was expressed only in some samples. In follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the expression of AID mRNA was coincident with the presence of SHM in the variable region exons of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene. In human B-NHL, the AID mRNA is spliced into 4 different variants but does not contain point mutations. Thus AID, which is highly regulated during healthy B-cell development, is constitutively expressed in human germinal center B-NHL and in subsets of nongerminal center B-NHL. This constitutive expression of AID may promote illegitimate DNA recombinations and somatic mutations in B-NHL.","['Greeve, Jobst', 'Philipsen, Antje', 'Krause, Kristina', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Heidorn, Klaus', 'Castle, Brian E', 'Janda, Joe', 'Marcu, Kenneth B', 'Parwaresch, Reza']","['Greeve J', 'Philipsen A', 'Krause K', 'Klapper W', 'Heidorn K', 'Castle BE', 'Janda J', 'Marcu KB', 'Parwaresch R']","['Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Medizinische Klinik I, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. jobst.greeve@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['GM26939/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM026939-21/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Exons/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Germinal Center/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2424 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50740-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3574-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2424.

As KIRs and HLA class I molecules are highly polymorphic, clinical allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is predicted to frequently involve KIR mismatch, and thus to provide a unique system for study of human NK cell receptor repertoire development. Eighteen leukemia patients undergoing HLA-matched transplantation and their donors were analyzed for KIR genotype. Ten of 13 HLA-identical donor-patient pairs were KIR mismatched and 3 were matched; all HLA-matched unrelated pairs were KIR mismatched. Reconstitution of recipient NK cell repertoire following transplantation was examined using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies specific for KIR and CD94:NKG2A. These data form 3 groups. Six to 9 months after transplantation, 8 patients (group 1) reconstituted an NK cell repertoire resembling that of their donor, and for KIR-mismatched transplants, distinct from the recipient before transplantation. In the first year after transplantation, 5 patients (group 2) exhibited a generally depressed frequency of KIR-expressing NK cells and concomitant high frequency of CD94:NKG2A expression. By 3 years after transplantation, the frequency of KIR-expressing NK cells had increased to donor values, in the 3 patients from group 2 analyzed for this period. The remaining 5 patients experienced severe clinical complications following transplantation and displayed unique features in their NK cell receptor reconstitution. These results demonstrate that a majority of HLA-matched hematopoietic cell transplantations involve KIR mismatch and reveal differences in NK cell repertoire having potential impact for immune responsiveness and transplantation outcome.","['Shilling, Heather G', 'McQueen, Karina L', 'Cheng, Nathalie W', 'Shizuru, Judith A', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Parham, Peter']","['Shilling HG', 'McQueen KL', 'Cheng NW', 'Shizuru JA', 'Negrin RS', 'Parham P']","['Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2568 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50762-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3730-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2568.

In this study, we show that HDAC inhibitors have a novel action on osteoclast differentiation. The effect of 2 HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB), on osteoclastogenesis was investigated using rat and mouse bone marrow cultures and a murine macrophage cell line RAW264. Both TSA and NaB inhibited the formation of preosteoclast-like cells (POCs) and multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (MNCs) in rat bone marrow culture. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, TSA reduced osteoclast-specific mRNA expression of cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor (CTR). In contrast, TSA and NaB did not affect the formation of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor as examined by nonspecific esterase staining. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that TSA did not affect the surface expression of macrophage markers for CD11b and F4/80 of BMMs. TSA and NaB also inhibited osteoclast formation and osteoclast-specific mRNA expression in RAW264 cells stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) ligand (RANKL). Transient transfection assay revealed that TSA and NaB dose dependently reduced the sRANKL-stimulated or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated transactivation of NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes. The treatment of RAW264 cells with TSA and NaB inhibited TNF-alpha-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and sRANKL-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals. These data suggest that both TSA and NaB exert their inhibitory effects by modulating osteoclast-specific signals and that HDAC activity regulates the process of osteoclastogenesis.","['Rahman, Md Mizanur', 'Kukita, Akiko', 'Kukita, Toshio', 'Shobuike, Takeo', 'Nakamura, Takahiro', 'Kohashi, Osamu']","['Rahman MM', 'Kukita A', 'Kukita T', 'Shobuike T', 'Nakamura T', 'Kohashi O']","['Department of Microbiology, Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitonin)', '0 (Tnfrsf11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.38 (Cathepsin K)', 'EC 3.4.22.38 (Ctsk protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.38 (Ctsk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cathepsin K', 'Cathepsins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Macrophages/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology', 'RANK Ligand', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptors, Calcitonin/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",,2003/01/04 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/01/04 04:00'],"['2003/01/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2622 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50723-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3451-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2622.

METHODS: Liver siderosis was estimated histologically from liver biopsy specimens of 30 children (aged 2.6-17.6 years) close to or at the end of therapy using total iron score (TIS). Serum iron parameters and sTfR were measured at the same time and in 22 patients 1 to 3 years after therapy. RESULTS: In 19 (63%) of 30 patients, liver TIS was >15, indicating at least moderate iron overload. Serum ferritin, iron, and transferrin iron saturation levels were highest and transferrin level lowest in the patients with the highest liver iron content. Serum sTfR levels did not differ significantly between the patients with varying amounts of liver iron. TIS correlated most significantly positively with serum ferritin (r(S) = 0.899), transferrin iron saturation (r(S) = 0.764), and the amount of transfused red blood cells (r(S) = 0.783).

Although it is clear that Notch signaling can initiate leukemogenesis, it has not previously been established whether continued NOTCH signaling is required to maintain T-ALL growth. We demonstrate here that the blockade of Notch signaling at two independent steps suppresses the growth and survival of NOTCH1-transformed T-ALL cells. First, inhibitors of presenilin specifically induce growth suppression and apoptosis of a murine T-ALL cell line that requires presenilin-dependent proteolysis of the Notch receptor in order for its intracellular domain to translocate to the nucleus. Second, a 62-amino-acid peptide derived from a NOTCH coactivator, Mastermind-like-1 (MAML1), forms a transcriptionally inert nuclear complex with NOTCH1 and CSL and specifically inhibits the growth of both murine and human NOTCH1-transformed T-ALLs. These studies show that continued growth and survival of NOTCH1-transformed lymphoid cell lines require nuclear access and transcriptional coactivator recruitment by NOTCH1 and identify at least two steps in the Notch signaling pathway as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention.","['Weng, Andrew P', 'Nam, Yunsun', 'Wolfe, Michael S', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Griffin, James D', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Weng AP', 'Nam Y', 'Wolfe MS', 'Pear WS', 'Griffin JD', 'Blacklow SC', 'Aster JC']","[""Departments of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.

This translocation results in a protein product that fuses the first 165 amino acids of core binding factor beta to the coiled-coil region of a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (CBFbeta/SMMHC). CBFbeta interacts with AML1 to form a heterodimer that binds DNA; this interaction increases the affinity of AML1 for DNA. The CBFbeta/SMMHC fusion protein cooperates with AML1 to repress the transcription of AML1-regulated genes. We show that CBFbeta/SMMHC contains a repression domain in the C-terminal 163 amino acids of the SMMHC region that is required for inv(16)-mediated transcriptional repression. This minimal repression domain is sufficient for the association of CBFbeta/SMMHC with the mSin3A corepressor. In addition, the inv(16) fusion protein specifically associates with histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). inv(16)-mediated repression is sensitive to HDAC inhibitors. We propose a model whereby the inv(16) fusion protein associates with AML1 to convert AML1 into a constitutive transcriptional repressor.","['Durst, Kristie L', 'Lutterbach, Bart', 'Kummalue, Tanawan', 'Friedman, Alan D', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Durst KL', 'Lutterbach B', 'Kummalue T', 'Friedman AD', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry.

We have found, with human medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cells, that activated Ras or c-Raf-1 can induce growth arrest by producing and secreting an autocrine-paracrine factor. This protein was purified from cell culture medium conditioned by Raf-activated MTC cells and was identified by mass spectrometry as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF expression upon Raf activation and subsequent activation of JAK-STAT3 was also observed in small cell lung carcinoma cells, suggesting that this autocrine-paracrine signaling may be a common response to Ras/Raf activation. LIF was sufficient to induce growth arrest and differentiation of MTC cells. This effect was mediated through the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway, since anti-gp130 blocking antibody or dominant-negative STAT3 blocked the effects of LIF. Thus, LIF expression provides a novel mechanism allowing Ras/Raf signaling to activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway. In addition to this cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory pathway, we find that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway induces an intracellular growth inhibitory signal, independent of the LIF/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can lead to growth arrest and differentiation via at least two different signaling pathways. This use of multiple pathways may be important for ""fail-safe"" induction and maintenance of cell cycle arrest.","['Park, Jong-In', 'Strock, Christopher J', 'Ball, Douglas W', 'Nelkin, Barry D']","['Park JI', 'Strock CJ', 'Ball DW', 'Nelkin BD']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.

However, disease progression while on STI571 therapy has been reported, suggesting de novo or intrinsic resistance to BCR-ABL-targeted therapy. To investigate possible mediators of acquired STI571 resistance, K562 cells resistant to 5 microM STI571 (K562-R) were cloned and compared to the parental cell population. K562-R cells had reduced BCR-ABL expression and limited activation of BCR-ABL signaling cascades (Stat 5, CrkL, MAPK). STI571 failed to activate caspase cascades or to suppress expression of survival genes (bcl-xL) in resistant cells. Gene sequencing and tyrosine kinase activity measurements demonstrated that K562-R cells retained wild-type and active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that was inhibitable by in vitro incubation with STI571, suggesting that BCR-ABL was not coupled to proliferation or survival of K562-R cells. The src-related kinase LYN was highly overexpressed and activated in K562-R cells, and its inhibition reduced proliferation and survival of K562-R cells while having limited effects of K562 cells. Specimens taken from patients with advanced CML that progressed on STI571 therapy also were analyzed for LYN kinase expression, and they were found to be elevated to a level similar to that of K562-R cells. Comparison of samples from patients taken prior to and following STI571 failure suggested that expression and/or activation of LYN/HCK occurs during disease progression. Together, these results suggest that acquired STI571 resistance may be associated with BCR-ABL independence and mediated in part through overexpression of other tyrosine kinases.","['Donato, Nicholas J', 'Wu, Ji Yuan', 'Stapley, Jonathan', 'Gallick, Gary', 'Lin, Hui', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Donato NJ', 'Wu JY', 'Stapley J', 'Gallick G', 'Lin H', 'Arlinghaus R', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas, M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. ndonato@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'src-Family Kinases/biosynthesis/*physiology']",,2003/01/02 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2003/01/02 04:00'],"['2003/01/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V101.2.690 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44530-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jan 15;101(2):690-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.V101.2.690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its cytotoxic effect requires an active DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. S6G is incorporated into DNA where a small fraction undergoes in situ conversion to S6-thiomethylguanine (S6meG). After replication, S6meG-containing base pairs interact with MMR. This interaction is ultimately lethal and MMR-defective cells are resistant to S6G. Here, we report that growing human cells extensively incorporate the thiopyrimidine nucleoside 4-thiothymidine (S4TdR) into their DNA. The incorporated thiopyrimidine (S4T) can also undergo facile S-methylation to 4-thiomethylthymine (S4meT). The rate of methylation of S4TdR in model substrates is similar to that for the conversion of S6G to S6meG indicating that the DNA of cells grown in S4TdR will contain significant levels of S4meT. Despite this, S4TdR is not associated with MMR-related cell death. We demonstrate that, in contrast to S6meG, neither DNA S4T nor S4meT codes ambiguously. S4T retains the coding properties of unmodified T, whereas S4meT behaves like a normal cytosine and exclusively directs the incorporation of guanine. The preferred S4meT:G base pair is also a poor substrate for binding by the hMutSalpha mismatch recognition factor. We suggest that the ability of S4meT to produce a structurally acceptable base pair during replication underlies the absence of MMR-related death in cells treated with S4TdR.","['Massey, Andrew', 'Xu, Yao Zhong', 'Karran, Peter']","['Massey A', 'Xu YZ', 'Karran P']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Herts, EN6 3LD, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['0 (4-thiothymidine)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Base Pair Mismatch/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames/physiology', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Thymine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/02 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2003/01/02 04:00'],"['2003/01/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1568786402000046 [pii]', '10.1016/s1568-7864(02)00004-6 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2002 Apr 29;1(4):275-86. doi: 10.1016/s1568-7864(02)00004-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to investigate the effect of antisense oligonucleotides of CRKL gene (CRKL-ASDON) on CML K562 cell lines. METHODS: K562 cells were transfected with CRKL-ASDON, using liposome as the vector. The changes of cell morphology, cell cycle, and gene expression were observed through living cell count, transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM), DNA Ladder assay. RESULTS: Under the action of CRKL-ASDON, growth of K562 cell was markedly inhibited. An apoptotic peak appeared before diploid peak in FCM; various apoptotic stages of K562 cells were observed under electron microscope; over ladder-shaped band of cell apoptosis was seen in abstracted DNA of the gene group by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the above changes did not appear in the control.

To clarify this mechanism, we (i). assembled the sequence of RARA intron 2, (ii). amplified and sequenced the genomic PML-RARA junction sequences from 37 APL patients, and (iii). amplified and sequenced the reverse RARA-PML genomic fusion in 29 of these cases. Three significant breakpoint microclusters within RARA intron 2 were identified, suggesting that sequence-associated or structural factors play a role in the formation of the t(15;17). There was no evidence that the location of a breakpoint in PML had any relationship to the location of the corresponding breakpoint in RARA. Although some sequence motifs previously implicated in illegitimate recombinations were found in the microcluster regions, these associations were not significant. Comparison of forward and reverse genomic junctions revealed microhomologies, deletions, and/or duplications of either gene in all but one case, in which a complex rearrangement with inversion of the PML-derived sequence was found. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the t(15;17) occurs by nonhomologous recombination of DNA after processing of the double-strand breaks by a dysfunctional DNA damage-repair mechanism.","['Reiter, Andreas', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Grimwade, David', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Segal, Mark R', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Walz, Christoph', 'Weisser, Andreas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Willer, Andreas', 'Reichert, Anja', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Reiter A', 'Saussele S', 'Grimwade D', 'Wiemels JL', 'Segal MR', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Walz C', 'Weisser A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Willer A', 'Reichert A', 'Buchner T', 'Lengfelder E', 'Hehlmann R', 'Cross NC']","['III.

Both the original leukemic cells and the Kasumi-6 cell line harbor a hemizygous point mutation in the gene encoding the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a critical myeloid transcriptional factor. The C to G transition at nucleotide 1063 of the C/EBPalpha gene results in amino acid transition R305P in the fork or hinge region between the DNA-binding basic region and the leucine zipper dimerization domain of the C/EBPalpha protein. The Kasumi-6 cells expressed both the p42 and p30 isoforms of the C/EBPalpha protein endogenously, but electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated an absence of C/EBPalpha binding to its respective site. Exogenous expression of the mutant form of C/EBPalpha demonstrated that it was unable to bind DNA and activate transcription from a G-CSF receptor-luciferase reporter construct. Furthermore, coexpression of the wild-type and mutant forms revealed that the mutant form repressed reporter gene activation by the wild type in a dose-responsive manner. This was concomitant with a dose-responsive decrease in wild-type protein binding to the G-CSF receptor C/EBP site. The data suggest that the R305P alteration confers a dominant-negative property on the mutant C/EBPalpha protein whereby the mutant polypeptide heterodimerizes with the wild-type polypeptide and prevents it from binding to DNA, thus blocking transcriptional activation. The Kasumi-6 cell line can serve as a model to study the cellular and molecular biology of the non-t(8;21) M2 type of myeloid leukemia and can elucidate the role of mutated C/EBPalpha in leukemogenesis.","['Asou, Hiroya', 'Gombart, Adrian F', 'Takeuchi, Seisho', 'Tanaka, Hideo', 'Tanioka, Maki', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kimura, Akiro', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Asou H', 'Gombart AF', 'Takeuchi S', 'Tanaka H', 'Tanioka M', 'Matsui H', 'Kimura A', 'Inaba T', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology & Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. asobu@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['CA26038-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Genes, Dominant/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells/metabolism']",,2003/01/01 04:00,2003/02/22 04:00,['2003/01/01 04:00'],"['2003/01/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10161 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Feb;36(2):167-74. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10161.,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although recruitment of proteins through interferon-induced upregulation and SUMO-1 modification level of PML had been defined, it is not known whether release of proteins is regulated and has physiological consequences. Exposure to sublethal environmental stress revealed a sequential release of ND10-associated proteins. Upon heat shock Daxx and Sp100 were released but PML remained, whereas exposure to subtoxic concentrations of CdCl(2) induced the release of ND10-associated proteins, including PML, with Sp100 remaining in a few sites. In both cases, recovery times were similar and were followed by a burst of mitotic activity. Cadmium-induced release of proteins from ND10 could be blocked by inhibiting activation of p38 MAPK or ERK1/2. By contrast, heat-shock-induced desumolation of PML and release of proteins from ND10 are unaffected by these inhibitors but can be recapitulated by overexpression of the SUMO isopeptidase SENP-1. Therefore, activation of SENP-1-like SUMO isopeptidase(s) during heat shock is not affected by these kinases. Thus, the release of ND10-associated proteins is not due to a general dispersal of nuclear domains but seems to be regulated by rapid desumolation during thermal stress and through the phosphorylation cascade of stress and mitogenic signaling pathways in the case of CdCl(2). Whether the release of certain proteins had consequences was tested for heat-shock-protein transcription and synthesis. Release of Daxx correlated with Hsp25 suppression, suggesting that Daxx normally inhibits immediate Hsp25 production. Release of PML correlated with lower production of Hsp70. These results suggest that segregation or release of PML or Daxx have differential physiological relevance during the stress response. The fact that enzymatic activation of protein release or segregation after stress modifies the heat-shock response strengthens the concept of ND10 as a regulated depot of effector proteins.","['Nefkens, Isabelle', 'Negorev, Dmitri G', 'Ishov, Alexander M', 'Michaelson, Jennifer S', 'Yeh, Edward T H', 'Tanguay, Robert M', 'Muller, Werner E G', 'Maul, Gerd G']","['Nefkens I', 'Negorev DG', 'Ishov AM', 'Michaelson JS', 'Yeh ET', 'Tanguay RM', 'Muller WE', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hsbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (SENP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat-Shock Response/drug effects/*physiology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/01/01 04:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/01/01 04:00'],"['2003/01/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/jcs.00253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Feb 1;116(Pt 3):513-24. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of this process is an important molecular event which has been shown to be associated with neoplastic transformation and tumour progression in humans and mice. Features of methylation dysregulation in many different types of neoplasms include general genomic hypomethylation, focal hypermethylation, and altered expression of genes which encode a series of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases. Interestingly, many types of neoplasia that are recognised in humans also develop spontaneously in the dog. By comparing the restriction patterns of MspI and HpaII, this study demonstrates that as in human, genomic hypomethylation is a feature of neoplastic cells in the majority of canine lymphoma cases and approximately one-third of canine leukemia cases confirming that dysregulation of the DNA methylating machinery is implicated in malignant transformation of lymphoid cells in some dogs.","['Pelham, J T', 'Irwin, P J', 'Kay, P H']","['Pelham JT', 'Irwin PJ', 'Kay PH']","['Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, The University of Western Australia, WA 6009, Nedlands, Australia. nellpini@cyllene.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Res Vet Sci,Research in veterinary science,0401300,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Dog Diseases/*genetics', 'Dogs', '*Genome', 'Leukemia/genetics/veterinary', 'Lymphoma/genetics/veterinary', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*veterinary']",,2003/01/01 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/01/01 04:00'],"['2003/01/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0034528802001790 [pii]', '10.1016/s0034-5288(02)00179-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Vet Sci. 2003 Feb;74(1):101-4. doi: 10.1016/s0034-5288(02)00179-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to examine progesterone metabolites to understand the overall bioactive properties of this sex steroid. However, progesterone metabolism has not been examined in human immune cells. The human leukemic monoblast U937 cell line exhibits monocytic lineage and provides a valuable model to analyze monocyte-macrophage differentiation. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed progesterone metabolism in U937 cells by thin-layer chromatography. Progesterone was metabolized to 5alpha-pregnan-3beta,6alpha-diol-20-one via 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 5alpha-pregnan-3beta-ol-20-one, and 5alpha-pregnan-3beta,20alpha-diol was also detected as a final metabolic product via 20alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 5alpha-pregnan-20alpha-ol-3-one. 5alpha-reduction (5alpha-reductase type 1) and 20alpha-reduction were involved in the first step of metabolism. To identify the enzyme responsible for the 20alpha-reduction, we screened an U937 cDNA library, and obtained a clone (1.2 kb), which was identical to the human hepatic bile acid-binding protein or 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20alpha-HSD). 293 cells transfected with this cDNA demonstrated marked 20alpha-reduction of progesterone to 20alphaDHP, but 20alpha-oxidative, 3alpha-HSD or 17beta-HSD activity was found to be negligible. In experimental animals, the importance of 20alpha-HSD has been reported to be involved in the protection of immune cells from the toxic effects of progesterone. Therefore, our present data suggest that 20alpha-HSD plays an important role in the regulation of progesterone actions in human immune cells.","['Suzuki, Takashi', 'Murry, Barbara A', 'Darnel, Andrew D', 'Sasano, Hironobu']","['Suzuki T', 'Murry BA', 'Darnel AD', 'Sasano H']","['Department of Pathology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.149 (20-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics/metabolism', '20-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/01/01 04:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/01/01 04:00'],"['2003/01/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1507/endocrj.49.539 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr J. 2002 Oct;49(5):539-46. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.49.539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all childhood cancers combined were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94, 1.06), 0.72 (95% CI = 0.43, 1.12), and 1.25 (95% CI = 0.91, 1.69) for low-, medium-, and high-exposure counties, respectively.

The excess in 5- to 9-yr-old children and 10- to 14-yr-old children was in bone cancers, and the excess in 15- to 19-yr-old young adults was primarily in lymphomas.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) compared two contrasting approaches: a single agent, and combination chemotherapy capable of curing diffuse aggressive lymphomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 228 patients with stage III or IV FSCL or FML were randomized to cyclophosphamide or the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-B). Treatment was continued in responders for 2 years beyond maximal response. The primary end point was survival in the most common subtype, FSCL. RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of all patients responded; complete responses were seen in 66% of those treated with cyclophosphamide and in 60% treated with CHOP-B (P =.36). At 10 years with either cyclophosphamide or CHOP-B, respectively, overall time to failure (25% failure free v 33%; P =.107) and survival (44% alive v 46%; P =.79) were similar by treatment. Outcomes in FSCL also were similar. In 46 patients with FML, at 10 years the combination was associated with better failure-free (9% v 48%; P =.005) and overall (25% v 61%; P =.024) survival. Acute toxic effects were more common with combination chemotherapy. Second malignancies, which might be attributed to treatment, were seen with both approaches. CONCLUSION: There is no advantage to the initial use of the relatively intensive combination, CHOP-B, for patients with FSCL compared with the less toxic single agent, cyclophosphamide. However, in an unplanned subgroup analysis, patients with FML who received the combination experienced improved disease control and survival.","['Peterson, Bruce A', 'Petroni, Gina R', 'Frizzera, Glauco', 'Barcos, Maurice', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Nissen, Nis I', 'Hurd, David D', 'Henderson, Edward S', 'Sartiano, George P', 'Johnson, Jeffrey L', 'Holland, James F', 'Gottlieb, Arlan J']","['Peterson BA', 'Petroni GR', 'Frizzera G', 'Barcos M', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Nissen NI', 'Hurd DD', 'Henderson ES', 'Sartiano GP', 'Johnson JL', 'Holland JF', 'Gottlieb AJ']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. peter001@umn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP-B protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/jco.2003.05.128 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 1;21(1):5-15. doi: 10.1200/jco.2003.05.128.,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jan 1;21(1):1-2.

Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms controlling induction of apoptosis and subsequent cellular disintegration could result in improved methods for prognosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we have examined apoptosis-induced alterations in two proteins, nucleolin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), in U937 leukemia cells. Nucleolin is expressed at high levels in malignant cells, and it is a multifunctional and mobile protein that can shuttle among the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. Here, we report our findings that UV irradiation or camptothecin treatment of U937 cells induced apoptosis and caused a significant change in the levels and localization of nucleolin within the nucleus. Additionally, nucleolin levels were dramatically decreased in extracts containing the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. These alterations could be abrogated by pre-incubation with an inhibitor of PARP-1 (3-aminobenzamide), and our data support a potential role for nucleolin in removing cleaved PARP-1 from dying cells. Furthermore, both nucleolin and cleaved PARP-1 were detected in the culture medium of cells undergoing apoptosis, associated with particles of a size consistent with apoptotic bodies. These results indicate that nucleolin plays an important role in apoptosis, and could be a useful marker for assessing apoptosis or detecting apoptotic bodies. In addition, the data provide a possible explanation for the appearance of nucleolin and PARP-1 autoantibodies in some autoimmune diseases.","['Mi, Yingchang', 'Thomas, Shelia D', 'Xu, Xiaohua', 'Casson, Lavona K', 'Miller, Donald M', 'Bates, Paula J']","['Mi Y', 'Thomas SD', 'Xu X', 'Casson LK', 'Miller DM', 'Bates PJ']","['Molecular Targets Group, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207637200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86486-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 7;278(10):8572-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207637200.

HTLV-1 induces Fuc-T VII transcription through the viral transactivator Tax, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the role of the cis-activating element in Tax activation using reporter constructs bearing the 5'-regulatory region of Fuc-T VII in Jurkat T cells. A sequence (GGCTGTGGGGGCGTCATATTGCCCTGG) covering a half-palindromic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element (CRE) was found to be required for Tax activation of the Fuc-T VII promoter. We further demonstrated that transcription factors of the CRE-binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family bind to this CRE-like sequence and that Tax binds in association with CREB and the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in Jurkat T cells. This element, containing the G+C-rich flanking sequences, is homologous to the Tax-responsive viral CREs in the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter. Furthermore, CREM alpha, an isoform of CREB deficient in the glutamine-rich domains, was found to activate the Fuc-T VII promoter in a phosphorylation-independent manner, similar to the viral CRE in HTLV-1 LTR but in contrast to the phosphorylation-dependent activation of the cellular CREs by Tax. These findings indicate that the Fuc-T VII promoter is transactivated by Tax in concert with CBP through a CRE-like sequence in a manner similar to that of viral CRE in HTLV-1 LTR.","['Hiraiwa, Nozomu', 'Yabuta, Tomonori', 'Yoritomi, Keijiro', 'Hiraiwa, Miki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Suzuki, Takeshi', 'Yoshida, Mitsuaki', 'Kannagi, Reiji']","['Hiraiwa N', 'Yabuta T', 'Yoritomi K', 'Hiraiwa M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Yoshida M', 'Kannagi R']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/enzymology/virology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Second Messenger Systems/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2301 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50746-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3615-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2301.

Because cholesterol is a product of this pathway, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Statins are also toxic to several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although this toxicity has been attributed to the inhibition of Ras/Rho isoprenylation, we have previously shown that statin toxicity in primary AML cells (AMLs) does not correlate with Ras isoprenylation or with activating Ras mutations. In other studies, we have shown that hypoxic and oxidant injuries induce cholesterol increments in renal tubule cells and that statins sensitize these cells to injury by blocking protective cholesterol responses. We now demonstrate that exposing particular AMLs to radiochemotherapy induces much greater cellular cholesterol increments than those seen in similarly treated normal bone marrow. Treatment of these AMLs with mevastatin or zaragozic acid (which inhibits cholesterol synthesis but not isoprenoid synthesis) attenuates the cholesterol increments and sensitizes cells to radiochemotherapy. The extent of toxicity is affected by the availability of extracellular lipoproteins, further suggesting that cellular cholesterol is critical to cell survival in particular AMLs. Because zaragozic acid does not inhibit isoprenoid synthesis, these data suggest that cholesterol modulation is an important mechanism whereby statins exert toxic effects on some AMLs and that cholesterol modulators may improve therapeutic ratios in AML by impacting cholesterol-dependent cytoresistance.","['Li, Henry Y', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Zager, Richard A', 'Banker, Deborah E']","['Li HY', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL', 'Zager RA', 'Banker DE']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK38432/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL07093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1-CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Tricarboxylic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1117HVX02L (squalestatin 1)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cholesterol/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Lipids/physiology', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tricarboxylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2283 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50748-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3628-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2283.

Recently, we have generated an HTLV-I surface glycoprotein (SU) immunoadhesin, HTSU-IgG, which binds specifically to cell-surface protein(s) critical for HTLV-I-mediated entry in cell lines. Here, expression of the HTLV-I SU binding protein on primary cells of the immune system was examined. The immunoadhesin specifically bound to adult T cells, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages. Cell stimulation dramatically increased the amount of binding, with the highest levels of binding on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Naive (CD45RA(high), CD62L(high)) CD4(+) T cells derived from cord blood cells, in contrast to other primary cells and all cell lines examined, bound no detectable HTLV-I SU. However, following stimulation, the level of HTSU-IgG binding was rapidly induced (fewer than 6 hours), reaching the level of binding seen on adult CD4(+) T cells by 72 hours. In contrast to HTLV-I virions, the soluble HTSU-IgG did not effect T-cell activation or proliferation. When incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction, HTSU-IgG inhibited proliferation at less than 1 ng/mL. These results indicate that cell-surface expression of the HTLV SU binding protein is up-regulated during in vitro activation and suggest a role for the HTLV-I SU binding proteins in the immunobiology of CD4(+) T cells.","['Nath, Manisha D', 'Ruscetti, Francis W', 'Petrow-Sadowski, Cari', 'Jones, Kathryn S']","['Nath MD', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Petrow-Sadowski C', 'Jones KS']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, National Institutes of Health, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HTLV-I receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/immunology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2277 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50806-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3085-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2277.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells responsible for the initiation of immune responses. In CML patients, up to 98% of myeloid DCs generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells are BCR-ABL positive. In this study we have compared the morphology and behavior of myeloid DCs derived from CML patients with control DCs from healthy individuals. We show that the actin cytoskeleton and shape of CML-DCs of myeloid origin adherent to fibronectin differ significantly from those of normal DCs. CML-DCs are also defective in processing and presentation of exogenous antigens such as tetanus toxoid. The antigen-processing defect may be a consequence of the reduced capacity of CML-DCs to capture antigen via macropinocytosis or via mannose receptors when compared with DCs generated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, chemokine-induced migration of CML-DCs in vitro was significantly reduced. These observations cannot be explained by a difference in the maturation status of CML and normal DCs, because phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry showed a similar surface expression of maturation makers. Taken together, these results suggest that the defects in antigen processing and migration we have observed in CML-DCs may be related to underlying cytoskeletal changes induced by the p210(BCR-ABL) fusion protein.","['Dong, Rong', 'Cwynarski, Kate', 'Entwistle, Alan', 'Marelli-Berg, Federica', 'Dazzi, Francesco', 'Simpson, Elizabeth', 'Goldman, John M', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Lechler, Robert I', 'Bellantuono, Ilaria', 'Ridley, Anne', 'Lombardi, Giovanna']","['Dong R', 'Cwynarski K', 'Entwistle A', 'Marelli-Berg F', 'Dazzi F', 'Simpson E', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV', 'Lechler RI', 'Bellantuono I', 'Ridley A', 'Lombardi G']","['Department of Immunology, Division of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannose Receptor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*ultrastructure', 'Actins/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cytoskeleton/*ultrastructure', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Endocytosis', 'Fibronectins', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mannose Receptor', '*Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Pinocytosis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/immunology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1841 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50738-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3560-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1841.

In the present study, we investigated the sensitivity of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemia cell lines to TRAIL- or FasL-induced cell death to explore the possible contribution of these molecules to immunotherapy against Ph1-positive leukemias. TRAIL, but not FasL, effectively induced apoptotic cell death in most of 5 chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived and 7 acute leukemia-derived Ph1-positive cell lines. The sensitivity to TRAIL was correlated with cell-surface expression of death-inducing receptors DR4 and/or DR5. The TRAIL-induced cell death was caspase-dependent and enhanced by nuclear factor kappa B inhibitors. Moreover, primary leukemia cells from Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were also sensitive to TRAIL, but not to FasL, depending on DR4/DR5 expression. Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8, components of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), as well as FLIP (FLICE [Fas-associating protein with death domain-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme]/caspase-8 inhibitory protein), a negative regulator of caspase-8, were expressed ubiquitously in Ph1-positive leukemia cell lines irrespective of their differential sensitivities to TRAIL and FasL. Notably, TRAIL could induce cell death in the Ph1-positive leukemia cell lines that were refractory to a BCR-ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571; Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland). These results suggested the potential utility of recombinant TRAIL as a novel therapeutic agent and the possible contribution of endogenously expressed TRAIL to immunotherapy against Ph1-positive leukemias.","['Uno, Kanako', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Kayagaki, Nobuhiko', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Sato, Hiroki', 'Nemoto, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Kazuya', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Yamaguchi, Noriko', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Okumura, Ko', 'Koyama-Okazaki, Toshiko', 'Suzuki, Toshio', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Nakazawa, Shinpei']","['Uno K', 'Inukai T', 'Kayagaki N', 'Goi K', 'Sato H', 'Nemoto A', 'Takahashi K', 'Kagami K', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Yagita H', 'Okumura K', 'Koyama-Okazaki T', 'Suzuki T', 'Sugita K', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Nakakoma, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SN50 peptide)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '110044-82-1 (acetylleucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Caspase 1/physiology', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/physiology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1770 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50752-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3658-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1770.

Recently, it was demonstrated that transgenic mice specifically lacking JunB expression in the myeloid lineage developed a myeloproliferative disease, eventually progressing to blast crisis that resembled human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To gain further insights into the role of JunB in human CML, we examined peripheral blood from 17 healthy individuals and CML patients (11 in blastic crisis and 21 in chronic phase) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis for the expression of JunB. The results showed the expression levels of JunB were significantly impaired in CML cases (blastic crisis < chronic phase < normal). Mutational analysis of the whole gene and methylation analysis of cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) sites at the promoter area were further performed to investigate the possible mechanisms. However, no mutation was found within the coding region or the 9 flanking evolutionarily conserved regions in all CML cases. Interestingly, in the promoter area of JunB gene, most of the CpG sites were methylated in CML cases; in contrast, none of these CpG sites were methylated in normal cases. Demethylation by treatment of hypermethylated K562 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in partial reactivation of JunB expression. Our results suggest that the down-regulated JunB expression in CML was due to the inactivation of JunB gene by methylation and the differential expression was correlated to the ratio of cells being methylated.","['Yang, Ming-Yu', 'Liu, Ta-Chih', 'Chang, Jan-Gowth', 'Lin, Pai-Mei', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung']","['Yang MY', 'Liu TC', 'Chang JG', 'Lin PM', 'Lin SF']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Computer Systems', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1598 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50822-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3205-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1598.

Bone marrow eosinophilia and basophilia were defined as a differential count of each cell type exceeding 5.0% and 1.0%, respectively. Of 288 patients with MDS, 36 (12.5%) fulfilled this criterion for bone marrow eosinophilia (MDS-Eos); 34 patients (11.8%) showed basophilia (MDS-Bas), and 11 (3.8%) satisfied both criteria (MDS-EosBas). The remaining 229 patients had neither eosinophilia nor basophilia in their bone marrow (MDS(-/-)) at presentation. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out on unstimulated bone marrow cells obtained from 264 patients. When the cytogenetic categorization of the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) for MDS was applied, significantly higher numbers of MDS-Eos and MDS-Bas patients had chromosomal abnormalities carrying intermediate or poor prognosis, compared with the MDS(-/-) patients. Specific chromosomal abnormalities and complex karyotypes were associated with MDS-Eos and/or MDS-Bas. In accordance with these results, the overall survival rate was significantly lower, and the evolution to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) occurred more frequently in the MDS-Eos and MDS-Bas than in the MDS(-/-) patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that bone marrow basophilia was an independent risk factor for evolution to AML.

An additional role for PML as a regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation has been proposed in a murine model, which would account for evasion from host immunity of tumors bearing malfunctioning PML, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we investigated a possible role of PML for the control MHC class I expression in human cells. PML function was perturbed in human cell lines either by PML/RAR alpha transfection or by PML- specific RNA interference. Impairment of wild-type PML function was proved by a microspeckled disassembly of nuclear bodies (NBs), where the protein is normally localized, or by their complete disappearance. However, no MHC class I down-regulation was observed in both instances. We next constructed a PML mutant, PML mut ex3, that is a human homolog of the murine PML mutant, truncated in exon 3, that was shown to down-regulate murine MHC class I. PML mut ex3 transfected in human cell lines exerted a dominant-negative effect since no PML molecules were detected in NBs but, instead, in perinuclear and cytoplasmic larger dot-like structures. Nevertheless, no down-regulation of MHC class I expression was evident. Moreover, neither transfection with PML mut ex3 nor PML-specific RNA interference affected the ability of gamma-interferon to up-regulate MHC class I expression. We conclude that, in human cell lines, PML is not involved directly in the regulation of MHC class I expression.","['Bruno, Silvia', 'Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Fais, Franco', 'Fagioli, Marta', 'Luzi, Lucilla', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Grossi, Carlo Enrico', 'Ciccone, Ermanno']","['Bruno S', 'Ghiotto F', 'Fais F', 'Fagioli M', 'Luzi L', 'Pelicci PG', 'Grossi CE', 'Ciccone E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Human Anatomy, Genoa University, Genoa, Italy. silvia.bruno@unige.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Dominant', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Organelles', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3335 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50732-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3514-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3335.

Our initial molecular genetic analyses in 2 off-treatment relapses suggested that the initial and relapse clones represent different subclones that evolved from a common TEL/AML1-positive, treatment-resistant precursor. In order to further elaborate on this hypothesis, we studied 2 patients with late systemic relapses of their TEL/AML1-positive ALL (41 months and 49 months after initial diagnosis, respectively) who had distinct clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements at diagnosis and relapse. These clone-specific markers enabled us to determine the responsiveness of the individual clones to treatment. The matching genomic TEL/AML1 breakpoints of the initial and the relapse clones in these patients confirmed their origin from a common progenitor cell. This proof was especially important in one of these 2 leukemias without a common antigen receptor gene rearrangement. Our retrospective analysis revealed that in both cases the relapse clone was already present at diagnosis. Despite their small sizes (5 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-4), respectively), we were able to detect their much slower responses to therapy compared with the dominant leukemic clone. Moreover, in all instances, these initially slow-responding clones, after they had developed into the relapse leukemia, were rapidly eradicated by the relapse treatment, underlining their different biology at the 2 time points of leukemia manifestation. We thus hypothesize that the minor clone was not fully malignant at initial diagnosis but acquired further mutations that may be necessary for the manifestation of relapse.","['Konrad, Marianne', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Panzer, Simon', 'Ostreicher, Iris', 'Peham, Martina', 'Repp, Reinald', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E Renate']","['Konrad M', 'Metzler M', 'Panzer S', 'Ostreicher I', 'Peham M', 'Repp R', 'Haas OA', 'Gadner H', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute and St Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3252 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50749-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3635-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3252.

Multidimensional flow cytometry employing a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies enables the detection of small numbers of occult leukemic cells that persist during therapy using technology adaptable by most clinical laboratories. We performed a prospective, blinded evaluation of bone marrow specimens obtained from 252 pediatric patients with de novo AML to determine whether detection of occult leukemia defined as more than or equal to 0.5% blasts with aberrant surface antigen expression as determined by flow cytometry was predictive of subsequent relapse. Occult leukemia was detected in 41 (16%) of the 252 patients who responded to initial induction therapy. In time-dependent multivariate analyses that controlled for allogeneic marrow transplantation, variable intervals between sample submission, age, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis, presence of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, and presence of more than 15% blasts in the marrow after the first course of induction, patients harboring occult leukemia were 4.8 times more likely to relapse (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8 to 8.4, P <.0001) and 3.1 times more likely to die (95% CI; 1.9 to 5.1, P <.0001) than those lacking leukemia detectable by flow cytometry.

Among patients in whom a marrow sample was available for analysis at the end of consolidation therapy, overall survival at 3 years was 41% versus 69% for patients with and without occult leukemia, respectively (P =.0058).","['Sievers, Eric L', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Bernstein, Irwin D', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Woods, William G', 'Loken, Michael R']","['Sievers EL', 'Lange BJ', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Bernstein ID', 'Smith FO', 'Arceci RJ', 'Woods WG', 'Loken MR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; the Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. esievers@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['CA10382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DCTER protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3064 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50715-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3398-406. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3064.

Because PML has been shown to form transcription-regulatory complexes with various molecules, we speculated that PML and/or PML/RAR alpha might affect signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity, which plays a crucial role in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced growth and survival of myeloid cells. In luciferase assays, PML inhibited STAT3 activity in NIH3T3, 293T, HepG2, and 32D cells. PML formed a complex with STAT3 through B-box and COOH terminal regions in vitro and in vivo, thereby inhibiting its DNA binding activity. Although PML/RAR alpha did not interact with STAT3, it dissociated PML from STAT3 and restored its activity suppressed by PML. To assess the biologic significance of these findings, we introduced PML and PML/RAR alpha into interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells expressing the chimeric receptor composed of extracellular domain of G-CSF-R and cytoplasmic domain of gp130, in which gp130-mediated growth is essentially dependent on STAT3 activity. Neither PML nor PML/RAR alpha affected IL-3-dependent growth of these clones. By contrast, gp130-mediated growth was abrogated by PML, whereas it was enhanced by PML/RAR alpha. These results reveal new functions of PML and PML/RAR alpha and suggest that dysregulated STAT3 activity by PML/RAR alpha may participate in the pathogenesis of APL.","['Kawasaki, Akira', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Kataoka, Yoshihisa', 'Takigawa, Eri', 'Nakajima, Koichi', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Kawasaki A', 'Matsumura I', 'Kataoka Y', 'Takigawa E', 'Nakajima K', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*etiology/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2474 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50753-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 1;101(9):3668-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2474.

We investigated the processes controlling PBX1 nuclear export. Here we show that in the absence of MEINOX proteins nuclear export is not a default pathway for PBX1 subcellular localization. In different cell backgrounds, PBX1 can be imported or exported from the nucleus independently of its capacity to interact with MEINOX proteins. The cell context-specific balance between nuclear export and import of PBX1 is controlled by the PBC-B domain, which contains several conserved serine residues corresponding to phosphorylation sites for Ser/Thr kinases. PBX1 subcellular localization correlates with the phosphorylation state of these residues whose dephosphorylation induces nuclear export. Protein kinase A (PKA) specifically phosphorylates PBX1 at these serines, and stimulation of endogenous PKA activity in vivo blocks PBX1 nuclear export in distal limb mesenchymal cells. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of PBX1 nuclear export in addition to the absence of MEINOX protein, which involves the inhibition of PKA-mediated phosphorylation at specific sites within the PBC-B domain.","['Kilstrup-Nielsen, Charlotte', 'Alessio, Massimo', 'Zappavigna, Vincenzo']","['Kilstrup-Nielsen C', 'Alessio M', 'Zappavigna V']","['Transcriptional Regulation in Development, DIBIT H San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['E.1026/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC140055,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdg010 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2003 Jan 2;22(1):89-99. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdg010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is primarily consequent to the identification and functional characterization of MHC-specific inhibitory receptors that allow NK cells to discriminate between normal cells and potentially harmful cells that have lost or express insufficient amounts of MHC class I molecules. More recently, a number of activating receptors or coreceptors have been identified that are involved in the process of natural cytotoxicity but may also play a role in the direct recognition of pathogen-associated structures. Surprisingly, none of the triggering receptors identified in NK cells appears to be involved in the ""NK-like activity"" of a subset of CD8(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes. In this case, lysis of NK-susceptible tumor target cells is the result of the TCR alpha/beta-mediated recognition of HLA-E. The potent cytolytic activity of NK cells as well as their unique mode of functioning may be exploited in therapy. An important breakthrough is the recent report that ""alloreactive"" NK cells, generated in haploidentical bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute myeloid leukemias, may efficiently prevent leukemic relapses as well as graft rejection and graft-vs.-host disease. This may lead to a true revolution in bone marrow transplantation, based on the exploitation of appropriate HLA-Cl I mismatches that can put NK cells in action.","['Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Biassoni, Roberto', 'Bottino, Cristina', 'Cantoni, Claudia', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Alessandro']","['Moretta L', 'Biassoni R', 'Bottino C', 'Cantoni C', 'Pende D', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta A']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy. lorenzomoretta@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD244 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1286457902000370 [pii]', '10.1016/s1286-4579(02)00037-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2002 Dec;4(15):1539-44. doi: 10.1016/s1286-4579(02)00037-0.,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although mercury chloride (HgCl(2)) is known to induce apoptosis in various immune system cells, the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the activation of caspase-3, an important cysteine aspartic protease, during HgCl(2)-induced apoptosis in a human leukemia cell line (HL-60 cells). Both DNA fragmentation, a characteristic of apoptotic cells, and proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate of caspase-3, occurred at 6 h after HgCl(2) treatment in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the activation of caspase-3 was involved in HgCl(2)-induced apoptosis. The release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria into the cytosol, which is an initiator of the activation of caspase cascades, was also observed in HgCl(2)-treated HL-60 cells. Moreover, the release of Cyt c from mitochondria was observed in HgCl(2)-treated mitochondria isolated from mice liver, and this was followed by mitochondrial permeability transition (PT). The PT was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent inhibitor of PT. CsA also suppressed the occurrence of DNA fragmentation induced by HgCl(2) treatment in HL-60 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that HgCl(2) is a potent inducer of apoptosis via Cyt c release from the mitochondria in HL-60 cells.","['Araragi, Saeko', 'Kondoh, Masuo', 'Kawase, Masaki', 'Saito, Sayaka', 'Higashimoto, Minoru', 'Sato, Masao']","['Araragi S', 'Kondoh M', 'Kawase M', 'Saito S', 'Higashimoto M', 'Sato M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/ethnology/*pathology', 'Mercuric Chloride/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/pharmacology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0300483X02004432 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00443-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2003 Feb 14;184(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(02)00443-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These analogues are pro-drugs and must be activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). The CdA and CAFdA resistant cell lines exhibited increased resistance to the other nucleoside analogues activated by dCK. This was also the case for the Fara-A resistant cells, except that they were sensitive to CAFdA and guanosine analogues. The CdA and CAFdA resistant cells displayed a deficiency in dCK activity (to <5%) while the Fara-A resistant cells showed only a minor reduction of dCK activity (20% reduction). The activity of high K(m) 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) (cN-II) using IMP as substrate, was 2-fold elevated in the resistant cell lines. The amount of the small subunit R2 of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) was higher in the Fara-A resistant cells, which translated into a higher RR activity, while CdA and CAFdA cells had decreased activity compared to the parental cells. Expression of the recently identified RR subunit, p53R2 full-size protein, in CAFdA cells was low compared to parental cells, but a protein of lower molecular weight was detected in CdA and CAFdA cells. Co-incubation of Fara-A with the RR inhibitor 3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid (didox) enhanced cytotoxicity in the Fara-A resistant cells by a factors of 20. Exposure of the cells to the nucleoside analogues studied here also caused structural and numerical instability of the chromosomes; the most profound changes were recorded for CAFdA cells, as demonstrated by SKY and CGH analysis. We conclude that down-regulation of dCK in cells resistant to CdA and CAFdA and increased activity of RR in cells resistant to Fara-A contribute to resistance.","['Mansson, Emma', 'Flordal, Emma', 'Liliemark, Jan', 'Spasokoukotskaja, Tatiana', 'Elford, Howard', 'Lagercrantz, Svetlana', 'Eriksson, Staffan', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Mansson E', 'Flordal E', 'Liliemark J', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Elford H', 'Lagercrantz S', 'Eriksson S', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytogenetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202014843 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01484-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Jan 15;65(2):237-47. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01484-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dose- and time-dependent elevation of both PAR formation as assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis and DNA damage as assessed by the comet assay were observed after treatment with EGCG at 20, 40 and 80 microM for 10-240 min. Maximum levels of PAR formation and of DNA damage were observed after 10 min at all concentrations tested. Increased PAR levels were still detectable by 240 min in the 40 and 80 microM groups. At the lowest concentration, which is near the physiological peak values found after tea ingestion, PAR formation was not correlated with DNA damage. Here, EGCG led to pronounced PAR levels, whereas the comet assay was almost negative. In contrast, such marked differences in time course and extent of both genotoxicity and PAR formation following EGCG treatment were not detected after gamma-irradiation. Our results suggest that the known chemopreventive effects of EGCG, the main constituent of tea, may be partly attributed to an induction of PAR formation.","['Bertram, Barbara', 'Bollow, Ursula', 'Rajaee-Behbahani, Nahid', 'Burkle, Alexander', 'Schmezer, Peter']","['Bertram B', 'Bollow U', 'Rajaee-Behbahani N', 'Burkle A', 'Schmezer P']","['Division of Toxicology and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. b.bertram@dkfz.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Toxicity Tests']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571802002450 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00245-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2003 Jan 10;534(1-2):77-84. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(02)00245-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to identify the effect of ethnic group on the incidence and temporal trends of childhood cancer in Bradford. Children (0-14 years) from the district of Bradford, who were diagnosed with a malignancy between 1974 and 1997, were selected from a population-based register. Each child was classified as south Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi), or not, based on their full name using 2 computer algorithms and individual inspection. Mid-year population estimates were used to calculate incidence rates and differences were assessed using Poisson regression. The study included 318 children, of whom 81 (25%) were south Asian. The incidence of all cancers in south Asian children (14.9 per 100,000 person years, 95% CI 11.6-18.2) was higher than non-south Asian children (12.0, 10.5-13.5) although not significantly so (P=0.14). Comparisons by diagnostic subgroup showed no major differences apart from significantly higher rates of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in south Asian children (1.9 versus 0.7, P=0.02). The age-specific incidence peaks of all childhood cancers and leukaemias were present in south Asian children aged 5-9 years compared with 0-4 years olds in the non-south Asian population. Non-significant increases of 1.4 and 1.5% in the average annual incidence of all cancers were seen for south Asians and non-south Asians respectively, with a significant rise for non-south Asians with leukaemia of 3.0% (P=0.04). Our timely study shows patterns of occurrence of childhood cancer that differ with respect to ethnic group.

As there are no guidelines regarding the frequency of replacement of toothbrushes used by immunocompromised patients, the brush was swabbed regularly and culture performed to detect microbial colonization. Viridans streptococci were cultured from the toothbrush after 2 weeks of use.

Such cell targeting vectors have been found to directly transduce human cells expressing the cell surface molecules recognized by the respective scFv. In an attempt to achieve targeted gene transfer into epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive human cells, SNV vector particles carrying a surface (SU) envelope protein N-terminally modified with the EGF domain and the wildtype transmembrane protein were generated. However, direct transduction of EGFR-positive cells was not detected. Canine D17 cells, which can be infected by wildtype SNV, were also not transduced. Infectivity of D17 cells was restored by removal of the EGF modification via cleavage of a factor Xa site located between the EGF domain and the SU protein or by blocking the EGFRs on the cell surface by EGF treatment. The properties of SNV-EGF vector particles as described here are similar to those of murine leukemia virus-derived vector particles harboring envelope proteins modified with a growth factor-derived domain. It seems therefore that, although scFv-modified SNV allows direct cell targeting, EGF-modified SNV allows only indirect cell targeting.","['Merten, Christoph A', 'Engelstaedter, Martin', 'Buchholz, Christian J', 'Cichutek, Klaus']","['Merten CA', 'Engelstaedter M', 'Buchholz CJ', 'Cichutek K']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/analysis', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/metabolism']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/01/17 04:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202917782 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1778 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Jan 5;305(1):106-14. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1778.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old white man with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia underwent a matched unrelated donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant with adequate engraftment and mild graft-versus-host disease responding to corticosteroids. Approximately 11 months after transplant, the patient was admitted to the hospital with suspected fungal pneumonia and started on liposomal amphotericin B (baseline serum creatinine 1.4-1.5 mg/dL). The dose was increased due to his immunosuppression and poor response, as the fungal etiology was identified as Torulopsis glabrata. The patient required mechanical ventilation due to biopsy-proven bronchiolitis olbiterans organizing pneumonia. Additionally, he developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and received intravenous desmopressin, with a reduction in bloody secretions. He also developed hypernatremia (serum sodium 155 mEq/L) on day 3 of the desmopressin and had an inappropriately increased urine output consistent with NDI. The most likely etiology for the NDI was liposomal amphotericin B and its associated hypokalemia. DISCUSSION: The observation of worsening hypernatremia (serum sodium increased from 135 to 164 mEq/L) with polyuria was associated with an increasing cumulative dosage of liposomal amphotericin B for fungal pneumonia despite the concurrent use of intravenous desmopressin. Aggressive water replacement was an effective treatment option in this patient. The Naranjo probability scale classified this as a possible adverse reaction because of the temporal sequence of NDI after high-dose liposomal amphotericin B and previously reported cases of NDI associated with amphotericin B desoxycholate. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B desoxycholate has been implicated as an etiology for NDI, and the use of the newer liposomal amphotericin B reportedly avoids this rare complication. We observed the development of NDI despite the use of liposomal amphotericin B in a critically ill patient with bone marrow transplant.","['Canada, Todd W', 'Weavind, Lisa M', 'Augustin, Kristan M']","['Canada TW', 'Weavind LM', 'Augustin KM']","['Division of Pharmacy, Unit 90, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. tcanada@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Candida glabrata', 'Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/drug therapy/microbiology']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.1C204 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2003 Jan;37(1):70-3. doi: 10.1345/aph.1C204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: Ototoxicity with intravenous vancomycin has been documented in multiple case reports, but this adverse effect has not been reported with intrathecal vancomycin. Cerebrospinal fluid vancomycin concentrations were not measured in our patient, but there was 1 documented occurrence of supratherapeutic serum vancomycin concentrations. Other drug-related causes of ototoxicity were evaluated and intrathecal vancomycin-induced ototoxicity was considered to be possible according to the Naranjo probability scale.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with crossovers for some patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pain and distress ratings of patients undergoing BMAs (n = 73) and LPs (n = 105) were examined in a comparison of 3 different interventions: (1) a topical eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA cream), (2) oral midazolam and EMLA cream, or (3) propofol/fentanyl general anesthesia. The choice of the intervention depended on patient/parent request. A validated faces pain scale was completed by the child or parent following each BMA or LP. The faces pain scale includes ratings of the severity of pain (from 0 = none to 5 = severe) and ratings of how frightened (from 0 = not scared to 5 = scared) the child was prior to each procedure. Comparisons of the pain and distress ratings were made among all patients for their first procedure and also within individual patients who had received >1 of the 3 interventions. Independent comparisons between the first treatments received by each patient were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Comparisons of different crossover treatments received by individual patients were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: For all first procedures, mean +/- SD pain and distress ratings during LPs were significantly lower when propofol/fentanyl was used (n = 43; 0.4 +/- 1.0 and 1.4 +/- 1.7) versus either EMLA (n = 29; 2.4 +/- 1.7 and 2.9 +/- 1.9) or midazolam/EMLA (n = 33; 2.4 +/- 1.8 and 2.7 +/- 1.8), respectively.

In most mammalian cells, only short molecules can be used because long ones induce the interferon pathway. With the identification of a proper target sequence, the penetration of the oligonucleotides constitutes the most serious limitation in the application of this technique. Here we show that a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the mRNA of the kinesin Eg5 induces a rapid mitotic arrest and provides a convenient assay for the optimization of siRNA transfection. Thus, dose responses can be established for different transfection techniques, highlighting the great differences in response to transfection techniques of various cell types. We report that the calcium phosphate precipitation technique can be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to Oligofectamine in some adherent cells, while electroporation can be efficient for some cells growing in suspension such as hematopoietic cells and some adherent cells. Significantly, the optimal parameters for the electroporation of siRNA differ from those for plasmids, allowing the use of milder conditions that induce less cell toxicity. In summary, a single siRNA leading to an easily assayed phenotype can be used to monitor the transfection of siRNA into any type of proliferating cells of both human and murine origin.","['Weil, D', 'Garcon, L', 'Harper, M', 'Dumenil, D', 'Dautry, F', 'Kress, M']","['Weil D', 'Garcon L', 'Harper M', 'Dumenil D', 'Dautry F', 'Kress M']","['CNRS UPR1983, Institut Andre Lwoff, 7 rue Guy Moquet, 94801 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,"['0 (Calcium Phosphates)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (KIF11 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (alpha-tricalcium phosphate)', '0 (tetracalcium phosphate)', '701EKV9RMN (calcium phosphate, monobasic, anhydrous)', '97Z1WI3NDX (calcium phosphate)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)', 'L11K75P92J (calcium phosphate, dibasic, anhydrous)']",IM,"['Calcium Phosphates', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Carriers', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Targeting/economics/*methods', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinesins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection/economics/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus Proteins/*genetics']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2144/02336st01 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechniques. 2002 Dec;33(6):1244-8. doi: 10.2144/02336st01.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Saudi perspective.,219-29,"OBJECTIVE: There is a rapidly growing trend in the consumption of herbal remedies in industrialised and developing countries. Users of herbal remedies are at risk of toxicity and adverse interactions of herbal preparations due to their frequent contamination with metals and adulteration with synthetic drugs. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of herbal remedies present on the market in Saudi Arabia in recent years. METHODOLOGY: 247 herbal remedies and related preparations were examined from 2000-2001 at the Toxicology Laboratory, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Herbal powder samples were the most common sample type examined (n = 80), followed by complete, packed preparations (n = 59), single undescribed capsules or pills (n = 46), loose plant leaves or seeds (n = 28), creams (n = 18) and liquid or jelly samples (n = 16). All samples were subjected to toxicological screening for organic substances using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis, screening for heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, and lead) using inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and microbiological examination. RESULTS: The preparations analysed were used to treat the following indications: leukaemia and other forms of cancer (n = 22); obesity (n = 18); diabetes mellitus (n = 14); rheumatic disorders (n = 14); skin pigmentation problems (n = 11); or to enhance male sexual activity (n = 9). In 123 cases, the indication of use was not known. 39 samples contained high concentrations of heavy metals. This was particularly striking in remedies used to treat leukaemia (arsenic content of 522-161,600 ppm) and in creams for whitening skin (mercury content of 5,700-126,000 ppm). Eight preparations contained synthetic drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants in sedative preparations, cyproheptadine in a remedy to gain bodyweight, ibuprofen and dipyrone in herbal capsules used to treat rheumatism). 18 samples were contaminated with micro-organisms. 14 samples contained toxic substances of natural origin. Of the 247 examined preparations, 77 (i.e. over 30%) were disqualified due to high heavy metals content, bacterial contamination or presence of toxic organic substances. CONCLUSION: The study shows an urgent need to control the production, importing and selling of herbal preparations.","['Bogusz, Maciej J', 'al Tufail, Mohammed', 'Hassan, Huda']","['Bogusz MJ', 'al Tufail M', 'Hassan H']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. mbogusz@web.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Adverse Drug React Toxicol Rev,Adverse drug reactions and toxicological reviews,9109474,"['0 (Metals, Heavy)', '0 (Plant Preparations)']",IM,"['Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy', '*Drug Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Metals, Heavy/*analysis', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Obesity/drug therapy', '*Phytotherapy', '*Plant Preparations/adverse effects/analysis/therapeutic use', 'Rheumatic Diseases/drug therapy', 'Saudi Arabia']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03256198 [doi]'],ppublish,Adverse Drug React Toxicol Rev. 2002;21(4):219-29. doi: 10.1007/BF03256198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) is a humanized antiCD33 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a derivative of a cytotoxic antibiotic, calicheamicin. As a single agent, gemtuzumab ozogamicin has activity (complete remission rate of 15-20%) in patients with relapsed disease. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-based combinations are being studied as induction, maintenance and relapse regimens. The chemical hepatotoxicity often observed with gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy is of little clinical consequence. However, hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a relatively frequent and serious toxicity for which no clear risk factors, other than stem cell transplantation, have been defined. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-based regimens may be particularly worthy of study in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is approved as single-agent therapy for patients over the age of 60 years in first relapse who are not considered candidates for cytotoxic therapy. The administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin should be carried out under a level of supervision commensurate with that afforded other intensely myelosuppressive agents. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-based combinations should not be prescribed outside the research setting until further data is available.","['Giles, Francis J']",['Giles FJ'],"['Department of Leukemia, Box 428, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",,2002/12/31 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2002/12/31 04:00'],"['2002/12/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['ERA020604 [pii]', '10.1586/14737140.2.6.630 [doi]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2002 Dec;2(6):630-40. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2.6.630.,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With newer drug protocols the five-year survival rate is now close to 80%. Various factors have been reported to be important for prognosis and should be considered when planning MATERIAL/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, prognostic variables and the five-year survival rate were analyzed. Data regarding demographic characteristics, family and personal history, manifestations at the time of presentation, therapeutic regimens and outcome were collected from the records of 76 ALL patients in treatment five years prior to the study. Two pathologists performed the staging using the morphology method (L1, L2 and L3). RESULTS: Fifty-five subjects (72.5%) survived until the end of the study. One subject succumbed to the rapid fatal course of the disease and 20 others passed away due to relapses or infection during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Among all variables a worse prognosis was associated (p<0.05) with WBC counts greater than 50,000/ml at presentation, relapse in the CNS, and relapse in the bone marrow. When Anthracycline was included in the therapeutic regimen, the effect of chemotherapy was more favorable compared to regimens without Anthracycline (p<0.05). Other variables previously reported to have prognostic value, especially age and sex, were not significant in our study (p>0.05). Other factors which might account for a poorer prognosis included the preponderance of L-2 morphology, difficult access to medical care, decreased compliance of families due to exhausted economic and psychological reserves, and inadequate knowledge about the disease course and treatment.","['Karimi, Mehran', 'Yarmohammadi, Hooman', 'Sabri, Mohammad R']","['Karimi M', 'Yarmohammadi H', 'Sabri MR']","['Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['3265 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2002 Dec;8(12):CR792-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deposition of virus genomes at these nuclear sites occurs due to the binding of the interferon-inducible repressor protein promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and/or Daxx to a viral DNA-protein complex. However, the presence of repressive proteins at the nuclear site of virus transcription has remained unexplained. We investigated the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) immediate-early 1 protein (IE1), which is necessary for productive infection at low multiplicities of infection and therefore likely to be involved in overcoming cellular repression. Temporal analysis of IE1 distribution revealed its initial segregation into ND10 by binding to PML and/or Daxx and IE1-dependent recruitment of the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC-2) to this site. However, these protein aggregates are dissociated in cells producing sufficient IE1 through titration of PML, Daxx, and HDAC-2. Importantly, binding of IE1 to HDAC-2 decreased deacetylation activity. Moreover, inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin-A resulted in an increase in viral protein synthesis, an increase in cells starting the formation of prereplication compartments, and an increase in the total infectious viruses produced. Thus, IE1, like trichostatin-A, reverses the repressive effect of HDAC evident in the presence of acetylated histones in the immediate-early promoter region. Since HDAC also binds to the promoter region of IE1, as determined by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, these combined results suggest that IE1 inhibits or reverses HDAC-mediated repression of the infecting viral genomes, possibly by a process akin to activation of heterochromatin. We propose that even permissive cells can repress transcription of infecting viral genomes through repressors, including HDAC, Daxx, and PML, and the segregation of IE1 to ND10 that would inactivate those repressors. The virus can counter this repression by overexpressing IE1 when present in sufficient copy number, thus reducing the availability and effectiveness of these repressors.","['Tang, Qiyi', 'Maul, Gerd G']","['Tang Q', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Viral Proteins', '*Virus Replication']",PMC140816,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.2.1357-1367.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(2):1357-67. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.2.1357-1367.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other viruses containing heavily glycosylated glycoproteins (GPs) fail to interact with DC-SIGN(R), suggesting some degree of specificity in this interaction. We show here that DC-SIGN(R) selectively interact with HIV Env and Ebola virus GPs containing more high-mannose than complex carbohydrate structures. Modulation of N-glycans on Env or GP through production of viruses in different primary cells or in the presence of the mannosidase I inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin dramatically affected DC-SIGN(R) infectivity enhancement. Further, murine leukemia virus, which typically does not interact efficiently with DC-SIGN(R), could do so when produced in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin. We predict that other viruses containing GPs with a large proportion of high-mannose N-glycans will efficiently interact with DC-SIGN(R), whereas those with solely complex N-glycans will not. Thus, the virus-producing cell type is an important factor in dictating both N-glycan status and virus interactions with DC-SIGN(R), which may impact virus tropism and transmissibility in vivo.","['Lin, George', 'Simmons, Graham', 'Pohlmann, Stefan', 'Baribaud, Frederic', 'Ni, Houping', 'Leslie, George J', 'Haggarty, Beth S', 'Bates, Paul', 'Weissman, Drew', 'Hoxie, James A', 'Doms, Robert W']","['Lin G', 'Simmons G', 'Pohlmann S', 'Baribaud F', 'Ni H', 'Leslie GJ', 'Haggarty BS', 'Bates P', 'Weissman D', 'Hoxie JA', 'Doms RW']","['Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 35383/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 AI43455/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI045378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI043455/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL62060-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI45008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI045008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76256/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076256/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 40880/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 AI45378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CLEC4M protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Ebolavirus/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HIV/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC140807,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.2.1337-1346.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(2):1337-46. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.2.1337-1346.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a significant fraction of virion-associated TM is further processed by the viral protease to remove the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, the R peptide. This cleavage greatly enhances the fusogenicity of the protein and is necessary for the formation of a fully functional Env protein complex. We have previously proposed that R peptide cleavage enhances fusogenicity by altering the conformation of the ectodomain of the protein (Y. Zhao et al., J. Virol. 72:5392-5398, 1998). Using a series of truncation and point mutants of MoMuLV Env, we now provide direct biochemical and immunological evidence that the cytoplasmic tail and the membrane-spanning region of Env can influence the overall structure of the ectodomain of the protein and alter the strength of the SU-TM interaction. The R-peptide-truncated form of the protein, in particular, exhibits a markedly different conformation than the full-length protein.","['Aguilar, Hector C', 'Anderson, W French', 'Cannon, Paula M']","['Aguilar HC', 'Anderson WF', 'Cannon PM']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC140788,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.2.1281-1291.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(2):1281-91. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.2.1281-1291.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While insertions can target the gene directly, numerous clusters of retroviral insertion sites have been identified which map close to c-myb and outside the transcription unit in T-lymphomas (Ahi-1, fit-1, and Mis-2) and monocytic and myeloid leukemias (Mml1, Mml2, Mml3, and Epi-1). Previous analyses showed no consistent effect of these insertions on c-myb expression, raising the possibility that other nearby genes were the true targets. In contrast, our analysis of four cell lines established from lymphomas bearing insertions at fit-1 (fti-1) (feline leukemia virus) and Ahi-1 (Moloney murine leukemia virus) shows that these display higher expression levels of c-myb RNA and protein compared to a panel of phenotypically similar cell lines lacking such insertions. An interesting feature of the cell lines with long-range c-myb insertions was that each also carried an activated Myc allele. The potential for oncogenic synergy between Myb and Myc in T-cell lymphoma was confirmed in transgenic mice overexpressing alleles of both genes in the T-cell compartment, lending further credence to the case for c-myb as the major target for long-range activation. In contrast, mapping and analysis of c-myb neighboring genes (HBS1 and FLJ20069) showed that the expression of these genes did not correlate well with the presence of proviral insertions. A possible explanation for the paradoxical behavior of c-myb was provided by one of the murine T-lymphoma lines bearing an insertion at Ahi-1 (p/m16i) that reproducibly down-regulated c-myb RNA and protein to very low levels or undetectable levels on prolonged culture. Our observations implicate c-myb as a key target of upstream and downstream retroviral insertions. However, overexpression may become dispensable during outgrowth in vitro, and perhaps during tumor progression in vivo, providing a potential rationale for the previously observed discordance between retroviral insertion and c-myb expression levels.","['Hanlon, L', 'Barr, N I', 'Blyth, K', 'Stewart, M', 'Haviernik, P', 'Wolff, L', 'Weston, K', 'Cameron, E R', 'Neil, J C']","['Hanlon L', 'Barr NI', 'Blyth K', 'Stewart M', 'Haviernik P', 'Wolff L', 'Weston K', 'Cameron ER', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, United Kingdom. lh40w@udcf.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genes, myb', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC140821,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.2.1059-1068.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(2):1059-68. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.2.1059-1068.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified murine, hamster, canine, and porcine cell lines that are resistant to HTLV-1 Env-induced syncytium formation. This resistance was not due to the absence of functional receptors for HTLV Env, as these cells were susceptible to infection with HTLV Env-pseudotyped virions. As murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env and HTLV Env present close structural homologies (F. J. Kim, I. Seiliez, C. Denesvre, D. Lavillette, F. L. Cosset, and M. Sitbon, J. Biol. Chem. 275:23417-23420, 2000), and because activation of syncytium formation by MLV Env generally requires cleavage of the R peptide in the cytoplasmic domain of the Env transmembrane (TM) component, we assessed whether truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of HTLV Env would alleviate this resistance. Indeed, in all resistant cell lines, truncation of the last 8 amino acids of the HTLV Env cytoplasmic domain (HdC8) was sufficient to overcome resistance to HTLV Env-induced syncytium formation. Furthermore, HdC8-mediated cell-to-cell infection titers varied according to the target cell lines and could be significantly higher than that observed with HTLV Env on HeLa cells. These data indicate that a determinant located within the 8 carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic amino acids of TM plays a distinct role in HTLV Env-mediated cell-to-cell infection and syncytium formation.","['Kim, Felix J', 'Manel, Nicolas', 'Boublik, Yvan', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Sitbon, Marc']","['Kim FJ', 'Manel N', 'Boublik Y', 'Battini JL', 'Sitbon M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, CNRS-UMR 5535, IFR24, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*virology', 'Gene Products, env/*physiology', 'Giant Cells/*cytology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",PMC140806,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.2.963-969.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(2):963-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.2.963-969.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/X02794'],,,,,

These types of damage can also induce death by apoptosis through activation of a pro-apoptosis pathway. We attempted to detect OH radicals inside human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells and estimate the relationship between radiation-induced apoptosis and OH radicals generated inside the cells. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy showed that OH radicals were generated by X-rays within irradiated cell pellets and the relative signal intensities of OH radicals increased with the radiation dose. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the death of HL60 cells by apoptosis was accompanied by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation at 2 h after irradiation with 10-30 Gy. On ultrastructure evaluation by transmission electron microscopy, certain irradiated HL60 cells demonstrated condensed chromatin forms at the nuclear membrane and nuclear fragmentation. The frequency of apoptotic cells with condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin increased with radiation dose in semithin sections. The increase of quantitative DNA fragmentation and percentage of non-living cells also correlated with radiation dose. These results suggest that OH radicals are generated inside cells before apoptosis occurs. The amount of OH radicals generated correlates with apoptotic cell death.","['Hosokawa, Yoichiro', 'Tanaka, Likinobu', 'Kaneko, Masayuki', 'Sakakura, Yasunori', 'Tsuruga, Eichi', 'Irie, Kazuharu', 'Yajima, Toshihiko']","['Hosokawa Y', 'Tanaka L', 'Kaneko M', 'Sakakura Y', 'Tsuruga E', 'Irie K', 'Yajima T']","['Department of Dental Radiology, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, School of Dentistry, Hokkaido, Japan. hosokawa@hoku-iryo-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Arch Histol Cytol,Archives of histology and cytology,8806082,['3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyl Radical/*radiation effects', 'Microscopy, Electron']",,2002/12/28 04:00,2003/05/24 05:00,['2002/12/28 04:00'],"['2002/12/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1679/aohc.65.301 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Histol Cytol. 2002 Oct;65(4):301-5. doi: 10.1679/aohc.65.301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: This paper reports the results of the epidemiological surveillance of childhood leukaemia in Hungary from 1980 to 2000, according to the database of the Hungarian Paediatric Cancer Registry. METHODS: All childhood leukaemia cases diagnosed between the period of 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2000, age of 0-14, throughout Hungary have been recorded. The registration was done by the ten Paediatric Oncology Centres in Hungary. The total number of diagnosed and analysed cases was 1563. RESULTS: The incidence rate of childhood leukaemia showed a gradual, slow but significant increase of 1.2% per year over the observed period of time. There was neither any additional increase in the incidence following the accident, nor an increase in the cumulative incidence among the children born around the date of the accident. The accident did not cause a change regarding the infant leukaemia incidence in Hungary either. Apparent change in the geographical distribution of childhood leukaemia, which could be the result of the accident, was not detectable. CONCLUSION: The authors did not detect any change in the incidence of childhood leukaemia over the past 21 years in Hungary, which can be attributed to the nuclear power plant accident in Ukraine in 1986.","['Torok, Szabolcs', 'Borgulya, Gabor', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna', 'Schuler, Dezso', 'Fekete, Gyorgy']","['Torok S', 'Borgulya G', 'Jakab Z', 'Schuler D', 'Fekete G']","['Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, II.

The mechanisms by which alcohol affects the function of human immune cells that are the targets for HIV are unknown. METHODS: Human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were incubated with or without alcohol (10-40 mM) for 24 hr and then infected with HIV for 24 hr. Culture supernatants were harvested for HIV reverse transcription assay. HIV entry receptor (CCR5, CD4, and CXCR4) expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry assays. Beta-chemokines were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Different HIV strains (Bal, SF-162, 89.6, and UG024) were used for infection experiments. In addition, ADA (macrophage-tropic strain) and murine leukemia virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was carried out. RESULTS: Although alcohol had little effect on HIV T-lymphocyte-tropic strain infection, it significantly enhanced HIV R5 strain infection in MDM. The enhancing effect of alcohol on the HIV R5 strain was further evidenced by the observation that the R5 (ADA) strain envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection is markedly increased by alcohol, whereas murine leukemia virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was not affected. Alcohol significantly up-regulated CCR5 receptor expression and inhibited the endogenous production of beta-chemokines by MDM. CONCLUSION: Alcohol, through the down-regulation of beta-chemokine production and the up-regulation of CCR5 receptor expression, enhances HIV R5 strain infection of MDM and may have an important role as a cofactor in the progression of HIV disease.","['Wang, Xu', 'Douglas, Steven D', 'Metzger, David S', 'Guo, Chang-Jiang', 'Li, Yuan', ""O'Brien, Charles P"", 'Song, Li', 'Davis-Vogal, Annet', 'Ho, Wen-Zhe']","['Wang X', 'Douglas SD', 'Metzger DS', 'Guo CJ', 'Li Y', ""O'Brien CP"", 'Song L', 'Davis-Vogal A', 'Ho WZ']","[""Division of Immunologic and Infectious Disease, Joseph Stokes Jr Research Institute at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['MH49981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DA12815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA 13547/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA013547/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA012815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH049981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', '*HIV Infections/immunology/metabolism', '*HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",PMC4015111,2002/12/25 04:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2002/12/25 04:00'],"['2002/12/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.ALC.0000042148.50808.04 [doi]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2002 Dec;26(12):1880-6. doi: 10.1097/01.ALC.0000042148.50808.04.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS575085'],,

However, erythropoietic reconstitution after nonmyeloablative SCT (NMSCT) has never been characterized. METHODS: Twelve patients received a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) alone (n=6), 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine (n=3), or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (n=3), followed by transplantation of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells. Graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was carried out with mycophenolate mofetil (from day -1 to day 28) plus cyclosporine (from day -1 to day 120 or longer in case of chronic GvHD). Erythropoiesis was quantitated by soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels, and the adequacy of Epo production was evaluated by the observed-to-predicted Epo ratio (O/P Epo). RESULTS: Mean sTfR levels decreased following the conditioning regimen but remained well within the normal range throughout the posttransplant period. The O/P Epo ratio presented an initial surge quite similar to that observed after conventional conditioning. Thereafter, the O/P Epo ratio normalized rapidly, and Epo levels remained adequate during the whole observation period. CONCLUSION: Contrarily to what is observed after myeloablative transplant, Epo levels remained adequate after NMSCT, resulting in normal erythropoiesis. These results suggest that the administration of erythropoietin therapy (rHuEpo) could be less effective after NMSCT than after conventional allogeneic transplant.","['Baron, F', 'Fillet, G', 'Beguin, Y']","['Baron F', 'Fillet G', 'Beguin Y']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/blood', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*biosynthesis/blood/*deficiency', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/drug therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Receptors, Transferrin/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/12/25 04:00,2003/01/17 04:00,['2002/12/25 04:00'],"['2002/12/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200212270-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2002 Dec 27;74(12):1692-6. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200212270-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to small sample size and the large number of variables (genes), the selection process can be unstable. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene (variable) selection. We employ latent variables to specialize the model to a regression setting and uses a Bayesian mixture prior to perform the variable selection. We control the size of the model by assigning a prior distribution over the dimension (number of significant genes) of the model. The posterior distributions of the parameters are not in explicit form and we need to use a combination of truncated sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based computation techniques to simulate the parameters from the posteriors. The Bayesian model is flexible enough to identify significant genes as well as to perform future predictions. The method is applied to cancer classification via cDNA microarrays where the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with a hereditary disposition to breast cancer, and the method is used to identify a set of significant genes. The method is also applied successfully to the leukemia data.

We evaluate this method by classifying 327 heterogeneous ALL samples.

However, the data might be used to construct a minimal set of marker genes that could then be used clinically by making antibody assays to diagnose a specific type of cancer. Here a replication algorithm is used for this purpose. It evolves an ensemble of predictors, all using different combinations of genes to generate a set of optimal predictors. RESULTS: We apply this method to the leukemia data of the Whitehead/MIT group that attempts to differentially diagnose two kinds of leukemia, and also to data of Khan et al. to distinguish four different kinds of childhood cancers. In the latter case we were able to reduce the number of genes needed from 96 to less than 15, while at the same time being able to classify all of their test data perfectly.

The total number of measurements was 94. In the patients, a decrease in both the peak velocity and the systolic layer thickening was observed, even in the subclinical phase of the normal ejection fraction. For healthy subjects, systolic thickening occurred in the left ventricular (LV) side of the interventricular septum (IVS), and was characterized by a sharp single-peak configuration of the profile.

We concluded that the TSF is a useful measure for diagnosis of the early phase of DoxCM.","['Koiwa, Yoshiro', 'Kanai, Hiroshi', 'Hasegawa, Hideyuki', 'Saitoh, Yoshiko', 'Shirato, Kunio']","['Koiwa Y', 'Kanai H', 'Hasegawa H', 'Saitoh Y', 'Shirato K']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. koiwa@int1.med.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ultrasound Med Biol,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,0410553,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Echocardiography, Doppler/methods', 'Female', 'Heart Septum/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Systole', 'Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects']",,2002/12/25 04:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2002/12/25 04:00'],"['2002/12/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301562902006440 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-5629(02)00644-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrasound Med Biol. 2002 Nov-Dec;28(11-12):1395-403. doi: 10.1016/s0301-5629(02)00644-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At birth, it can be collected, HLA-typed and stored. Cord blood is successfully used since over 10 years as source of transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, in addition to bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Allogeneic transplantations are performed between HLA-identical siblings and from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Most recipients of cord blood are children with Leukemia or genetic disorders, but also increasingly adolescents and adults. Based on the promising results, cord blood banks with kryopreserved, HLA-typed cord blood samples from anonymous donors are set up worldwide, ready to be used as allogeneic stem cell graft. In addition, so-called ""private"" cord blood banks have been set up, providing the possibility to store cord blood at birth from healthy children with no affected family member for a possible autologous stem cell transplantation in the future if the child later develops a disease such as Leukemia. For several reasons, however, this procedure has been scientifically as well as ethically challenged. To date, there is no established indication for an autologous cord blood transplantation. Nevertheless, the plasticity and multipotency of adult stem cells, which has been recently discovered, could lead to a possible autologous use of cord blood stem cells for different indications in the field of regenerative medicine (cell- and organ replacement/regeneration). So far, however, this remains speculatative. Research in the field of stem cell development and differentiation in the next decade will try to find some answers.","['Surbek, D V', 'Holzgreve, W']","['Surbek DV', 'Holzgreve W']","['Universitats-Frauenklinik, Basel. surbek@hotmail.com']",['ger'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

A combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine (ara-C) is the core of most AML induction regimens. We conducted a pilot study of Mylotarg combined with idarubicin and ara-C in patients with refractory or relapsed AML. METHODS: Mylotarg was administered at 6 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 15, idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) daily on days 2 through 4, and ara-C at 1.5 g/m(2) daily on days 2 through 5 (MIA) RESULTS: Of 14 patients were treated, 4 (29%) had primary resistant AML, and 10 (71%) relapsed AML. The median age of the patients was 61 years (range 34-74 years). MIA induced complete remission (CR) in three patients (21%) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) in three patients (21%). The median survival was 8 weeks (range 2-64 weeks), and the median failure-free survival of CR patients was 27 weeks (range 11-64 weeks).

Other grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities included hepatic transaminitis, oral mucositis, and diarrhea. Two patients (14%) developed hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Mylotarg to idarubicin and ara-C is feasible. MIA has significant activity in patients with refractory AML.

A semisynthetic protein-polymer conjugate of IFN-alpha 2b (PEG-IFN2b) increases the serum half-life of IFN-alpha 2b. We conducted a pilot study of Peg-IFN2b in patients with ET. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a history of persistent (greater than 2 months) platelet counts >600 x 10(9)/l, with hyperplasia of bone marrow megakaryocytes in the absence of an alternate identifiable cause of thrombocytosis were eligible. Patients were required to have either thrombohemorrhagic signs and/or symptoms if previously untreated; persistence of thrombohemorrhagic signs and/or symptoms if receiving anagrelide, IFN-alpha, or hydroxyurea; or intolerance to anagrelide, IFN-alpha, or hydroxyurea. The initial PEG-IFN2b dose was from 1.5 to 4.5 micro g/kg per week subcutaneously with subsequent dose adjustments as indicated by response and adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven patients (nine female, median age 54 years, range 26-69 years) were treated. PEG-IFN2b rapidly controlled platelet counts and resolved symptoms in all patients. The median duration of PEG-IFN2b therapy on-study was 9 months (range 4-17 months). No patient had signs or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage while on study. After 2 months of therapy, 10 patients (91%) were in complete remission, and 11 (100%) after 4 months. One patient discontinued therapy at 4 months because of persistent grade 3 fatigue and a second at 5 months because of anxiety and depression.

Each of these alterations reduces endogenous CBF activities. CBFbeta-SMMHC is expressed from the inv(16) chromosome in 8% of AML cases and inhibits endogenous CBF DNA-binding. Inhibition of CBF reduces Retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and slows the G(1) to S cell cycle transition. c-Myc, a protein which stimulates S phase entry, is over-expressed in one-third of AMLs. We have developed Ba/F3 cell lines in which zinc regulates CBFbeta-SMMHC expression and 4-hydroxytamoxifen activates c-Myc-ER. In these lines, c-Myc-ER overcomes inhibition of cell cycle progression mediated by CBFbeta-SMMHC. CBFbeta-SMMHC does not affect endogenous c-Myc RNA levels, indicating that CBF does not regulate the c-Myc gene. Conversely, c-Myc-ER does not alter CBF DNA-binding activity. Thus, c-Myc-ER acts downstream of CBFbeta-SMMHC to stimulate cell cycle progression. In a subset of CBF leukemias, elevated expression of c-Myc is expected to facilitate the proliferation of the leukemic blasts and thereby potentiate the ability of CBF oncoproteins to block differentiation.","['Bernardin, Florence', 'Yang, Yandan', 'Civin, Curt I', 'Friedman, Alan D']","['Bernardin F', 'Yang Y', 'Civin CI', 'Friedman AD']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL 51388/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (inv(16) fusion protein, human)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smooth Muscle Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/agonists', 'S Phase/genetics/physiology', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Zinc/metabolism']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']","['04170279 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.1.5.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Sep-Oct;1(5):492-6. doi: 10.4161/cbt.1.5.163.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mcl-1 induction in THP-1 cells was optimal at a multiplicity of infection of 0.8-1.2 bacilli per macrophage and was independent of opsonin coating of the bacteria. Mcl-1 expression was elevated as early as 4 h, peaked at 5.8-fold above control cells at 24 h, and remained elevated at 48 h after infection. In THP-1 cells, mMcl-1 mRNA was induced by infection with live H37Rv but not with attenuated M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra, heat-killed H37Rv, or latex beads. In THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), Mcl-1 protein was induced by infection with live H37Rv but not with attenuated M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra, heat-killed H37Rv, or latex beads. Treatment of uninfected, H37Ra-infected, and H37Rv-infected THP-1 cells and MDMs with antisense oligonucleotides to mcl-1 reduced Mcl-1 expression by >84%. This resulted in an increase in apoptosis of both MDMs and THP-1 cells that were infected with H37Rv, but not cells that were uninfected or infected with H37Ra. Increased apoptosis correlated with a decrease in M. tuberculosis CFUs recovered from antisense-treated, H37Rv-infected cells at 4 and 7 days after infection. In contrast, CFU recoveries from sense-treated, H37Rv-infected cells or from antisense- or sense-treated, H37Ra-infected cells were unchanged from controls.

Because Vav1 inducibly associates with further proteins including phospholipase C (PLC)gamma1 and Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), we investigated their role for NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat leukemia T cell lines deficient for expression of these two proteins. Cells lacking SLP-76 or PLCgamma1 failed to activate NF-kappaB in response to T cell costimulation. In contrast, replenishment of SLP-76 or PLCgamma1 expression restored CD3/CD28-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity as well as NF-kappaB DNA binding and transactivation. PKCtheta activated NF-kappaB in SLP-76- and PLCgamma1-deficient cells, showing that PKCtheta is acting further downstream. In contrast, Vav1-induced NF-kappaB activation was normal in SLP-76(-) cells, but absent in PLCgamma1(-) cells. CD3/CD28-stimulated recruitment of PKCtheta and IKKgamma to lipid rafts was lost in SLP-76- or PLCgamma1-negative cells, while translocation of Vav1 remained unaffected. Accordingly, recruitment of PKCtheta to the immunological synapse strictly relied on the presence of SLP-76 and PLCgamma1, but synapse translocation of Vav1 identified in this study was independent from both proteins. These results show the importance of SLP-76 and PLCgamma1 for NF-kappaB activation and raft translocation of PKCtheta and IKKgamma.","['Dienz, Oliver', 'Moller, Andreas', 'Strecker, Andreas', 'Stephan, Nadja', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Droge, Wulf', 'Schmitz, M Lienhard']","['Dienz O', 'Moller A', 'Strecker A', 'Stephan N', 'Krammer PH', 'Droge W', 'Schmitz ML']","['Division of Immunochemistry, German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum), Im Neuenheimer Feld, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (SLP-76 signal Transducing adaptor proteins)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'CD28 Antigens/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Membrane Microdomains/*enzymology/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Type C Phospholipases/genetics/*physiology', 'src Homology Domains/genetics/*immunology']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.365 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Jan 1;170(1):365-72. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.365.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the TWEAK receptor(s) that mediates these multiple death pathways remains to be identified. Recently, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) has been identified to be a TWEAK receptor, which was responsible for TWEAK-induced proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis. Because Fn14 lacks the cytoplasmic death domain, it remains unclear whether Fn14 can also mediate the TWEAK-induced cell death. In this study, we demonstrated that TWEAK could induce apoptotic cell death in Fn14 transfectants. A pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, rather sensitized the Fn14 transfectants to TWEAK-induced cell death by necrosis via reactive oxygen intermediates and cathepsin B-dependent pathway. By using newly generated agonistic anti-Fn14 mAbs, we also observed that Fn14 is constitutively expressed on the cell surface of all TWEAK-sensitive tumor cell lines, and can transmit the multiple death signals. Moreover, an anti-Fn14 mAb that blocks TWEAK-Fn14 interaction could totally abrogate TWEAK binding and TWEAK-induced cell death in all TWEAK-sensitive tumor cell lines. These results revealed that the multiple pathways of TWEAK-induced cell death are solely mediated by Fn14.","['Nakayama, Masafumi', 'Ishidoh, Kazumi', 'Kojima, Yuko', 'Harada, Norihiro', 'Kominami, Eiki', 'Okumura, Ko', 'Yagita, Hideo']","['Nakayama M', 'Ishidoh K', 'Kojima Y', 'Harada N', 'Kominami E', 'Okumura K', 'Yagita H']","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokine TWEAK)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF12A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF12 protein, human)', '0 (TWEAK Receptor)', '0 (Tnfrsf12a protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (fibroblast growth factor 14)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/metabolism/toxicity', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Death/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytokine TWEAK', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'HT29 Cells/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'TWEAK Receptor', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.341 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Jan 1;170(1):341-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we extend our previous observation and report that CD24 also mediated apoptosis in human precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines in the pro-B and pre-B stages accompanying activation of multiple caspases. Interestingly, simultaneous cross-linking of pre-BCR clearly inhibited CD24-mediated apoptosis in pre-B cells. We also observed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were involved in the regulation of this apoptotic process. Pre-BCR cross-linking induced prompt and strong activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, whereas CD24 cross-linking induced the sustained activation of p38 MAPK, following weak extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 activation. SC68376, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, inhibited apoptosis induction by CD24 cross-linking, whereas anisomycin, an activator of p38 MAPK, enhanced the apoptosis. In addition, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, enhanced apoptosis induction by CD24 cross-linking and reduced the antiapoptotic effects of pre-BCR cross-linking.

However, the role of gammadelta-T lymphocytes in fibrogenic tissue reactions is not well understood. Therefore, we addressed the question of whether human gammadelta-T cells express and synthesize connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a factor known to regulate fibrogenesis and wound healing. In addition, the lymphoblastic leukemia T cell line (Loucy) that possesses characteristics typical of gammadelta-T cells was used as a model to evaluate the regulation of CTGF gene expression. Blood gammadelta-T cells isolated from healthy donors were grown in the presence of IL-15/TGF-beta1 for 48 h and assessed for the expression and synthesis of CTGF. Nonstimulated human blood gammadelta-T cells and Loucy gammadelta-T cells expressed low levels of CTGF mRNA. Costimulation of the cells with IL-15 and TGF-beta1 resulted in a substantially increased level of CTGF mRNA expression within 4-8 h, and it remained elevated for at least 48 h. In contrast, no CTGF mRNA was detected when nonstimulated and stimulated human CD4+ alphabeta-T cells were analyzed. In addition, Western blot analysis of human gammadelta-T cell lysates prepared 4 days following stimulation with IL-15 and TGF-beta1 revealed a 38-kDa CTGF protein in cell lysates of human gammadelta-T cells. Detection was confirmed using Colo 849 fibroblasts, which can constitutively express high levels of CTGF. In conclusion, we herein present novel evidence that in contrast to CD4+ alphabeta-T cells human gammadelta-T cells are capable of expressing CTGF mRNA and synthesizing its corresponding protein, which supports the concept that gammadelta-T cells may contribute to wound healing or tissue fibrotic processes.","['Workalemahu, Grefachew', 'Foerster, Martin', 'Kroegel, Claus', 'Braun, Ruedi K']","['Workalemahu G', 'Foerster M', 'Kroegel C', 'Braun RK']","['Pneumology and Allergology, University Medical Clinic IV, Jena, Germany. grefachew.workalemahu@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-15/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.153 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Jan 1;170(1):153-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.1.153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CH3 domain of CBP binds numerous transcription factors and several viral oncoproteins. We identified the Src substrate and RNA-binding protein Sam68 as novel CH3-binding protein. Sam68 binds the CH3 domain in part through a conserved FXD/EXXXL motif that is shared among several CH3-binding proteins, including the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A and the tumor suppressor p53. Sam68 and CBP interact in vivo and colocalize in nuclear sub-domains. Sam68 has potent transcriptional repression activity that is independent of its RNA binding activity, which suggests that RNA processing and regulation of gene expression by Sam68 are separable functions. Consistent with this, CBP did not stimulate the ability of Sam68 to promote Rev response element-containing mRNA export. Interestingly, Sam68 can regulate RNA processing in the absence of a Rev response element, suggesting that Sam68 functions through a novel RNA element. Together, these findings reveal a previously unidentified function for Sam68 as a transcriptional repressor and suggest that Sam68 might link cellular signaling pathways with components of the transcriptional machinery.","['Hong, Wei', 'Resnick, Ross J', 'Rakowski, Carrie', 'Shalloway, David', 'Taylor, Steven J', 'Blobel, Gerd A']","['Hong W', 'Resnick RJ', 'Rakowski C', 'Shalloway D', 'Taylor SJ', 'Blobel GA']","[""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],['1R01 DK54937-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KHDRBS1 protein, human)', '0 (Khdrbs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (citrate-binding transport protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2002 Nov;1(1):48-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because leukemias are now also considered to be angiogenesis-dependent malignancies, we asked whether a similar paradigm might exist for the BCR-ABL oncogene and the Bcr-Abl targeting drug, STI-571 (imatinib mesylate), in the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. We found that levels of VEGF expression in BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells were reduced in vitro by treatment with STI-571 in a dose-dependent fashion. Transfection of BCR-ABL into murine myeloid 32D and human megakaryocyte MO7e hematopoietic cells resulted in enhanced VEGF expression, which could be further elevated by the exposure to cytokines such as interleukin 3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We also found that conditioned media taken from 32D-p210-transfected cells could stimulate human umbilical vein endothelial cells by increasing phosphorylation of VEGF-R2/KDR and the downstream serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt, an important regulator of endothelial cell survival. Moreover, amplification of BCR-ABL in STI-571-resistant cells was associated with elevated VEGF expression levels which could be reversed by treatment with higher concentrations of STI-571. Taken together, our results implicate BCR-ABL as a possible regulator of CML angiogenesis and raise the possibility that STI-571 could mediate some of its anti-CML properties in vivo through an angiogenesis-dependent mechanism.","['Ebos, John M L', 'Tran, Jennifer', 'Master, Zubin', 'Dumont, Daniel', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Buchdunger, Elisabeth', 'Kerbel, Robert S']","['Ebos JM', 'Tran J', 'Master Z', 'Dumont D', 'Melo JV', 'Buchdunger E', 'Kerbel RS']","[""Molecular and Cell Biology Research, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4N 3M5.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Densitometry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;1(2):89-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. Ferens and C. J. Hovde, Infect. Immun. 68:4462-4469, 2000). The Stx molecular motifs required for antiviral activity were identified, and a mechanism of Stx action on virally infected cells is suggested. Using inhibition of BLV-dependent spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation as a measure of antiviral activity, we showed that Stx2 had antiviral activity similar to that of Stx1. Enzymatic and antiviral activities of three StxA1 chain mutants deficient in enzymatic activity or aspects of receptor-mediated cytotoxicity were compared. Using protein synthesis inhibition to measure enzymatic activity, the mutant E167D was 300-fold less catalytically active than wild-type StxA1, was minimally active in antiviral assays, and did not inhibit synthesis of viral proteins. Two StxA1 mutants, A231D-G234E and StxA(1)1 (enzymatically active but unable to kill cells via the classical receptor-mediated route), had undiminished antiviral activity. Although binding of radiolabeled StxA1 to bovine blood cells or to free virus was not detected, flow cytometric analysis showed that the number of BLV-expressing cells were specifically reduced in cultures treated with Stx. These unique and rare lymphocytes were highly permeable to 40- and 70-kDa fluorescent dextrans, indicating that direct absorption of toxins by virus-expressing cells is a potential mechanism of target cell intoxication. These results support the hypothesis that Stx-producing Escherichia coli colonization of the gastrointestinal tract may benefit ruminant hosts by the ability of Stxs to exert antiviral activity.","['Basu, Indira', 'Ferens, Witold A', 'Stone, Diana M', 'Hovde, Carolyn J']","['Basu I', 'Ferens WA', 'Stone DM', 'Hovde CJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Biology, and Biochemistry, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83844-3052, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR015587/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HD-0-3309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P20RR15587/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 1)', '0 (Shiga Toxin 2)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology/virology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/virology', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/virology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mutation', 'Shiga Toxin 1/pharmacology', 'Shiga Toxin 2/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology']",PMC143405,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/02/11 04:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/IAI.71.1.327-334.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 2003 Jan;71(1):327-34. doi: 10.1128/IAI.71.1.327-334.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that mutations and gene rearrangements involving this complex are frequently implicated in leukemogenesis. Understanding the molecular events leading to the disruption of CBF has provided important insights into our understanding of the normal regulatory pathways that control hematopoiesis and has begun to reveal how alterations in these pathways induce leukemia. INFORMATION SOURCES: Both authors are involved in the identification and characterization of chromosomal abnormalities associated with hematologic malignancy. This has led to contributions to multicenter clinical and laboratory investigations as well as publications in peer-reviewed journals. All of the references cited in this review are published in journals covered by Medline. State of the Art. The core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of the RUNX1 and CBFb subunits. RUNX1 is the DNA binding element of the complex and its affinity is greatly increased in the presence of CBFb. Knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated that both RUNX1 and CBFb are necessary for definitive hematopoiesis. Furthermore, reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving both partners have been directly implicated in leukemogenesis. Evidence is now emerging that at least some of the resulting fusion proteins, namely ETV6-RUNX1, RUNX1-MTG8 and CBFb-MYH11 dominantly inhibit the function of native CBF by recruiting transcriptional co-repressor complexes. However, knock-in studies have shown that whilst expression of these fusion genes may disrupt normal hematopoiesis, this, by itself, is not sufficient for the subsequent development of leukemia. Mutations of RUNX1 have been identified in familial platelet disorder (FDP), in which there is a congenital predisposition to the development of AML and heterozygous point mutations have been identified in the RUNX1 gene in some leukemias. Moreover, a small number of cases have been reported in which amplification of RUNX1 has been detected in childhood ALL suggesting mechanisms other than loss of function, such as gene dosage may also play a role. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the role CBF plays in normal hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies has provided critical reagents for the accurate identification of the broad group of leukemias harboring alterations of CBF. The application of these molecular approaches has already shown an impact on the clinical management of these patients and as more information becomes available, the ability to tailor therapy to improve each patient's chance of a cure becomes feasible.","['Hart, Stephen M', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Hart SM', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, London, UK. s.hart@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Dec;87(12):1307-23.,,,184,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A statement from the Italian Society of Hematology.,1286-306,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Novel therapeutic agents and strategies have been introduced into the management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the last years. This has led to more treatment options and a better chance of long-term survival for MDS patients, but also to uncertainty regarding the optimal use and possible side effects of these treatments. The Italian Society of Hematology commissioned a project to develop guidelines for the therapy of MDS using evidence-based knowledge and consensus-formation techniques. DESIGN AND METHODS: An Advisory Council (AC) shaped the project around a series of key clinical questions, performed a systematic search for evidence and graded the available evidence according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). A list of clinical questions was mailed to each of 10 senior hematologists composing the Expert Panel (EP): the panelists were asked to rank the most relevant questions, and to formulate answers to the questions according to the tables of evidence. A scenario phase followed, so as to reach a consensus on the three top ranked questions. The EP was asked to score patient profiles as appropriate or not appropriate for the therapeutic strategy under scrutiny, according to the RAND technique. Finally, from September 2001 to January 2002, four Consensus Conferences conducted according to the Nominal Group Technique were held in Milan, Italy. The overall goal of the conferences was to take a final decision upon the appropriateness of the uncertain scenarios and of the uncertain responses to the clinical questions. RESULTS: Evidence was judged sufficient for providing recommendations on the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, leukemia-like chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, low-dose chemotherapy, danazol, immunosuppressive therapy, hypomethylating agents and hematopoietic growth factors. Specific recommendations for supportive therapy, including iron chelation, were issued. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was unanimously considered as the only curative treatment for MDS patients, and recommendations on its use were agreed based on patient's age, risk, clinical features and donor availability. AML-like chemotherapy was also considered a valuable therapeutic option for subsets of MDS patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation was recommended for patients who lack an HLA identical donor and have achieved complete remission with AML-like chemotherapy. Decitabine, recombinant human erythropoietin and immunosuppressive therapy were judged valuable therapeutic options for subsets of MDS patients whereas low-dose cytarabine was not. Specific therapeutic strategies for those subjects younger than 18 years or older than 75 years and the strategy of watchful waiting were decided by patient-oriented questions. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Using evidence and consensus, recommendations for the treatment of MDS were issued. Statements were graded according to the strength of the supporting evidence and uncertainty was explicitly declared.","['Alessandrino, Emilio Paolo', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Barosi, Giovanni', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Grossi, Alberto', 'Liberato, Lucio N', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Rebulla, Paolo', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Tura, Sante']","['Alessandrino EP', 'Amadori S', 'Barosi G', 'Cazzola M', 'Grossi A', 'Liberato LN', 'Locatelli F', 'Marchetti M', 'Morra E', 'Rebulla P', 'Visani G', 'Tura S']","['Divisione di Ematologia, IRCCS Policlinico S.

Interestingly, spontaneous B1647 cell proliferation is significantly potentiated by thrombopoietin (TPO). DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to evaluate the proliferative signal transduction events following the activation of c-mpl and we stimulated B1647 cells with TPO 40 ng/mL for 3, 7, 15 and 30 minutes; cells were then lysed and whole lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. RESULTS: In our hands, TPO stimulation induced phosphorylation of several substrate proteins in B1647 cells. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation from background spontaneous activation was transient, maximal after 10 minutes and declined to reach constitutive levels after 30 minutes. In particular, protein substrates between 50 and 140 kDa appeared to be selectively phosphorylated by TPO. We demonstrated that Jak2, Stat3 and Shc were activated in B1647 cells after TPO, as already shown for different cell lines by other authors. Moreover, Lyn kinase activation was detected.

There is thus a need for a suitable agent for solubilization of natural substances to allow testing on a variety of cell lines in-vitro. Such an agent should ideally have no direct effects on any of the commonly used cell lines from a variety of tissues and mammalian species to allow proper comparison. In this study, the lichen metabolite (+)-usnic acid, a dibenzofuran derivative, was used as a prototype for an insoluble natural product with the aim of finding a solvent that was both capable of solubilizing usnic acid and was free of direct activity against a test cell line. Solubilization was measured at different pH values in various concentrations of co-solvents (glycofurol 75, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 400), surfactants (polysorbate 20 and Cremophor RH40), and the complexing agent 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The solubility achieved in a 20% aqueous solution was 0.11 mg mL(-1) for propylene glycol, 0.19 for PEG 400, 0.27 for glycofurol 75, 0.57 for Cremophor RH40, 0.68 for 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and 0.84 for polysorbate 20. The direct effects of the various solvent systems were tested on the human leukaemia cell line K-562 in a standard proliferation assay. Most of the solvents proved toxic with the exception of propylene glycol, PEG 400 and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Anti-proliferative activity of usnic acid could be demonstrated with an ED50 (amount of substance required to reduce thymidine uptake to 50% of uptake by untreated control culture) of 4.7 microg mL(-1) using PEG 400 and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin but only the latter gave satisfactory solubility. 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was thus identified as a solubilizing agent that fulfilled both set criteria of solubility and lack of toxicity against the test cells.","['Kristmundsdottir, Thordis', 'Aradottir, Halldora Aesa', 'Ingolfsdottir, Kristin', 'Ogmundsdottir, Helga M']","['Kristmundsdottir T', 'Aradottir HA', 'Ingolfsdottir K', 'Ogmundsdottir HM']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland. thordisk@hi.is']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Solvents)', '0W584PFJ77 (usnic acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Benzofurans/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Lichens/*chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Solvents', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/05/24 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1211/002235702225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;54(11):1447-52. doi: 10.1211/002235702225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that the combination of ara-C with DNA damaging agents that initiate DNA repair will expand ara-C cytotoxicity to non-cycling cells. The repair kinetics, which included incision of damaged DNA, gap-filling by DNA synthesis and rejoining by ligation, were evaluated using the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay and the thymidine incorporation assay. When normal lymphocytes were treated with ultraviolet C or with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), the processes of DNA excision repair were promptly initiated and rapidly completed. When the cells were incubated with ara-C prior to irradiation or BCNU treatment, the steps of DNA synthesis and rejoining in the repair processes were both inhibited. The ara-C-mediated inhibition of the repair processes was concentration-dependent, with the effect peaking at 10 microM. The combination of ara-C with these DNA repair initiators exerted subsequent cytotoxicity, which was proportional to the extent of the repair inhibition in the presence of ara-C. In conclusion, ara-C was cytotoxic in quiescent cells undergoing DNA repair. This might be attributed to unrepaired DNA damage that remained in the cells, thereby inducing lethal cytotoxicity. Alternatively, ara-C might exert its own cytotoxicity by inhibiting DNA synthesis in the repair processes. Such a strategy may be effective against a dormant subpopulation in acute leukemia that survives chemotherapy.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Kawai Y', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",PMC5926937,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/08/22 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01242.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;93(12):1334-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01242.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and suggest that costunolide induces apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells by depleting the intracellular thiols. Costunolide treatment rapidly depleted the intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols, and this preceded the occurrence of apoptosis. Pretreatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as GSH, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol almost completely blocked the costunolide-induced apoptosis, highlighting the significance of the intracellular thiol level in the process. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 also significantly attenuated the effects of costunolide. The apoptosis-inducing activity of costunolide is likely to depend on the exomethylene moiety because derivatives in which this group was reduced, such as dihydrocostunolide and saussurea lactone, did not deplete the cellular thiols and showed no apoptotic activity. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the costunolide-induced apoptosis depends on intracellular thiols contents, which are modulated by Bcl-2.","['Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Park, Jae-Hoon', 'Lee, Jae Yeol', 'Lee, Yong Sup', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Choi, Jong-Won', 'Masuda, Yutaka', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Choi JH', 'Ha J', 'Park JH', 'Lee JY', 'Lee YS', 'Park HJ', 'Choi JW', 'Masuda Y', 'Nakaya K', 'Lee KT']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Hoegi-Dong, Dongdaemun-Ku, Seoul 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '4IK578SA7Z (costunolide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/physiology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*analysis', 'U937 Cells']",PMC5926928,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/08/22 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01241.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;93(12):1327-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01241.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A primer set that produces a large amplicon (approximately 2,125) was used to detect ALV-J proviral DNA. This primer set was used in lieu of previously published primers because it allows for sequencing of the entire envelope gene and because it was able to detect diagnostically a number of North American ALV-J isolates that could not be detected with previously published primers and PCR conditions. ALV-J proviral DNA was detected in feather pulp at 7 days of age in more than 90% of birds infected as embryos and 7 days postinoculation in over 50% of chickens infected at 3 days of age. The results obtained with PCR on feather pulp were compared with those of virus isolation. In the embryo-inoculated birds, the percentages of agreement between PCR and virus isolation were 92.5% at 7 days of age and 100% at 28, 42, 49, and 56 days of age. However, the overall sensitivity of virus isolation in embryo-infected birds was higher, particularly at 7 and 56 days of age. In chickens inoculated at 3 days of age, the percentages of agreement of detection between PCR and virus isolation ranged from 75% at 10 days of age to 100% at 42 days of age. Agreement of negative results of ALV-J detection by PCR and virus isolation in chickens infected posthatch ranged between 66.6% and 100% between the ages of 10 and 42 days. Virus isolation requires chicken embryo fibroblasts of specific genetic lines, and the process takes onaverage 7-9 days. Aseptic collection of blood and tissues for virus isolation and molecular detection of ALV-J requires sterile necropsy instruments as well as syringes and needles for each individual chicken, whereas sterile microcentrifuge tubes and gloves are the only equipment necessary for aseptic feather pulp collection for ALV-J detection by PCR.

Earlier we have shown that interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated MNC from cord blood have significant cytotoxic activity against human leukemia and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, compared to MNC from peripheral blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to further improve the antitumor cytotoxic ability of cord blood MNC, IL-2 was combined with IL-15 and colony stimulating factors GMCSF, G-CSF and M-CSF for the activation. The activated cells were examined for their cytotoxic effects in vitro against human breast cancer cell lines MDA-231, MDA453 and SKB43 and in vivo against MDA-231 grown in SCID mice. Phenotypes of these activated cells were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of immune response related genes in activated cells was measured using RT-PCR techniques. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in cytotoxicity of the effector cells activated with IL-2, IL-15 and some colony stimulating factors compared to cells activated with each of these cytokines alone or other combinations. Our results demonstrated the increase in cytotoxicity appears to be due to: 1) increase in CD56-positive cytotoxic cells; 2) cytokine/cytotoxic factors produced by the effector cells, such as Interferon-7 and Perforin; 3) stimulation by accessory cells, such as dendritic cells. In vivo administration of in vitro-activated cord blood cells into SCID mice bearing MDA-231 tumors reduced the number of metastases and increased survival compared to untreated tumor bearing controls. CONCLUSION: The combination of IL-2 with IL-15 and CSF is better for the activation of cord blood effector cells than to IL-2 alone.","['Lovgren, Todd R', 'Tarantolo, Stefano R', 'Evans, Cody', 'Kuszynski, Charles A', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Lovgren TR', 'Tarantolo SR', 'Evans C', 'Kuszynski CA', 'Joshi SS']","['Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198-6395, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/24 04:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2002/12/24 04:00'],"['2002/12/24 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/24 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2002 Nov-Dec;16(6):541-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These signals are transmitted, via transmembrane receptors and cascade proteins of the intracellular message system, inside the cell and often to the nucleus, regulating almost every physiological function of the cell. Protein tyrosine kinases constitute a family of receptors that regulate major cellular events, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and apoptosis. Mutant tyrosine kinases and/or their aberrant activity are associated with human cancer and other hyper-proliferative diseases. Strategies for inhibition of aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, such as antisense oligonucleotides, antigenic stimulation and small molecular inhibitors have been developed. STI571, a phenylaminopyrimidine derivative, is considered to be the pioneer of the small molecular inhibitors available to date. It is a successful tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is currently approved and used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. In this article we review the mechanisms of cell signaling, the signal transduction pathways related to tyrosine kinases, their relationship with cancer, and the strategies developed to inhibit the aberrant tyrosine kinase receptor-based signal transduction.

Since there are very few data on ras genes' expression in the early stages of leukemogenesis, in our investigations LE rats were treated with DMBA and the expression of ras genes was measured within two days. DMBA was administered to outbred Long-Evans rats and the fluorescence intensity of the antibody recognizing the ras gene family was measured in femoral bone marrow cells 24 and 48 hours after the treatment. One of the bone marrow cell populations, separated by FSC and SSC, showed elevated ras gene expression at both 24 and 48 hours after the administration of the carcinogen.

This has lead to astonishing advances in the ability to prevent and treat disease and, in the developed world at least, people live longer and healthier lives than ever before. Paradoxically, this has gone hand in hand with the growth of a vocal and influential anti-science lobby that not only rejects much modern science but is also deeply suspicious of new medical interventions. The prospect of cell therapy in the near or middle future is their current target especially where the use of embryonic stem cells or of cell nuclear transfer techniques is concerned. The prospect of cell therapy is welcomed with enthusiasm by patients with genetic and degenerative diseases who hope to benefit from them. On the other hand the whole idea is regarded as repugnant by the anti-science lobby. While some of this opposition is essentially luddite in nature, there are some more persuasive arguments raised particularly to any research than uses embryonic or foetal materials. These arguments will be examined critically. The moral problems of denying the sick the hope of effective treatments have to be weighed against those seen in the development of such treatments.

These include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors edatrexate, methotrexate and aminopterin, the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors ZD1694 and GW1843, the glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARTF) inhibitor DDATHF as well as the multitargeted antifolate LY231514 inhibiting both TS, DHFR and GARTF. Fourteen antifolate-resistant sublines were isolated, 11 of which displayed a drug resistance phenotype that was based on impaired folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity as these cell lines: 1) typically lost 90-99% of parental FPGS activity; 2) expressed 1.4-3.3-fold less FPGS mRNA (only 4 cell lines); 3) displayed up to 10(5)-fold resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates including ZD1694 and MTA; 4) retained sensitivity to polyglutamylation-independent antifolates including ZD9331 and PT523; 5) were up to 19-fold hypersensitive to the lipid-soluble antifolates trimetrexate and AG377; 6) had a normal or a small decrease in [(3)H]MTX transport; and 7) had a 2.1-8.3-fold decreased cellular folate pools and a consequently increased folate growth requirement. The remaining 3 antifolate-resistant sublines lost 94-97% of parental [(3)H]MTX transport and thus displayed a high level resistance to all hydrophilic antifolates. To screen for mutations in the hFPGS gene, we devised an RT-PCR single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) assay. RT-PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing showed that only a single FPGS-deficient subline harbored an FPGS mutation (Cys346Phe). Three-dimensional modeling of the human FPGS based on the crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei FPGS suggested that this mutation maps to the active site and interferes with the catalytic activity of the enzyme due to a putative bulky clash between the mutant Phe346 and a native Phe350 within alpha-helix A10 in a highly conserved C-terminal hydrophobic core. This was consistent with a 23-fold decreased affinity of the mutant Cys346Phe FPGS for L-glutamate. We conclude that decreased FPGS activity is a dominant mechanism of resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent novel antifolates upon a high-dose intermittent exposure schedule. The finding that cells may exhibit 5 orders of magnitude of resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates but in the same time retain parental sensitivity or hypersensitivity to polyglutamylation-independent antifolates or lipophilic antifolates offers a potentially promising treatment strategy in the overcoming of FPGS-based anticancer drug resistance.","['Liani, Esti', 'Rothem, Lilah', 'Bunni, Marlene A', 'Smith, Clyde A', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Liani E', 'Rothem L', 'Bunni MA', 'Smith CA', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, the Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Conformation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10829 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Feb 20;103(5):587-99. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10829.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated amounts of soluble CD105 (sCD105) have been recently identified in selected solid tumors but no data are available on sCD105 in hematopoietic malignancies. Therefore, levels of sCD105 were investigated in sera of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 10) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD) (n = 28), and correlated with those of soluble TGF-beta(1) (sTGF-beta(1)). Dot blot assay detected higher amounts of sCD105 (P < 0.05) both in AML (4.34 +/- 2.62 OD/mm(2)) and in CMD (3.71 +/- 2.09 OD/mm(2)) patients than in healthy subjects (n = 14, 2.38 +/- 1.18 OD/mm(2)).

In essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients with thrombotic episodes, levels of sCD105 were lower (P < 0.05) compared to patients without thrombotic complications, and inversely correlated with those of sTGF-beta(1) (r = 0.94). Conversely, amounts of sCD105 directly correlated with levels of sTGF-beta(1) (r = 0.74) in ET patients without thrombotic events. Our results show that high levels of sCD105 are present in myeloid malignancies that are characterized by a high cellular proliferation rate, and suggest that an altered balance between sCD105 and sTGF-beta(1) might favor disease progression and clinical complications.","['Calabro, Luana', 'Fonsatti, Ester', 'Bellomo, Giacomo', 'Alonci, Andrea', 'Colizzi, Francesca', 'Sigalotti, Luca', 'Altomonte, Maresa', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Maio, Michele']","['Calabro L', 'Fonsatti E', 'Bellomo G', 'Alonci A', 'Colizzi F', 'Sigalotti L', 'Altomonte M', 'Musolino C', 'Maio M']","['Cancer Bioimmunotherapy Unit, Department of Medical Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', 'Chronic Disease', 'Endoglin', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Solubility', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10200 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2003 Feb;194(2):171-5. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10200.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II resulted in rapid and sustained phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727; in contrast, STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation was decreased, with dephosphorylation being most pronounced at 30 minutes. Angiotensin II-induced STAT3 Tyr705 dephosphorylation was not prevented by inhibiting protein synthesis, but was blocked by vanadate or the MEK inhibitor PD98059. PD98059 was found to inhibit angiotensin II-induced Erk activation and STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. Angiotensin II also attenuated LIF-induced STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation, and this effect could be blocked with PD89059. These results are consistent with Erk-mediated STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation leading to STAT3 Tyr705 dephosphorylation, and accounting for angiotensin II-mediated STAT3 inhibition in cardiomyocytes.

We have implemented a strategy for the comprehensive profiling and identification of surface membrane proteins. This strategy has been applied to cancer cells, including the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma, the LoVo colon adenocarcinoma, and the Sup-B15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B cell) cell lines and ovarian tumor cells. Surface membrane proteins of viable, intact cells were subjected to biotinylation then affinity-captured and purified on monomeric avidin columns. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the monomeric avidin columns as intact proteins and were subsequently separated by two-dimensional PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by hybridization with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Highly reproducible, but distinct, two-dimensional patterns consisting of several hundred biotinylated proteins were obtained for the different cell populations analyzed. Identification of a subset of biotinylated proteins among the different cell populations analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and tandem mass spectrometry uncovered proteins with a restricted expression pattern in some cell line(s), such as CD87 and the activin receptor type IIB. We also identified more widely expressed proteins, such as CD98, and a sushi repeat-containing protein, a member of the selectin family. Remarkably, a set of proteins identified as chaperone proteins were found to be highly abundant on the cell surface, including GRP78, GRP75, HSP70, HSP60, HSP54, HSP27, and protein disulfide isomerase.

Therefore, any improvement in the quality of blastocysts produced in vitro is likely to derive from the modification of the postfertilization culture conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the presence or absence of serum and the concentration of BSA during the period of embryo culture in vitro on 1) cleavage rate, 2) the kinetics of embryo development, 3) blastocyst yield, and 4) blastocyst quality, as assessed by cryotolerance and gene expression patterns. The quantification of all gene transcripts was carried out by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Bovine blastocysts from four sources were used: 1) in vitro culture in synthetic oviduct fluid (SOF) supplemented with 3 mg/ml BSA and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2) in vitro culture in SOF + 3 mg/ml BSA in the absence of serum, 3) in vitro culture in SOF + 16 mg/ml BSA in the absence of serum, and 4) in vivo blastocysts. There was no difference in overall blastocyst yield at Day 9 between the groups. However, significantly more blastocysts were present by Day 6 in the presence of 10% serum (20.0%) compared with 3 mg/ml BSA (4.6%, P < 0.001) or 16 mg/ml BSA (11.6%, P < 0.01). By Day 7, however, this difference had disappeared. Following vitrification, there was no difference in survival between blastocysts produced in the presence of 16 mg/ml BSA or those produced in the presence of 10% FCS; the survival of both groups was significantly lower than the in vivo controls at all time points and in terms of hatching rate. In contrast, survival of blastocysts produced in SOF + 3 mg/ml BSA in the absence of serum was intermediate, with no difference remaining at 72 h when compared with in vivo embryos. Differences in relative mRNA abundance among the two groups of blastocysts analyzed were found for genes related to apoptosis (Bax), oxidative stress (MnSOD, CuZnSOD, and SOX), communication through gap junctions (Cx31 and Cx43), maternal recognition of pregnancy (IFN-tau), and differentiation and implantation (LIF and LR-beta). The presence of serum during the culture period resulted in a significant increase in the level of expression of MnSOD, SOX, Bax, LIF, and LR-beta. The level of expression of Cx31 and Cu/ZnSOD also tended to be increased, although the difference was not significant. In contrast, the level of expression of Cx43 and IFN-tau was decreased in the presence of serum. In conclusion, using a combination of measures of developmental competence (cleavage and blastocyst rates) and qualitative measures such as cryotolerance and relative mRNA abundance to give a more complete picture of the consequences of modifying medium composition on the embryo, we have shown that conditions of postfertilization culture, in particular, the presence of serum in the medium, can affect the speed of embryo development and the quality of the resulting blastocysts. The reduced cryotolerance of blastocysts generated in the presence of serum is accompanied by deviations in the relative abundance of developmentally important gene transcripts. Omission of serum during the postfertilization culture period can significantly improve the cryotolerance of the blastocysts to a level intermediate between serum-generated blastocysts and those derived in vivo. The challenge now is to try and bridge this gap.","['Rizos, D', 'Gutierrez-Adan, A', 'Perez-Garnelo, S', 'De La Fuente, J', 'Boland, M P', 'Lonergan, P']","['Rizos D', 'Gutierrez-Adan A', 'Perez-Garnelo S', 'De La Fuente J', 'Boland MP', 'Lonergan P']","['Department of Animal Science and Production, University College Dublin, Lyons Research Farm, Newcastle, County Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (Connexins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (interferon tau)', '136362-16-8 (GJB3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blastocyst/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Count', 'Connexin 43/genetics', 'Connexins/genetics', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Interferon Type I/genetics', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics', '*Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod.102.007799 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2003 Jan;68(1):236-43. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.102.007799.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because FLRG protein binds to activins and bone morphogenetic proteins, FLRG is postulated to be a regulator of these growth factors. However, physiological aspects of FLRG are unclear. To elucidate the physiology of FLRG, we examined expression of FLRG in reproductive tissues of the rat. FLRG mRNA was abundantly expressed in the placenta. FLRG mRNA was also expressed in the ovary, uterus, testis, lung, adrenal gland, pituitary, kidney, small intestine, and heart. During the second half of pregnancy, expression of FLRG in the placenta continuously increased, whereas follistatin mRNA levels decreased from Day 12 to Day 14 and remained low thereafter. FLRG was also expressed in decidua. Levels of decidual FLRG mRNA remained low from Day 12 to Day 16 and then noticeably increased until Day 20. In contrast, follistatin mRNA was highly expressed in the decidua on Day 12, continuously decreased until Day 16, and then remained at relatively low levels thereafter. During the rat estrous cycle, levels of ovarian FLRG mRNA fluctuated diurnally, with highest levels during daytime, and did not change relative to the day of the estrous cycle. The present results suggest that FLRG may play a role in the regulation of reproductive events.","['Arai, Koji Y', 'Tsuchida, Kunihiro', 'Uehara, Kohkichi', 'Taya, Kazuyoshi', 'Sugino, Hiromu']","['Arai KY', 'Tsuchida K', 'Uehara K', 'Taya K', 'Sugino H']","['Department of Tissue Physiology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan. kojiarai@cc.tuat.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Follistatin)', '0 (Follistatin-Related Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '158709-62-7 (Fstl1 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Decidua/*metabolism', 'Estrus/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follistatin/genetics', 'Follistatin-Related Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod.102.008565 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2003 Jan;68(1):199-206. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.102.008565.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the clinical effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the P2X7 receptor gene (1513A-->C) and correlate findings with the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (V(H)) gene mutation status, a prognostic marker in CLL. METHODS: We investigated tumour DNA in 170 patients with CLL using PCR-RFLP analysis with HhaI restriction enzyme cleavage to screen for the polymorphism in the P2X7 receptor gene. The VH gene mutation status was assessed in 165 patients by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. We correlated the findings of the P2X7 receptor genotype with the V(H) gene mutation data and overall survival and screened for the P2X7 receptor polymorphism in 200 healthy controls. FINDINGS: Of the 170 patients, 35 (21%) were heterozygous and one (1%) homozygous for the 1513C allele; whereas 134 (79%) had the 1513A/A genotype of the P2X7 receptor gene. Overall survival was significantly longer for patients with CLL heterozygous for the 1513C allele than those with the 1513A/A genotype. Median survival for heterozygous patients was 104 months (range 33-467) and 72 months (1-190) for homozygous patients (p=0.009). Of the 165 patients with CLL in whom we assessed the V(H) gene mutation status, the V(H) genes were mutated in 71 (43%) patients and unmutated in 94; 18 (25%) of the 71 patients with mutated genes had 1513C allele compared with 17 (18%) of 94 who had unmutated genes. In patients with mutated VH genes, those with CLL who were 1513C positive had 53 months' longer median survival than did those with the 1513A/A genotype (151 vs 98 months, p=0.011). INTERPRETATION: The P2X7 polymorphism could affect clinical outcome in CLL, especially in patients with mutated V(H) genes. Studies are necessary to elucidate the biological role of the P2X7 polymorphism in CLL in vivo.","['Thunberg, Ulf', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Johnson, Anna', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Padyukov, Leonid', 'Hultdin, Magnus', 'Klareskog, Lars', 'Enblad, Gunilla', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Roos, Goran', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Thunberg U', 'Tobin G', 'Johnson A', 'Soderberg O', 'Padyukov L', 'Hultdin M', 'Klareskog L', 'Enblad G', 'Sundstrom C', 'Roos G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(02)11917-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11917-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2002 Dec 14;360(9349):1935-9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11917-9.,,,,,"['Lancet. 2002 Dec 14;360(9349):1898-9.

Based on recently reported 3-year data from the Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 001, disease-free survival was significantly higher in patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with TAC rather than the established regimen of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC). TAC reduced the risk of disease recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive and -negative patients. Whereas overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups, TAC led to a significant reduction in mortality in the subset of patients with one to three involved axillary lymph nodes. Overall, these interim BCIRG 001 results, coupled with those from Cancer and Leukemia Group B-9344 and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-28 (phase III trials of sequential adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel), suggest that taxanes are a valuable component of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with node-positive breast cancer, including those with estrogen receptor positivity and/or extensive lymph node involvement. Accumulating data in the neoadjuvant setting lend further support to the view that the taxanes confer clinically meaningful benefits in the management of early-stage breast cancer.

In these two parameters as well as in the total nucleolus organizer region area per nucleus, however, significant differences could be detected between these four as well as typical chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. Statistical analysis of the morphometric data obtained from all six Ph+ and bcr+ essential thrombocythaemia patients combined indicated a shift of the bone marrow morphology towards the chronic myeloid leukaemia type of myeloproliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These investigations indicate that bcr+ essential thrombocythaemia is infrequent among essential thrombocythaemia patients, and this condition resembles essential thrombocythaemia more than chronic myeloid leukaemia. Various expansions of the Ph+ clone appear to lead to either essential thrombocythaemia or, rather, chronic myeloid leukaemia type of myeloproliferation; however, data in the present study do not indicate that bcr+ essential thrombocythaemia would be a form fruste variant of chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Pajor, L', 'Kereskai, L', 'Zsdral, K', 'Nagy, Z', 'Vass, J A', 'Jakso, P', 'Radvanyi, G']","['Pajor L', 'Kereskai L', 'Zsdral K', 'Nagy Z', 'Vass JA', 'Jakso P', 'Radvanyi G']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Pecs, Pecs, and 3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis Hospital, Miskolc, Hungary. pajor@pathology.pote.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', 'Thrombocytosis/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['1516 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2003.01516.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2003 Jan;42(1):53-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2003.01516.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three adults were entered onto this study. The 2-year probabilities of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) were 39.4 +/- 11.6% and 43.5 +/- 10.3% respectively. The presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was found to be an independent predictive factor affecting lower relapse and DFS. To monitor the BCR-ABL transcript, we also analysed 48 bone marrow samples of eight patients using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The kinetics of the BCR-ABL transcript correlated well with the patients' clinical course. In six patients who were in continuous remission after BMT, a rapid decrease in BCR-ABL copy number to the PCR-negative status was observed after the development of chronic GVHD. Meanwhile, routine bone marrow examination of two patients showed PCR positivity with a 3 or 4-log increase of BCR-ABL copy number and subsequent haematological relapse, which occurred 2 and 4 months later respectively. Although our data should be interpreted cautiously, the presence of chronic GVHD may reduce the risk of relapse in Ph+ ALL. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR appears to be a useful test for BCR-ABL transcript monitoring.","['Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Yoo-Li', 'Hwang, Ji-Yeon', 'Park, Yoon-Hee', 'Shin, Ho-Jin', 'Park, Chi-Young', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Hack-Ki', 'Kim, Chun-Choo']","['Lee S', 'Kim DW', 'Cho B', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim YL', 'Hwang JY', 'Park YH', 'Shin HJ', 'Park CY', 'Min WS', 'Kim HK', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, abl', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/02/06 04:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['3988 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.03988.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jan;120(1):145-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.03988.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we showed that T-LGL leukaemia cells also expressed this B220 isoform.

This study, therefore, investigated individual GSTM isoform expression in ALL blasts at the mRNA level. Leukaemic blasts from 21 children with ALL were studied. Interindividual variation in the pattern of GSTM mRNA isoform expression was demonstrated. GSTM2 transcript was expressed in all patients in contradistinction to GSTM5, which was not detected in any sample. GSTM3 and GSTM4 expression varied between individuals, with GSTM3 expressed in 62% and GSTM4 in 24% of patients. Lymphoblast expression of GSTM3 was positively related to good prognosis whereas expression of GSTM4 was not related to clinical outcome in this small cohort. No relationship was demonstrated with established indicators of prognosis, including sex, age, immunophenotype and presenting white cell count. The results suggest that expression of GSTM3 may play a role in determining prognosis in childhood ALL and could provide more information for accurate stratification of treatment. Further studies are required to determine whether there is a causal relationship between GSTM3 expression and clinical outcome.","['Kearns, Pamela R', 'Chrzanowska-Lightowlers, Zofia M A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Veerman, Anjo', 'Hall, Andrew G']","['Kearns PR', 'Chrzanowska-Lightowlers ZM', 'Pieters R', 'Veerman A', 'Hall AG']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, University of Bristol, UK.

This study aimed to investigate the frequency, phenotype and function of blood-derived leukaemic DC in comparison with DC from healthy donors using flow cytometric assays and mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR). Immature leukaemic DC displayed a reduced endocytotic capacity as compared with healthy controls. Moreover, in vitro maturation of leukaemic DC was found to be deficient. Expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens were reduced on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-matured leukaemic DC but were enhanced by a mixture of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upon stimulation with bacterial LPS, intracellular TNF-alpha and IL-8 production was diminished in maturing DC from CML patients. This distinct cytokine deficiency was overcome when leukaemic DC were stimulated with cytokines/PGE2. MLR showed fully functional leukaemic DC after TNF-alpha-induced maturation, but a reduced proliferative alloresponse of leukaemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further, intracellular production of cytokines in CML-derived T cells was markedly reduced. These data indicated that, in CML, the maturation response of leukaemic monocyte-derived DC to a natural stimulus like LPS is abnormal and may be caused by an aberrant TNF-alpha response in these cells. Thus, TNF-alpha alone or in combination with pro-inflammatory and T-cell stimulatory cytokines should be considered as an adjuvant for DC-based immunotherapy in CML.","['Eisendle, Klaus', 'Lang, Alois', 'Eibl, Brigitte', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Glassl, Herta', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Thaler, Joseph', 'Gastl, Guenther']","['Eisendle K', 'Lang A', 'Eibl B', 'Nachbaur D', 'Glassl H', 'Fiegl M', 'Thaler J', 'Gastl G']","['Laboratory for Tumour and Immunobiology, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria. klaus.eisendle@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/02/06 04:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['3979 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.03979.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jan;120(1):63-73. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.03979.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism was substantiated by Western blotting of the BCR-ABL expression level of CML cells, and the efficacy was substantiated by inhibition of colony formation compared with normal hematopoietic cells. The clonogenicity of K-562 cells expressing high levels of p210(BCR-ABL) was inhibited significantly by the ASO-bcr (T/C%, 30; P < 0.05) but not by ErPC3 (T/C%, 70). Combined sequential exposure to ErPC3 and the ASO-bcr, however, inhibited synergistically colony growth (T/C%, 3; P < 0.01). The colony growth of BV-173 cells expressing lower levels of p210(BCR-ABL) than K562 cells was inhibited to a greater extent by the ASO-bcr (T/C%, 15; P < 0.01). AR-230 cells that express high levels of p230(BCR-ABL) showed an intermediate decrease in colony formation in response to the ASO-bcr (T/C%, 20; P < 0.05). BCR-ABL levels of BV-173, CML-T1, and LAMA-84 cells were reduced in response to the ASO-bcr, as evidenced by Western blot. However, K-562 and AR-230 cells showed reduced BCR-ABL expression only after repeated treatment. ErPC3 and the ASO-bcr did not reduce colony formation (CFU-GM) of normal mouse bone marrow cells from long-term bone marrow cell cultures; instead, ErPC3 stimulated colony formation (P < 0.05) and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow. In conclusion, the combination of ErPC3 with a suitable antisense oligonucleotide inhibited synergistically colony formation of CML cell lines without damaging normal cells and thus might have a bearing on the purging of autologous hematopoietic transplants in CML patients.","['Konstantinov, Spiro M', 'Georgieva, Milka C', 'Topashka-Ancheva, Margarita', 'Eibl, Hansjorg', 'Berger, Martin R']","['Konstantinov SM', 'Georgieva MC', 'Topashka-Ancheva M', 'Eibl H', 'Berger MR']","['Unit of Toxicology and Chemotherapy, German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/21 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/12/21 04:00'],"['2002/12/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 Aug;1(10):877-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is autoimmune in nature and characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue in multiple joints, which leads to joint destruction, although the etiopathogenesis has not been elucidated completely. It is remarkable that expression of inflammatory cytokines is augmented in the joints. We previously reported on an inflammatory arthropathy resembling RA that develops in high incidence among transgenic (Tg) mice that carry the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) tax gene. Autoimmune pathogenesis was suggested in this RA model, and levels of cytokines including IL-1 were elevated in the joints of these Tg mice. Depletion of IL-1 by gene targeting greatly reduced the incidence of the disease, indicating the importance of this cytokine in the development of arthritis. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)-deficient mice develop autoimmunity and arthritis spontaneously. These observations suggest that excess IL-1 signaling causes autoimmunity. We show that IL-1 activates the immune system non-specifically by inducing CD40L and OX40 co-signaling molecules on T cells. In this review, the roles of IL-1 in the development of autoimmunity and arthritis will be discussed in correlation with the development of new drugs.","['Iwakura, Yoichiro']",['Iwakura Y'],"['Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. iwakura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

To determine its antitumor activity in combination with cyclophosphamide, we initiated a Phase II trial of the two agents in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with refractory or recurrent CLL or PLL received cladribine 4 mg/m(2)/day and cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m(2)/day (both administered intravenously) for 3 days every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Eleven patients (38%), nine with CLL and two with PLL, had a response. The median duration of response was 12 months. Severe extrahematologic toxicity (National Cancer Institute Grade 3-4) occurred in two patients, consisting of skin rash in one patient and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the other. The most common form of hematologic toxicity was severe neutropenia, which developed after 25% of the 84 courses was administered. Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia developed after 12% and 7% of the courses, respectively, and five episodes of anemia were immunomediated. In addition, three major infections resulted in the death of one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Although inferior to the combination fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, this regimen showed interesting activity in patients with advanced CLL or PLL. Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxic effect.","['Montillo, Marco', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Montillo M', 'Tedeschi A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Di Raimondo F', 'Lerner S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Morra E', 'Keating MJ']","[""Department of Oncology/Haematology, Division of Haematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza dell'Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20161 Milan, Italy. m.montillo@tiscali.it""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11000 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 1;97(1):114-20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11000.,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)-based detection of TEL/AML1 represents an accurate technique for the reproducible assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). METHODS: The authors employed RQ-reverse transcriptase-PCR (RQ-RT-PCR) technology to analyze MRD levels in 57 newly diagnosed patients with TEL/AML1 positive ALL in a prospective study. RESULTS: On Day + 33, a particularly important time point in terms of outcome prediction based on MRD monitoring, 75% of patients reached negativity, 13% of patients were positive at very low levels (< 10(-4); i.e., 1 or more leukemic cell per 10(4) normal cells), and another 13% of patients were positive at the level of 10(-2) to 10(-4) cells. No patient showed MRD levels > or = 10(-2) cells at this time. The data demonstrate that patients with TEL/AML1 positive ALL had a better response to induction chemotherapy on Day + 33 compared with a group of unselected patients with ALL (P = 0.0001). However, four patients with TEL/AML1 positive ALL developed relapse disease. Remarkably, these children were positive for MRD on Day + 33 at a level between 10(-2) cells and 10(-4) (n = 3 patients) and at < 10(-4) (n = 1 patient). Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease free survival showed the statistical significance of this distribution (MRD positive vs. MRD negative; log-rank P = 0.0016). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that, although the TEL/AML1 positive leukemias generally are associated with a favorable outcome, MRD positivity assessed by RQ-RT-PCR analysis at the end of induction therapy represents a significantly negative prognostic feature.","['Madzo, Jozef', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Muzikova, Katerina', 'Kalinova, Marketa', 'Krejci, Ondrej', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Otova, Berta', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan']","['Madzo J', 'Zuna J', 'Muzikova K', 'Kalinova M', 'Krejci O', 'Hrusak O', 'Otova B', 'Stary J', 'Trka J']","['Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11043 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jan 1;97(1):105-13. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11043.,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, we compared the immune reconstitution following these two transplant modalities in patients receiving T-cell depleted grafts for hematological malignancies and studied the impact of lymphocyte subset recovery on clinical outcome. METHODS: Conditioning for transplantation was radiation-based, while graft versus host disease prophylaxis was by ex vivo T-cell depletion with Campath-1 antibodies. Clinical parameters of patients receiving bone marrow or cytokine-mobilized progenitor cell transplants were reviewed with emphasis placed on defining infectious events and on the causes of treatment failure (relapse, graft failure, or any cause of death). The blood lymphoid subsets, as well as markers for memory and naive T cells, were sequentially studied by standard flow cytometry. Serum immunoglobulins (Ig) concentrations were also determined. RESULTS: The patient population included 15 females and 27 males with a median age of 32.5 (range 15-54) years. Source of human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling allogeneic grafts was bone marrow in 14 and peripheral blood (PBPC) in 28. The median follow-up was of 1,278 (range 47-2,466) days. Following hematopoietic recovery, within the first year, 28 patients were readmitted for pyrexial episodes, and four died of sepsis. In both groups, while the CD8+ subset recuperated rapidly, CD19 and CD4+ T cells remained significantly decreased even after 12 months, leading to persistently abnormal CD4:CD8 ratios. The median values of CD16+ and CD56+ (natural killer) cells remained normal throughout the study period. Despite the patients who were receiving PBPC grafts having significantly higher numbers of allogeneic mononuclear cells (x 10(8)/kg; median: 6.97; range 4.03-10.10 vs. 0.71; range 0.45-0.99; P<0.001) and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages (CFU-GMs) (x 10(4)/kg; median: 27.75; range 0-196, 2 vs. 13.05; range 2.43-57; P<0.05), the recovery rate of B cells or T-cell subpopulations was similar to those receiving bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Double fluorescence studies showed that CD2/CD45RO and RA as well as CD4/CD45RO and RA remained subnormal even after 12 months follow-up. During the observation period, except for IgA, normal levels of immunoglobulins were detected. In all, 18 out of 42 patients failed therapy, and 14 patients died. Treatment failure occurred at a median of 270 (range 47-1,638) days and was significantly associated with low total lymphocyte count (P = 0.01), CD2 (P = 0.09), CD8 (P = 0.01), CD19 (P = 0.02), CD45RA (P = 0.05), and CD4/CD45RA (P = 0.01), when tested at 6 months from transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: After T-cell depleted allogeneic PBPC or BMT, no differences in the rate of immune recovery were detected. However, patients with specific subset abnormalities at 6 months from grafting had a significantly higher risk of treatment failure.","['Novitzky, Nicolas', 'Davison, Glenda M', 'Hale, Geoffrey', 'Waldmann, Herman']","['Novitzky N', 'Davison GM', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. novitzky@cormack.uct.ac.za.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*physiopathology/*surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*physiopathology', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukapheresis', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200212150-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2002 Dec 15;74(11):1551-9. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200212150-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United approximately 3250 cases are diagnosed annually in children and adolescents younger than 20 years, of whom 2400 have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment results in childhood ALL continue to improve, and the expected current cure rates approach 75 to 80% of all children with ALL, including T-ALL and mature B-cell ALL, the two variants that, not too long ago, had a considerably poorer prognosis compared with the common form of BpALL. The most significant new development in the past 2 years has been the development of further evidence for fetal origin of childhood leukemias, and additional evidence to support the notion that postnatal events modulating the events of immune-mediated elimination of these leukemic clones play a major role in the eventual development of clinical disease. Other epidemiologic developments include (1) increased appreciation of the role of drug-metabolizing enzymes, both in determining the predisposition to leukemia and response to therapy; and (2) both clinical observations and gene expression studies seeming to identify a new approach to the evaluation and treatment of children with MLL (11q23) rearrangements. A most remarkable new development in the induction therapy of childhood leukemia and lymphoma in the United States is the use of urate oxidase for prevention of tumor lysis syndrome and the associated uric acid nephropathy. Drug resistance, determined either on leukemic blast cells in vitro or by studies of MRD, is being looked at critically in an effort to improve the treatment results further. Consolidation with HDMTX has gained wider popularity with the realization that effective CNS prophylaxis can be achieved with intrathecal therapy plus HDMTX for consolidation. In contrast to ALL, the progress in the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lags behind, with cure rates of approximately 40 to 50%. There is no convincing evidence for substitution of daunorubicin with other anthracyclines, nor evidence for using high-dose cytarabine during induction in childhood AML. Rather, a 3 + 10 regimen with total daunorubicin 180 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 to 200 mg/2 for 10 days appears to yield the best results. The most important component of the postremission chemotherapy continues to be several courses of high-dose cytarabine. The results from the MRC 10, LAME 89/91 studies and the recent BFM 93 trial with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone suggest that there may be some benefit to including this combination in the postremission phase of AML. Despite these improvements in chemotherapy, allogeneic BMT from a matched family donor remains the best option for most patients (excluding Down syndrome, APL, and possibly those with inv16). Newer prognostic markers of interest include FLT3/ITD and minimal residual disease at the end of induction therapy.","['Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi']",['Ravindranath Y'],"[""Wayne State University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, 48201,USA. ravi@med.wayne.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200301000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2003 Jan;15(1):23-35. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200301000-00004.,,,149,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients with myelodysplastic syndrome are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation because of advanced age, comorbid illnesses, and lack of a histocompatible donor. Increased rates of apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitors, altered production of inflammatory cytokines, neoangiogenesis, and autoreactive T lymphocytes have all been shown to contribute to the phenotype of myelodysplastic syndrome.

However, the mode of delivery and targets of neurotrophin action are still under debate. For instance, cortical NT-4/5 (neurotrophin 4/5; Ntf4/5) was shown to rescue lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons from monocular deprivation-induced atrophy suggesting a retrograde action on thalamic afferents. It is still unclear whether LGN neurons respond to NT-4/5 and other neurotrophins during development in animals with normal vision. We now show that infusions of NT-4/5 and NGF (nerve growth factor) into visual cortex at the onset and the peak of the critical period accelerated LGN neuron growth. BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) was ineffective. The effects of neurotrophin on LGN development were clearly dissociated from the effects at cortical level because soma growth of cortical layer IV and VI neurons was strongly promoted by BDNF. NT-4/5 was only effective at the onset, but no longer at the peak of the critical period suggesting a switch in neurotrophin dependency for these cortical cell classes. To dissociate retrograde and anterograde effects of the TrkB ligands, we analyzed the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS) of the superior colliculus, a target of visual cortical efferents. Indeed, TrkB-expressing inhibitory SGS neurons responded to cortical NT-4/5 infusion with somatic growth. Strikingly, the TrkB-expressing excitatory tectothalamic calbindin neurons in the SGS did not respond. This demonstrated for the first time a selective cell type-specific anterograde action of NT-4/5 and suggested for the LGN that anterograde as well as retrograde effects contribute to soma size regulation. Strikingly, cortical infusion of the cytokine LIF, which affects development of visual cortex neurochemical architecture, transiently inhibited growth of neurons in LGN, cortical layer IV and VI and SGS. In summary, the study presents three important results. First, central neurons regulate soma size development in an age-and ligand-specific fashion. Second, NT-4/5 and NGF accelerate LGN development in rats with normal vision while LIF delays growth. Third, anterogradely transported NT-4/5 effectively promotes neuronal maturation. These differential actions on subcortical neurons may contribute to the different effects of neurotrophins on visual system development and plasticity.","['Wahle, Petra', 'Di Cristo, Graziella', 'Schwerdtfeger, Gudrun', 'Engelhardt, Maren', 'Berardi, Nicoletta', 'Maffei, Lamberto']","['Wahle P', 'Di Cristo G', 'Schwerdtfeger G', 'Engelhardt M', 'Berardi N', 'Maffei L']","['AG Entwicklungsneurobiologie ND 6/72, Fakultat fur Biologie, Ruhr-Universitat, 44780 Bochum, Germany. wahle@neurobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '145172-44-7 (neurotrophin 5)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Afferent Pathways/cytology/drug effects/growth & development', 'Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Efferent Pathways/cytology/drug effects/growth & development', 'Geniculate Bodies/cytology/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Superior Colliculi/cytology/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Visual Cortex/cytology/drug effects/growth & development', 'Visual Pathways/cytology/drug effects/growth & development']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/dev.00224 [doi]'],ppublish,Development. 2003 Feb;130(3):611-22. doi: 10.1242/dev.00224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In microarray data the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of cases (arrays), and thus filtering and pre-selection of genes is required. We describe the application of Between Group Analysis (BGA) to the analysis of microarray data. A feature of BGA is that it can be used when the number of variables (genes) exceeds the number of cases (arrays). BGA is based on carrying out an ordination of groups of samples, using a standard method such as Correspondence Analysis (COA), rather than an ordination of the individual microarray samples. As such, it can be viewed as a method of carrying out COA with grouped data. RESULTS: We illustrate the power of the method using two cancer data sets. In both cases, we can quickly and accurately classify test samples from any number of specified a priori groups and identify the genes which characterize these groups. We obtained very high rates of correct classification, as determined by jack-knife or validation experiments with training and test sets. The results are comparable to those from other methods in terms of accuracy but the power and flexibility of BGA make it an especially attractive method for the analysis of microarray cancer data.","['Culhane, Aedin C', 'Perriere, Guy', 'Considine, Elizabeth C', 'Cotter, Thomas G', 'Higgins, Desmond G']","['Culhane AC', 'Perriere G', 'Considine EC', 'Cotter TG', 'Higgins DG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

Relative levels of mRNA encoding IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were measured in fresh and concanavalin A (Con A) activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4+ T cells from cows seronegative to BLV (BLV-), seropositive without persistent lymphocytosis (BLV+PL-), and seropositive with PL (BLV+PL+) using a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The expressions of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 mRNAs were significantly reduced in the PBMCs from BLV+PL+ cows as compared to BLV- cows. Reduced levels of IL-2 and IL-4 mRNAs were detected in fresh CD4+ T cells from BLV+PL+ cows. In contrast, Con A stimulated PBMCs and CD4+ T cells did not differ significantly in expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10, or IL-4 mRNAs among the BLV infection groups. Using flow-sorted CD4+ T cells and semiquantitative RT-PCR the frequencies of CD4+ T cells transcribing IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 mRNAs in the peripheral blood of BLV-, BLV+PL-, and BLV+PL+ cows were determined. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing these cytokine mRNAs among animals in the different BLV infection categories. Thus, the observed differences in IL-2 and IL-4 mRNAs in CD4+ T cells were due to changes in steady-state mRNA levels expressed by individual cells and not to changes in the frequency of cells transcribing IL-2 and IL-4 mRNAs. These results demonstrate that the progression of BLV infection to PL is associated with reduced expression of classical Th1 and Th2 cytokines by CD4+ T cells, thus suggesting aberrant Th regulation in subclinically infected animals.","['Amills, Marcel', 'Ramiya, Vijayakumar', 'Norimine, Junzo', 'Olmstead, Colleen A', 'Lewin, Harris A']","['Amills M', 'Ramiya V', 'Norimine J', 'Olmstead CA', 'Lewin HA']","['Departments of Animal Sciences, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois 61801, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/07 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S004268220291651X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1651 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Dec 5;304(1):1-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line is unique in its response to the ecotropic MLV envelope (Env) protein in that it undergoes syncytium formation with cells expressing Env protein containing R peptide (R+ Env), which is known to suppress the fusogenic potential of the Env protein in other susceptible cells. To assess whether this property of the XC cell line arises from differences in its ecotropic MLV receptor, CAT1, we isolated CAT1 cDNA clones from XC cells. A variant CAT1 (xcCAT1) was found together with the wild-type rat CAT1 (rCAT1). xcCAT1 cDNA encodes a protein with a single amino acid change that destroys a conserved N-linked glycosylation site proximal to the Env-binding motif. We found that xcCAT1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells undergoes less glycosylation than rCAT1 and that the expression of xcCAT1 rendered the CHO cells more susceptible to infection with Moloney MLV. Thus, N-glycosylation negatively regulates the receptor activity of rCAT1. This is supported by the observation that treatment of rat F10 cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin enhanced their susceptibility to Mo-MLV. However, xcCAT1-expressing CHO cells did not fuse with 293T cells expressing R+ Env, indicating that xcCAT1 expression is not sufficient to induce the XC cell-specific characteristic of forming syncytia in response to R+ Env.","['Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Ono, Takeshi', 'Ogura, Miki', 'Ishimoto, Akinori', 'Amanuma, Hiroshi']","['Kubo Y', 'Ono T', 'Ogura M', 'Ishimoto A', 'Amanuma H']","['Molecular Cell Science Laboratory, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. yoshinao@postman.riken.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/17 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202916417 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1641 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Nov 25;303(2):338-44. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1641.,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB066224'],,,,,

Although conventional chemotherapy can cure between 25 and 45% of AML patients, most patients will either die of relapse or die from the complications associated with treatment. Thus, more specific and less toxic treatments for AML patients are needed. Recently, a small molecular inhibitor (STI571 or Gleevec) that targets the BCR-ABL gene was found to have a dramatic clinical effect in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These results have encouraged investigators to search for additional small molecular inhibitors and other targeted therapies that may be applicable to other forms of leukemia. In this review, we examine some of the signaling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in AML, focusing on the tyrosine kinase/RAS/MAP kinase and JAK/STAT pathways. After reviewing these two pathways, we explore some of the targeted therapies directed at these pathways that are under development for AML, many of which are already in clinical trials.","['Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Stirewalt DL', 'Meshinchi S', 'Radich JP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, The Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle 98109, USA. dstirewa@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Mutation', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/10/09 05:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0268960X02000577 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(02)00057-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2003 Mar;17(1):15-23. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(02)00057-7.,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we found that LIF is expressed at low but detectable levels in postpubertal, adult virgin, and pregnant mouse mammary glands. However, LIF expression drops after parturition to become almost undetectable in lactating glands. Interestingly, LIF expression shows a steep increase shortly after weaning that is maintained for the following 3 days. During this period, known as the first stage of mammary gland involution, the lack of suckling induces local factors that cause extensive epithelial cell death. It has been shown that Stat3 is the main factor in signaling the initiation of apoptosis, but the mechanism of its activation remains unclear. Herein, we show that LIF expression in the gland is induced by milk stasis and not by the decrease of circulating lactogenic hormones after weaning. Implantation of LIF containing pellets in lactating glands results in a significant increase in epithelium apoptosis. In addition, this treatment also induces Stat3 phosphorylation. We conclude that LIF regulated expression in the mouse mammary gland may play a relevant role during the first stage of mammary gland involution. Our results also show that LIF-induced mammary epithelium apoptosis could be mediated, at least partially, by Stat3 activation.","['Schere-Levy, Carolina', 'Buggiano, Valeria', 'Quaglino, Ana', 'Gattelli, Albana', 'Cirio, Maria Cecilia', 'Piazzon, Isabel', 'Vanzulli, Silvia', 'Kordon, Edith C']","['Schere-Levy C', 'Buggiano V', 'Quaglino A', 'Gattelli A', 'Cirio MC', 'Piazzon I', 'Vanzulli S', 'Kordon EC']","['ILEX-CONICET Division de Medicina Experimental, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Estrous Cycle/physiology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Lactation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482702956661 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.2002.5666 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Jan 1;282(1):35-47. doi: 10.1006/excr.2002.5666.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we monitored the subcellular distribution of nuclear proteins in correlation with proteasomes. The proteasomal pathway clears away endogenous proteins, regulates numerous cellular processes, and delivers immunocompetent peptides to the antigen presenting machinery. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that histones, splicing factor SC35, spliceosomal components, such as U1-70k or SmB/B('), and PML partially colocalize with 20S proteasomes in nucleoplasmic substructures, whereas the centromeric and nucleolar proteins topoisomerase I, fibrillarin, and UBF did not overlap with proteasomes. The specific inhibition of proteasomal processing with lactacystin induced accumulation of histone protein H2A, SC35, spliceosomal components, and PML, suggesting that these proteins are normally degraded by proteasomes. In contrast, concentrations of centromeric proteins CENP-B and -C and nucleolar proteins remained constant during inhibition of proteasomes. Quantification of fluorescence intensities corroborated that nuclear proteins which colocalize with proteasomes are degraded by proteasome-dependent proteolysis within the nucleoplasm.

Because many proteins with different functions aggregate in PML bodies, it has also been suggested that these bodies function as nuclear depots. Some proteins consistently found in PML bodies may form a stable scaffold that regulates the recruitment of other proteins. Thus, some proteins might be stably integrated into PML bodies while others continuously exchange with the nucleoplasm. To study the dynamic properties of PML bodies and resident proteins, we constructed fusion proteins of Sp100, PML, and CBP with autofluorescent proteins. Using time-lapse imaging, we show that PML bodies exhibit little movement but that small foci that contain Sp100 but not PML are dynamic and fuse with PML bodies. Furthermore, we show by monitoring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching that Sp100, PML, and CBP are dynamic components of PML bodies.

In G1 phase of the cell cycle more than 70% of PML bodies contain active transcription foci. A similarly high degree of colocalization (approx 80%) between PML bodies and sites of active transcription was also observed when the cells were exposed to interferon-gamma.

In bone marrow cells from patients with acute leukemia, the TA was ranging from 0 to 0.96 U with a mean value of 0.42 +/- 0.26 U. The positive rate was 78.1% which was significantly different from that in normal bone marrow (BM) (P < 0.01). In case of myelodysplastic syndrome, the average level of TA was 0.27 +/- 0.19 U (ranging from 0 to 0.97 U) with a positive rate of 66.7%. In comparison with normal BM cells, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Particularly, the MDS high-risk subgroup exhibited a significantly higher activity of telomerase (P < 0.05). In comparison with INT-1 and INT-2 subgroups in MDS patients based on international prognostic scoring system (IPPS), the difference in TA was also significant (P < 0.05). The abnormality in cell karyotype was not correlated with TA. CONCLUSION: The normal bone marrow cells demonstrate TA at a marginal level while a remarkably increasing level may be seen in acute leukemia patients. The BM cells from MDS patients display a moderate TA among which the high risk MDS subgroup with a poor prognostic IPPS score exhibited markedly higher TA.","['Fu, Chengcheng', 'Chen, Zixing']","['Fu C', 'Chen Z']","['First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2002 Oct;115(10):1475-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the cognitive dysfunction, male Wistar rats were given multiple intracerebroventricular injections of methotrexate. Its effect on behaviour was tested in the two-compartment conditioned avoidance task and dark-bright arena test. Levels of brain amines in the hippocampal region of the brain were estimated by HPLC. The qualitative and quantitative histopathological changes in the different regions of the hippocampus were studied by cresyl violet staining. Multiple injections (1 or 2 mg/kg) produced convulsions and learning and memory impairment but did not induce anxiolytic activity. They also reduced concentrations of all three brain amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The CA4 region of the hippocampus was severely affected by intraventricular methotrexate. Disruption of brain monoamines has been proposed as a cause of brain dysfunction from this chemotherapy, and that disruption may in turn involve cytotoxic effects of methotrexate on brain tissue. The outcomes of this study may have therapeutic implications in the management of cancer conditions, particularly in childhood lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Madhyastha, Sampath', 'Somayaji, S N', 'Rao, M S', 'Nalini, K', 'Bairy, K Laxminarayana']","['Madhyastha S', 'Somayaji SN', 'Rao MS', 'Nalini K', 'Bairy KL']","['Department of Anatomy, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Karnataka 576 119, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Biogenic Amines)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avoidance Learning/drug effects/physiology', 'Biogenic Amines/*metabolism', 'Conditioning, Psychological/drug effects/physiology', 'Hippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/y02-135 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2002 Nov;80(11):1076-84. doi: 10.1139/y02-135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GATA-1 transcription factor was then monitored during erythroid differentiation induced by aclacinomycin.

Such cytotoxicity was dose- and time-dependent. At concentrations below 5 microM, AA was not toxic; at 10-400 microM, AA induced apoptosis and at concentrations beyond 400 microM, necrosis. The minimum exposure time to trigger cell death was of around 1 h, but the effect was increased by longer exposure times until 6-24 h. Apoptosis was morphologically characterized by a decrease in cell and nuclear volume, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation and the presence of lipid bodies, without changes in organelle integrity. Biochemically, AA-induced apoptosis was associated with internucleosomal fragmentation and caspase activation, evaluated by PARP cleavage and the use of a caspase inhibitor. Necrosis was characterized by increased cell volume, presence of loose chromatin, appearance of vacuoles, loss of membrane integrity and of the definition of organelles. The apoptotic effect of AA was studied as to oxidative-reductive imbalance and the participation of eicosanoids. Apoptotic AA treatment was accompanied by an increase in the quantity of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), low-level chemiluminescence and in the glutathione disulfide/reduced glutathione ratio, indicating oxidative stress. The addition of tocopherol, ascorbate, prostaglandin E2 and lipoxygenase inhibitors delayed cell death, whereas the inhibition of cyclooxygenase promoted AA-induced cell death. Cell treatment with AA was accompanied by increased cellular production of LTB4. AA, therefore, is cytotoxic at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations, causing apoptosis and necrosis.

Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils, reduced infections, and improved survival. Some responders with congenital neutropenia (termed Kostmann's syndrome herein) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, which raises the question of the role of G-CSF in pathogenesis. The issue is complicated because both disorders have a propensity for MDS or AML as part of their natural history. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To address this, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry used its large database of chronic neutropenia patients treated with G-CSF to determine the incidence of malignant myeloid transformation in the two disorders, and its relationship to treatment and to other patient characteristics. RESULTS: As of January 2001, of the 383 patients with congenital forms of neutropenia in the Registry, 48 had MDS or AML (crude rate, about 12.5%). No statistically significant relationships were found between age at onset of MDS or AML and patient gender, G-CSF dose, or duration of G-CSF therapy. What was observed, however, was the multistep acquisition of aberrant cellular genetic changes in marrow cells from Kostmann's syndrome patients who transformed, including activating ras oncogene mutations, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and G-CSF receptor mutations. The latter in murine models produces a hyperproliferative response to G-CSF, confers resistance to apoptosis, and enhances cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: Since Kostmann's syndrome and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome are inherited forms of bone marrow failure, G-CSF may accelerate the propensity for MDS/AML in the genetically altered stem and progenitor cells, especially in those with G-CSF receptor and ras mutations (82% and 50% of Kostmann's syndrome patients who transform, respectively). Alternatively, and equally plausible, G-CSF may simply be an innocent bystander that corrects neutropenia, prolongs patient survival, and allows time for the malignant predisposition to declare itself. Only careful long-term follow-up of the cohort of patients receiving G-CSF will provide the answer.","['Freedman, Melvin H', 'Alter, Blanche P']","['Freedman MH', 'Alter BP']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. melvin.freedman@sickkids.on.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr Med Assoc J,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100930740,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Databases, Factual', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Neutropenia/complications/congenital/drug therapy', 'Registries']",,2002/12/20 04:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/12/20 04:00'],"['2002/12/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr Med Assoc J. 2002 Nov;4(11):1011-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reasoned that because tumors are masses of rapidly dividing cells, they would be most efficiently transduced with vector systems allowing transgene propagation. We thus designed two replicative retrovirus-derived vector systems: one inherently replicative vector, and one defective vector propagated by a helper retrovirus. In vitro, both systems achieved very efficient transgene propagation. In immunocompetent mice, replicative vectors transduced >85% tumor cells, whereas defective vectors transduced <1% under similar conditions. It is noteworthy that viral propagation could be efficiently blocked by azido-thymidine, in vitro and in vivo. In a model of established brain tumors treated with suicide genes, replicative retroviral vectors (RRVs) were approximately 1000 times more efficient than defective adenoviral vectors. These results demonstrate the advantage and potential of RRVs and strongly support their development for cancer gene therapy.","['Solly, Sounkary K', 'Trajcevski, Stephane', 'Frisen, Charlotte', 'Holzer, Georg W', 'Nelson, Elisabeth', 'Clerc, Beatrice', 'Abordo-Adesida, Evelyn', 'Castro, Maria', 'Lowenstein, Pedro', 'Klatzmann, David']","['Solly SK', 'Trajcevski S', 'Frisen C', 'Holzer GW', 'Nelson E', 'Clerc B', 'Abordo-Adesida E', 'Castro M', 'Lowenstein P', 'Klatzmann D']","['Biologie et Therapeutique des Pathologies Immunitaires, CNRS/UPMC UMR 7087, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy/virology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",,2002/12/19 04:00,2003/10/17 05:00,['2002/12/19 04:00'],"['2002/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700521 [doi]', '7700521 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2003 Jan;10(1):30-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700521.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas bryostatin 1 and UCN-01 both markedly enhanced ara-C-induced mitochondrial injury (e.g., cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential), caspase activation, and apoptosis, ectopic expression of an N-terminal loop-deleted Bcl-2 mutant protein protected cells from ara-C/UCN-01- but not ara-C/bryostatin 1-mediated lethality. Conversely, ectopic expression of CrmA or dominant-negative caspase-8 abrogated potentiation of ara-C-mediated apoptosis by bryostatin 1 but not by UCN-01. Exposure of cells to ara-C and bryostatin 1 (but not UCN-01) resulted in sustained release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; moreover, potentiation of ara-C lethality by bryostatin 1 (but not by UCN-01) was reversed by coadministration of TNF soluble receptors or the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (1 microM). Finally, similar events were observed in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Together, these findings suggest that potentiation of ara-C lethality in human myeloid leukemia cells by bryostatin 1 but not UCN-01 involves activation of the extrinsic, receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, and represents a consequence of bryostatin 1-mediated release of TNF-alpha. They also argue that the mechanism by which bryostatin 1 promotes ara-C-induced mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis involves factors other than or in addition to PKC down-regulation or modulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation status.","['Wang, Shujie', 'Wang, Zhiliang', 'Grant, Steven']","['Wang S', 'Wang Z', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bryostatins', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Deletion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Maleimides', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2002/12/19 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/12/19 04:00'],"['2002/12/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.63.1.232 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2003 Jan;63(1):232-42. doi: 10.1124/mol.63.1.232.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without intervention the disease progresses from a benign chronic phase to a rapidly fatal blast crisis. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on a model we have previously described using the expression of a conditional mutant of Bcr-Abl PTK in a multipotent stem cell line, FDCP-Mix. Long term exposure of FDCP-Mix cells to Bcr-Abl mimics disease progression in CML. Four major differences were observed as a consequence of long term exposure to the Bcr-Abl PTK compared with cells exposed short term. The proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry-generated peptide mass fingerprint data and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-generated sequence information. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase, an enzyme known to be deregulated in CML, was found to be up-regulated. Annexin VI, vacuolar ATP synthase catalytic subunit A, and mortalin were found to be down-regulated. Poly(A) PCR cDNA analysis showed there was no correlation between the protein expression changes and mRNA levels. Western blot analysis also indicated no change in the levels of mortalin or leukotriene A4 hydrolase, indicating that post-translational events may modify protein content of the specific spots. Leukotriene B4 levels (product of leukotriene A4 hydrolase) were, however, reduced in cells exposed long term to Bcr-Abl activity.

However, the data are inconsistent with regard to acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and leukemia-free survival (LFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 2000, 3,465 adult patients (older than 15 years of age) were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry from 224 centers. Among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 1,537 patients received BM and 757 patients received PBSC. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, the corresponding figures were 826 versus 345 patients who were analyzed for engraftment, GVHD, TRM, relapse, LFS, and survival. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, the recovery of neutrophils and platelets was faster with PBSC than with BM (P <.0001). Chronic GVHD was associated with PBSC in patients with AML (relative risk [RR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.66 to 2.7; P <.0001) and ALL (RR, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.27; P =.02). PBSC versus BM in patients with AML or ALL was not significantly associated with acute GVHD, TRM, relapse, survival, or LFS. In multivariate analysis of patients with AML, factors significantly associated with improved LFS included first remission at transplant (P <.0001), promyelocytic leukemia (M3) versus other French-American-British types (P <.0001), and donor age below median 37 years (P =.02). In patients with ALL, first remission (P <.0001) and methotrexate included in the immunosuppressive regimen (P =.001) were associated with improved LFS. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic PBSC results in faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment and a higher incidence of chronic GVHD than BM. However, acute GVHD, TRM, relapse, survival, and LFS were similar in patients receiving PBSCs versus BM.","['Ringden, O', 'Labopin, M', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Arcese, W', 'Schaefer, U W', 'Willemze, R', 'Koc, H', 'Bunjes, D', 'Gluckman, E', 'Rocha, V', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Frassoni, F']","['Ringden O', 'Labopin M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Arcese W', 'Schaefer UW', 'Willemze R', 'Koc H', 'Bunjes D', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V', 'Schattenberg A', 'Frassoni F']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Huddinge, Sweden.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was designed to examine the incidence and nature of unlicensed and off label prescribing, in paediatric oncology patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and other malignancies. Inpatient and outpatient prescriptions were analysed for a 4-week period. RESULTS: All patients received at least one unlicensed or off label drug. Fifty-five per cent of prescriptions were licensed, 19% were unlicensed and 26% were licensed drugs used in an off label manner. Unlicensed preparations were used in 40% of prescriptions for cytotoxic agents, due to a lack of commercially available formulations suitable for the paediatric patient. These drugs included mercaptopurine and methotrexate which have been used in the treatment of paediatric leukaemia for many years, their efficacy having been demonstrated by on-going Medical Research Council trials. CONCLUSIONS: It is disappointing that drugs, which are the mainstay of therapy for paediatric leukaemia and other malignancies, are unavailable in appropriate licensed formulations to facilitate their administration to children.

This cross-talk may act at several levels, including an interaction between the transcription factors involved in the signalling pathways. In the present paper, we demonstrate a novel functional interaction between GC and all- trans -retinoic acid (RA) signalling. We show that, in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, GCs potentiate RA-induced expression of the murine Hoxb -1 gene through an autoregulatory element, b1-ARE, recognized by the Pbx1 and HOXB1 homoeodomain proteins. The synergistic effect of GC did not involve GC receptor (GR) binding to the b1-ARE, and the GC-GR complex alone was unable to activate transcription via the element. Furthermore, the ability of the GR to transactivate was not required, excluding expression of a GC-induced protein as the mechanism for the GC/RA synergy. Additional transfection experiments showed that the Pbx1/HOXB1 heterodimer was the target for the GC effect. Furthermore, functional dissection of the GR demonstrated that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the GR was required for the synergy. A physical interaction between the GR and Pbx1 proteins was demonstrated in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These results are compatible with a model in which the GC/RA synergy is mediated by a direct interaction between the GR and Pbx1. On the basis of the ubiquitous expression of both GR and Pbx1, a number of genes regulated by Pbx are likely to be important targets for GC-mediated 'cross-talk'.","['Subramaniam, Nanthakumar', 'Campion, Javier', 'Rafter, Ingalill', 'Okret, Sam']","['Subramaniam N', 'Campion J', 'Rafter I', 'Okret S']","['Department of Medical Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Novum, SE-141 86 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism', 'Hormone Antagonists/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",PMC1223238,2002/12/19 04:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2002/12/19 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20020471 [doi]', 'BJ20020471 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2003 Mar 15;370(Pt 3):1087-95. doi: 10.1042/BJ20020471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has long been regarded as a serious complication of this procedure. Although GVHD may affect any organ, intestinal GVHD is particularly important because of its frequency, severity and impact on the general condition of the patient. Recent studies have led to progressive elucidation of the mechanism of GVHD. Donor T cells are critical for the induction of GVHD, because depletion of T cells from bone marrow grafts effectively prevents GVHD but also results in an increase of leukaemia relapse. It has been shown that the gastrointestinal tract plays a major role in the amplification of systemic disease because gastrointestinal damage increases the translocation of endotoxins, which promotes further inflammation and additional gastrointestinal damage. Consequently, the management of intestinal GVHD (and the intestine itself) is a subject that should be highlighted. In this article, approaches to the prevention of intestinal GVHD are discussed after being classified into three categories: regimens in common clinical use, regimens under investigation and original regimens used at our hospital. The standard regimen that is used most widely for prevention of GVHD is cyclosporin plus short-term methotrexate. Corticosteroids can be added to this regimen but careful consideration of the adverse effects of these hormones should be considered. Tacrolimus is a newer, more potent alternative to cyclosporin. T-cell depletion (TCD) after transplantation has been shown to prevent acute GVHD, however, the survival benefit of TCD has not been as great as expected. Mycophenolate mofetil can be useful for the treatment of acute GVHD as part of combination therapy. Regimens currently under investigation in animal experiments include suppression of inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of T-cell activation, and, specifically at our institution, hepatocyte growth factor gene therapy. The evidence-based therapy used at our institution includes systemic antibacterial therapy (including eradication of intestinal bacteria) to prevent the intestinal translocation of lipopolysaccharide and avoid the subsequent increase of various inflammatory cytokines. In addition, because of the similarities between intestinal GVHD and ulcerative colitis, sulfasalazine, betamethasone enemas and eicosapentaenoic acid have been used to treat intestinal GVHD in some patients.","['Takatsuka, Hiroyuki', 'Iwasaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Okamoto, Takahiro', 'Kakishita, Eizo']","['Takatsuka H', 'Iwasaki T', 'Okamoto T', 'Kakishita E']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan. hematol@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Digestive System/*immunology/pathology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Sulfasalazine/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,2002/12/19 04:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2002/12/19 04:00'],"['2002/12/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['630101 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200363010-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2003;63(1):1-15. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200363010-00001.,,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, factors that regulate their actions in the heart are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that endothelin-1, a peptide hormone that produces a pattern of cardiac hypertrophy distinct from LIF and cardiotrophin-1, modulates LIF-induced signaling in cardiomyocytes. Upon binding LIF or cardiotrophin-1, the LIF receptor alpha subunit (LIFRalpha) dimerizes with gp130, leading to activation of constitutively associated Jak1 proteins and LIFRalpha-gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that pretreatment of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with endothelin-1 rapidly inhibited LIF-induced LIFRalpha tyrosine phosphorylation and Jak1 activation. This effect of endothelin-1 on LIFalpha and Jak1 was attenuated by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, implicating involvement of the ERK kinases. Radioligand binding studies showed that inhibition of LIF signaling resulted from a reduction in cell surface LlFRalpha levels. Additionally, endothelin-1 was found to reduce LIF-induced STAT3 activation, as indexed by STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation. Finally, endothelin-1 and LIF were shown to induce opposite patterns of STAT3 activation in cardiomyocytes. LIF induced rapid, robust STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation; endothelin-1 produced a delayed, modest increase, and initially decreased STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation. Overall our findings indicate that endothelin-1 acts to temper IL-6-related cytokine signaling in cardiomyocytes, in particular STAT3 activation.","['Booz, George W', 'Day, Jonathan N E', 'Speth, Robert', 'Baker, Kenneth M']","['Booz GW', 'Day JN', 'Speth R', 'Baker KM']","['The Cardiovascular Research Institute, Division of Molecular Cardiology, The Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Temple, TX 76504, USA. gbooz@medicine.tamu.edu']",['eng'],"['HL-44883/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-58439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-60529/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endothelin-1/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",,2002/12/19 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2002/12/19 04:00'],"['2002/12/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1020648425895 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2002 Nov;240(1-2):39-46. doi: 10.1023/a:1020648425895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low to intermediate risk Hodgkin's disease is treated by a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. The new chemotherapy protocol BEACOPP has improved the outcome of advanced stages in comparison with the internationally accepted standard protocol COPP/ABVD. Dependent on the initial staging, cure rates between 50 and 95% can be achieved.Indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas usually present in advanced stages of disease. Chemotherapy in these cases has palliative character and aims at improving patients'quality of life and at avoiding complications due to the disease. In aggressive and very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapy is curative and must be initiated immediately irrespective of the staging results. The efficacy of the standard protocol CHOP (cyclophosphamide,doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone), that was established in the 1970s, has recently been improved by shortening of the therapy interval (CHOP-14 vs.CHOP-21),addition of etoposide (CHOEP) and combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab (R-CHOP). The value of high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation has been shown unequivocally only for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed Hodgkin's disease responsive to chemotherapy. The therapeutic strategy of malignant lymphomas is likely to be improved within the next years due to the introduction of novel cytostatic agents, the broadening application of monoclonal antibodies,upcoming new transplantation procedures and the development of substances with molecular targets.

The demonstration that doxycycline induces APO 2.7 expression in CCRF-CEM cells in vitro also supports its capacity for induction of apoptosis.

CEM-7A cells consequently exhibited 10- and 68-fold decreased LCV and folic acid growth requirements and 23-25-fold hypersensitivity to MTX and edatrexate. Although CEM-7A cells displayed a 74-86-fold increase in the reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated influx of LCV and MTX, RFC overexpression per se cannot induce a prominently increased folate/MTX accumulation because RFC functions as a nonconcentrative anion exchanger. We therefore explored the possibility that folate efflux activity mediated by members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family was impaired in CEM-7A cells. Parental CEM cells expressed substantial levels of MRP1, MRP4, poor MRP5 levels, whereas MRP2, MRP3 and breast cancer resistance protein were undetectable. In contrast, CEM-7A cells lost 95% of MRP1 levels while retaining parental expression of MRP4 and MRP5. Consequently, CEM-7A cells displayed a 5-fold decrease in the [(3)H]folic acid efflux rate constant, which was identical to that obtained with parental CEM cells, when their folic acid efflux was blocked (78%) with probenecid. Furthermore, when compared with parental CEM, CEM-7A cells accumulated 2-fold more calcein fluorescence. Treatment of parental cells with the MRP1 efflux inhibitors MK571 and probenecid resulted in a 60-100% increase in calcein fluorescence. In contrast, these inhibitors failed to alter the calcein fluorescence in CEM-7A cells, which markedly lost MRP1 expression. Replenishment of LCV in the growth medium of CEM-7A cells resulted in resumption of normal MRP1 expression. These results establish for the first time that MRP1 is the primary folate efflux route in CEM leukemia cells and that the loss of folate efflux activity is an efficient means of markedly augmenting cellular folate pools. These findings suggest a functional role for MRP1 in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis.","['Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Rothem, Lilah', 'Hooijberg, Jan Hendrik', 'Stark, Michal', 'Ifergan, Ilan', 'Kathmann, Ietje', 'Dijkmans, Ben A C', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Jansen, Gerrit']","['Assaraf YG', 'Rothem L', 'Hooijberg JH', 'Stark M', 'Ifergan I', 'Kathmann I', 'Dijkmans BA', 'Peters GJ', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Biology, The Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel. assaraf@technion.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/18 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/12/18 04:00'],"['2002/12/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M209186200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32587-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Feb 28;278(9):6680-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M209186200.

Several lines of evidence suggest that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an important cytokine for the proliferation and survival of myoblasts in vitro and acceleration of skeletal muscle regeneration. To elucidate the role of LIF signaling in regenerative responses of skeletal muscles, we examined the spatial and temporal activation patterns of an LIF-associated signaling molecule, the signal transducer and activator transcription 3 (STAT3) proteins in regenerating rat skeletal muscles induced by crush injury. At the early stage of regeneration, activated STAT3 proteins were first detected in the nuclei of activated satellite cells and then continued to be activated in proliferating myoblasts expressing both PCNA and MyoD proteins. When muscle regeneration progressed, STAT3 signaling was no longer activated in differentiated myoblasts and myotubes. In addition, activation of STAT3 was also detected in myonuclei within intact sarcolemmas of surviving myofibers that did not show signs of necrosis. These findings suggest that activation of STAT3 signaling is an important molecular event that induces the successful regeneration of injured skeletal muscles.","['Kami, Katsuya', 'Senba, Emiko']","['Kami K', 'Senba E']","['Department of Health Science, Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences, Wakayama, Japan. kami@ouhs.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', '*Regeneration', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology']",,2002/12/18 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/12/18 04:00'],"['2002/12/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/002215540205001202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2002 Dec;50(12):1579-89. doi: 10.1177/002215540205001202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at determining the stage at which hematopoietic lineage fate is determined by manipulating the SCL/tal-1 expression that is known to be essential for the early development of the primitive and definitive hematopoietic systems. We established SCL-null ES cell lines in which SCL expression is rescued by tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase-loxP site-mediated recombination. While no hematopoietic cells (HPC) were detected in SCL-null ES cell differentiation cultures, SCL gene reactivation from day 2 to day 4 after initiation of differentiation could rescue both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. SCL reactivation at later phases was ineffective. Moreover, generation of VE-cadherin(+) EC that can give rise to definitive HPC required SCL reactivation prior to VE-cadherin expression. These results indicated that the competence to become HPC is acquired at the mesodermal stage by a SCL-dependent process that takes place independently of determination of endothelial fate.","['Endoh, Mitsuhiro', 'Ogawa, Minetaro', 'Orkin, Stuart', 'Nishikawa, Shin-ichi']","['Endoh M', 'Ogawa M', 'Orkin S', 'Nishikawa S']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8057, Japan. mendoh@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['U17 CE002005/CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Chickens', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Electroporation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endothelium/*embryology/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",PMC139094,2002/12/18 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2002/12/18 04:00'],"['2002/12/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdf674 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Dec 16;21(24):6700-8. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdf674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Marrow cells from 31 CML-BC patients were studied by bone marrow smears with morphological and cytochemical stain analysis. Immunophenotypic analysis was performed by micro blood method and flow cytometry. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using bone marrow cells prepared directly and or after 24 hours culture. RHG banding was used for karyotypic analysis. RESULTS: 23 patients (74.2%) were found to have myeloid blast crisis. 5 cases (16.1%) had a B-lymphoid immunophenotype and 4 of them expressed myeloid associated antigens at the same time. Another 3 cases were classified as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL 1 patient) and acute myeloid -lymphoid leukemia (AMLL 2 patients) with B and myeloid markers expression. A significant proportion (67.7%) of blast crisis cases were CD(34) positive. CD(34) was expressed in 80.0% of lymphoid and 65.2% of myeloid BC. Analysis of the relationship between CD(7) and CD(34) expression in blasts of myeloid crisis showed their dual expression in 8/23 (34.8%) of the cases. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that 14/27 (51.9%) of the patients had developed secondary cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to the Ph chromosome. These newly emerging abnormalities included a trisomy 8 in 3 patients, a double Ph chromosome in 3 patients, an iso chromosome 17q in 2 patients, loss of Y chromosome in 1 patent and other complicated translocation in 5 patients.

METHODS: As bcr-abl fusion gene plays an important role in CML pathology, three single-unit ribozymes were designed and synthesized in 44 base pairs near the fusion point, two enzyme cleavage sites on bcr gene and one on abl gene. Multi-unit ribozymes' in vitro transcription and retroviral vector through gene recombination were constructed. Then, its in vitro cleavage ability was tested and the retroviral vector was transfected into K562 cell. Through MTT assay, the incorporation rate of (3)H-TdR, RT-PCR, Southern and Northern blot hybridization, flow cytometry, transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the effect of multi-unit ribozymes on CML cell proliferation, cell structure, cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: Multi-unit ribozymes had in vitro cleavage efficiency of 70.8%. After the transfection of multi-unit ribozymes retroviral vector into K562 cell, cell proliferation and DNA synthesis were greatly reduced with an inhibition rate of about 50% after 96 hours of transfection. Multi-unit ribozymes could cleave K562 cell's RNA with a reduction rate about one 1 000 th of the original.

Here, we present a representative of a novel class of vitamin D analogs that exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity in a murine model of contact hypersensitivity when applied systemically and is efficacious also at nonhypercalcemic dosages. In vitro analysis revealed a binding affinity of ZK 191784 to the vitamin D receptor comparable with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This compound inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-12 in monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, but with reduced potency and efficacy than 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. Treatment of human monocytes with this analog significantly reduces expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, B7.1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 equipotent to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Interestingly, the compound failed to induce vitamin D-induced differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 to monocytes and was capable of antagonizing the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In vivo, as analyzed in mice the compound potently inhibits the contact hypersensitivity when applied systemically. ZK 191784 has a clear therapeutic advantage over 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by inducing immunosuppressive effects also at concentrations that do not cause hypercalcemia. ZK 191784 is the first representative of a novel class of vitamin D analogs that might have therapeutic potential in T cell-mediated immune disorders.","['Zugel, Ulrich', 'Steinmeyer, Andreas', 'Giesen, Claudia', 'Asadullah, Khusru']","['Zugel U', 'Steinmeyer A', 'Giesen C', 'Asadullah K']","['Research Business Area DermatologyMedicinal Chemistry and Center of Dermatology, Schering AG, 13342 Berlin, Germany. ulrich.zuegel@shering.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (ZK 191784)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dermatitis, Contact/*drug therapy', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*chemically induced', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology']",,2002/12/18 04:00,2003/02/01 04:00,['2002/12/18 04:00'],"['2002/12/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)30094-4 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19623.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2002 Dec;119(6):1434-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19623.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The embryonic beta-globin genes Ey and betaH1 are located in a approximately 30 kb central subdomain characterized by low-level histone acetylation, while the fetal/adult genes betamajor and betaminor and the upstream locus control region reside in hyperacetylated chromatin. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce H4 acetylation at the Ey promoter [Forsberg, E. C., Downs, K. M., Christensen, H. M., Im, H., Nuzzi, P. A., and Bresnick, E. H. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97, 14494-14499], indicating that HDACs maintain low-level H4 acetylation at this site. Since little is known about the establishment of broad histone modification patterns, we asked whether this mechanism applies only to the promoter or to the entire subdomain. We show that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A induces H4 hyperacetylation at multiple sites within the subdomain in erythroid cells. The hematopoietic factors p45/NF-E2, GATA-1, and erythroid kruppel-like factor (EKLF), which function through cis elements of the beta-globin locus, were not required for induction of H4 hyperacetylation. Analysis of chromatin structure within the subdomain revealed low accessibility to restriction endonucleases and nearly complete CpG dinucleotide methylation. Induction of H4 hyperacetylation did not restore hallmark features of transcriptionally active chromatin. We propose that an HDAC-dependent surveillance mechanism counteracts constitutive histone acetyltransferase (HAT) access, thereby maintaining low-level H4 acetylation throughout the subdomain.","['Im, Hogune', 'Grass, Jeffrey A', 'Christensen, Heather M', 'Perkins, Andrew', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Im H', 'Grass JA', 'Christensen HM', 'Perkins A', 'Bresnick EH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Program, University of Wisconsin Medical School, 383 Medical Science Center, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],['DK50107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Globins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/18 04:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/12/18 04:00'],"['2002/12/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['bi026786q [pii]', '10.1021/bi026786q [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2002 Dec 24;41(51):15152-60. doi: 10.1021/bi026786q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matching on known prognostic factors and waiting time to transplant can be used to select appropriate samples for the analysis. When a variable number of patients treated with conventional therapy matches each transplanted patient, the standard estimating and testing procedures need to be modified in order to account for the fact that matched data are highly stratified, with strata containing a few, possibly censored, observations. A weighted version of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which accounts for a variable proportion of matching, is proposed and its statistical properties are studied.

METHODS: The induction of cell death of several human leukemia cell lines cultured in vitro in the presence of serum collected from the brain or the systemic circulation of patients with acute brain injury was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V and propidium iodide. The percentages of apoptotic lymphocytes derived directly from the patients were also quantified. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the induction of cell death, the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, as well as the effect of addition of several molecules known to interfere with apoptosis, was evaluated in the cell cultures. The presence of serum autoantibodies at the time of injury and 6 months later was studied. RESULTS: Systemic serum and, especially, serum draining from the brain lesions induced the in vitro death of the leukemia cell lines used. Moreover, there were higher percentages of ex vivo dead lymphocytes in regional blood than in systemic blood 48 hours after injury. These effects seemed to be induced by an exogenous and/or endogenous opioid, since they were blocked by the opioid antagonist, naloxone. Furthermore, such effects were mediated by an increased expression of Bax. Importantly, apoptotic Jurkat cells were bound to autoantibodies, and patients with acute brain injury produced serum autoantibodies some months after the injury. However, they did not develop a full autoimmune disease at that time. CONCLUSION: Serum factors from acute brain injuries induce cell death, both in vivo and in vitro. Apoptotic cells and, even more so, necrotic cells in acute brain injury are potential sources for autoantigen presentation that may stimulate autoimmune responses.","['Lopez-Escribano, Herminio', 'Minambres, Eduardo', 'Labrador, Moises', 'Bartolome, Maria Jose', 'Lopez-Hoyos, Marcos']","['Lopez-Escribano H', 'Minambres E', 'Labrador M', 'Bartolome MJ', 'Lopez-Hoyos M']","['Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Narcotic Antagonists)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Brain Injuries/*blood', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naloxone/pharmacology', 'Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.10684 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2002 Dec;46(12):3290-300. doi: 10.1002/art.10684.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The connection between DEK and cancer exists at multiple levels: (a) the t(6;9) chromosomal translocation that characterizes a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia cases results in the formation of a DEK-CAN fusion oncoprotein; (b) a fragment of dek cDNA is capable of partially reversing the radiation-sensitive phenotype of fibroblasts cultured from ataxia-telangiectasia patients; and (c) increased levels of dek mRNA have been found to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Despite the growing list of cancer subtypes with a connection to DEK, the factors that mediate its expression have yet to be characterized. Here we undertake the analysis of DEK regulation by mapping the discrete elements within the proximal promoter that are responsible for constitutive transcription of dek in transformed cells. We find that functional elements include an inverted CCAAT box and a YY1 consensus binding site, and the introduction of point mutations into these sites markedly diminishes transcriptional activity. In addition, we identify the transcriptional activator NF-Y as a member of the CCAAT-binding complex, and verify binding of the transcription factor YY1 at its consensus site in the dek promoter. The discovery of NF-Y and YY1 as regulatory determinants of DEK expression is consistent with the well-documented roles of these two factors in cellular proliferation and transformation.","['Sitwala, Kajal V', 'Adams, Kristine', 'Markovitz, David M']","['Sitwala KV', 'Adams K', 'Markovitz DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan, 1150 West Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan, MI 48109-0640, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 36685/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (DEK-CAN fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2002/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1206041 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Dec 12;21(57):8862-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206041.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among members of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, Stat5 is activated by the Bcr-Abl kinase and is implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. We recently identified PD180970 as a new and highly potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase. In this study, we show that blocking Bcr-Abl kinase activity using PD180970 in the human K562 CML cell line resulted in inhibition of Stat5 DNA-binding activity with an IC(50) of 5 nM. Furthermore, abrogation of Abl kinase-mediated Stat5 activation suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells, but not in the Bcr-Abl-negative myeloid cell lines, HEL 92.1.7 and HL-60. Dominant-negative Stat5 protein expressed from a vaccinia virus vector also induced apoptosis of K562 cells, consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated an essential role of Stat5 signaling in growth and survival of CML cells. RNA and protein analyses revealed several candidate target genes of Stat5, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, c-Myc and cyclin D2, which were down-regulated after treatment with PD180970. In addition, PD180970 inhibited Stat5 DNA-binding activity in cultured primary leukemic cells derived from CML patients. To detect activated Stat5 in CML patient specimens, we developed an immunocytochemical assay that can be used as a molecular end-point assay to monitor inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling. Moreover, PD180970 blocked Stat5 signaling and induced apoptosis of STI-571 (Gleevec, Imatinib)-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cells.

Progenitor cell mobilization procedures performed late after diagnosis (>12 months), a short interval between interferon-alpha discontinuation and mobilization (<3.5 months), and an intensive mobilization regimen (idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide, ICE protocol) were associated with a low probability of obtaining 25 metaphases, which was achieved in only 41 instances (25% of the samples). In 38 samples, less than ten metaphases were obtained; a peripheral blood leukocyte count <1.0x10(9)/l at mobilization and mononuclear cell counts in the bag <0.5x10(8)/kg significantly increased the probability to obtain less than ten metaphases for CC analysis. Previous interferon-alpha treatment during > or =12 months and low mononuclear cell counts in the bag (<0.5x10(8)/kg) increased the probability of not obtaining mitosis for cytogenetic analysis. Molecular analysis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique did not give discriminate information in the samples not evaluable by cytogenetics due to the high frequency of PCR-positive results.

Five of the seven known Fanconi anemia proteins bind together in a complex and influence the function of a sixth, FANCD2, which colocalizes with BRCA1 in nuclear foci after genotoxic stress. Carboxy-terminal truncating mutations of the seventh Fanconi anemia gene, BRCA2, are hypomorphic and lead to FA-D1 and possibly FA-B. Because the Fanconi anemia alleles of BRCA2 fail to bind to Rad51 in response to genotoxic stress and Rad51 therefore fails to localize to nuclear damage foci, many investigators in the field suspect that the Fanconi anemia pathway supports the integrity of the Rad51 and BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathways as they function in homologous recombination repair. Because these abnormalities are common to all somatic cells, it is unlikely that dysfunction of this particular pathway results in tissue-specific apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. Indeed, at least one of the Fanconi anemia proteins, FANCC, exhibits functions in hematopoietic cells in addition to its role in the complex. Because FANCC protects hematopoietic cells from apoptotic cues in ways that do not require an intact heteromeric Fanconi anemia complex, it is reasonable to expect that the other Fanconi anemia gene products will have independent cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, particularly in hematopoietic and germ cells that seem to rely so substantially on an intact portfolio of Fanconi anemia proteins.","['Bagby, Grover C Jr']",['Bagby GC Jr'],"['Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland 97201, USA. grover@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],['P01 HL48546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200301000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2003 Jan;10(1):68-76. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200301000-00011.,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no treatment known to produce responses in the great majority of patients in either group. Hence, most patients should be considered for clinical trials. Exceptions are cases with low serum erythropoietin levels or low marrow cellularity; such cases may benefit from erythropoietin with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or antithymocyte globulin, respectively. A wide variety of new agents are in clinical trial. These can be grouped into biologic or targeted, therapies, acute myelogenous leukemia-type chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplants. In general, competing risk-to-benefit ratios and consideration of natural histories suggest that patients with a better prognosis should receive biologic therapies first, with transplant reserved until failure. In higher-risk patients, particularly those who are relatively young or have a normal karyotype, acute myelogenous leukemia-type chemotherapy or transplant should be considered earlier in the course. The advent of nonmyeloablative (mini) transplant protocols has extended to 70 to 75 years the age at which transplantation can be performed, although the efficacy of such protocols is unknown. Current data do not permit recommendation of specific regimens in patients with a better or worse prognosis; rather, emphasis should be placed on entry into a clinical trial Finally, because other causes of cytopenias are more treatable, the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome should depend on more than the presence of dysplasia, unless the dysplasia is very severe.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200301000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2003 Jan;10(1):60-7. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200301000-00010.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cyclic hematopoiesis, neutrophil counts oscillate opposite monocytes in a 3-week cycle. Severe congenital neutropenia consists of static neutropenia and a predisposition to myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia. All cases of cyclic neutropenia and most cases of severe congenital neutropenia result from heterozygous germline mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase, ela2. Recent work extends the list of neutropenia genes to include WASp, Gfi-1, adaptin, and tafazzin. Studies of mosaic patients suggest that ela2 mutations act in a cell-autonomous fashion. A hypothetical feedback circuit potentially interconnects these genes. Genetic dissection of signaling in model organisms along with experimental hematology implicate C/EPBepsilon, RUNX1/AML1, Notch family members, LEF1, and Cdc42 as additional nodes in this pathway. The authors propose that neutrophil elastase acts as an inhibitor of myelopoiesis, substantiating a chalone hypothesis proposed many years ago.","['Horwitz, Marshall', 'Benson, Kathleen F', 'Duan, Zhijun', 'Person, Richard E', 'Wechsler, Jeremy', 'Williams, Kayleen', 'Albani, Dalila', 'Li, Feng-Qian']","['Horwitz M', 'Benson KF', 'Duan Z', 'Person RE', 'Wechsler J', 'Williams K', 'Albani D', 'Li FQ']","['Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195, USA. horwitz@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['DK55820/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*physiology', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Neutropenia/enzymology/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200301000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2003 Jan;10(1):49-54. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200301000-00008.,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein tyrosine kinase deregulation can occur as a consequence of fusion gene formation because of chromosomal translocations, or as distinct gain-of-function point mutations. Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) targeting the ABL protein tyrosine kinase has revolutionized current chronic myeloid leukemia therapy, it became rapidly evident that overcoming the multiple cellular resistance mechanisms will be very challenging. To develop efficient therapeutic alternatives, one must understand the complex signal transduction mechanisms involved in transformation by deregulated protein tyrosine kinases. This article reviews the most recently identified molecular mechanisms involved in cell transformation by the BCR/ABL protein tyrosine kinase fusion and presents new members of the increasing family of deregulated protein tyrosine kinases involved in myeloproliferative disorders.

There are multiple common genetic alterations in childhood acute myeloid leukemia. These include chromosomal translocations affecting RUNX1-CBFbeta, RARalpha, and MLL. There are known activating mutations in the genes for the receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3, KIT, and FMS. As these abnormalities are better understood, they are providing important insights into the pathogenesis of disease as well as information about prognosis. Although intensive chemotherapy remains the mainstay of acute myeloid leukemia therapy, long-term cure rates with chemotherapy alone remain approximately 50%, creating an urgent need for better therapies. Multiple avenues are being explored in the design of new treatments for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Targeted therapies include targeted antibody therapy; inhibitors of FLT3, KIT, and farnesyltransferase; diphtheria toxin conjugated to the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; and antisense oligonucleotides. Another area of interest is chromatin remodeling and differentiation therapy, including agents such as all- retinoic acid, arsenic trioxide, and inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation.

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured before BMT, and 1, 2, and 3 yr after BMT. Serum markers of bone turnover were serially measured before BMT and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 yr after BMT. The mean change in the lumbar spine (L2-4) BMD, calculated as the percent change from the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -4.7% (NS), -1.1% (NS), and +6.4% (p<0.05), respectively. The mean change in the total proximal femur BMD from the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -8.5% (p<0.01), -8.7% (p<0.05) and -5.6% (p<0.05), respectively. In summary, there was little decline in lumbar BMD at 1 yr following BMT and gradual recovery until 3 yr. In contrast, femoral BMD decreased much more than the lumbar area at 1 yr and did not recover until 3 yr. The mechanism of skeletal site-selective differences in the changes of BMD needs to be elucidated.","['Lee, Won Young', 'Kang, Moo Il', 'Baek, Ki Hyun', 'Oh, Eun Sook', 'Oh, Ki Won', 'Lee, Kwang Woo', 'Kim, Sun Woo', 'Kim, Choon Choo']","['Lee WY', 'Kang MI', 'Baek KH', 'Oh ES', 'Oh KW', 'Lee KW', 'Kim SW', 'Kim CC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. drlwy@samsung.co.kr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Collagen/blood', 'Collagen Type I', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Peptides/blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",PMC3054966,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['200212749 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2002.17.6.749 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2002 Dec;17(6):749-54. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2002.17.6.749.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that for three genes (P16, MLH1, and the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene, MGMT), histone H3 Lys-9 methylation directly correlates and histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation inversely correlates with DNA methylation in three neoplastic cell lines. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in moderately increased Lys-9 acetylation at silenced loci with no effect on Lys-9 methylation and minimal effects on gene expression. By contrast, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC) rapidly reduced Lys-9 methylation at silenced loci and resulted in reactivation for all three genes. Combined treatment with 5Aza-dC and TSA was synergistic in reactivating gene expression through simultaneous effects on Lys-9 methylation and acetylation, which resulted in a robust increase in the ratio of Lys-9 acetylated and methylated histones at loci showing dense DNA methylation. By contrast to Lys-9, histone H3 Lys-4 methylation inversely correlated with promoter DNA methylation, was not affected by TSA, and was increased moderately at silenced loci by 5Aza-dC. Our results suggest that reduced H3 Lys-4 methylation and increased H3 Lys-9 methylation play a critical role in the maintenance of promoter DNA methylation-associated gene silencing in colorectal cancer.","['Kondo, Yutaka', 'Shen, LanLan', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Kondo Y', 'Shen L', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Chromosome translocations in human leukemia disrupt MLL (11q23), generating chimeric proteins between the N terminus of MLL and multiple translocation partners. Here we report that MLL is normally cleaved at two conserved sites (D/GADD and D/GVDD) and that mutation of these sites abolishes the proteolysis. MLL cleavage generates N-terminal p320 (N320) and C-terminal p180 (C180) fragments, which form a stable complex that localizes to a subnuclear compartment. The FYRN domain of N320 directly interacts with the FYRC and SET domains of C180. Disrupting the interaction between N320 and C180 leads to a marked decrease in the level of N320 and a redistribution of C180 to a diffuse nuclear pattern. These data suggest a model in which a dynamic post-cleavage association confers stability to N320 and correct nuclear sublocalization of the complex, to control the availability of N320 for target genes. This predicts that MLL fusion proteins of leukemia which would lose the ability to complex with C180 have their stability conferred instead by the fusion partners, thus providing one mechanism for altered target gene expression.","['Hsieh, James J-D', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye', 'Tempst, Paul', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J']","['Hsieh JJ', 'Ernst P', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Tempst P', 'Korsmeyer SJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",PMC140678,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.1.186-194.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Jan;23(1):186-94. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.1.186-194.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AF10 has been identified as a fusion partner of both MLL and CALM in infant leukemias. Both fusion proteins retain the leucine zipper domain of AF10 but not its PHD domain. We show here that, while the full-length ALH protein has no activity on Polycomb group-responsive elements (PREs), overexpression of the isolated ALH leucine zipper domain activates several PREs. Within the ALH full-length protein, the PHD domain inhibits the PRE deregulation mediated by the leucine zipper domain. This deregulation is conserved in the human AF10 leucine zipper domain, which confers the same activity on an oncogenic MLL-AF10 fusion protein expressed in Drosophila melanogaster. These data reveal new properties for the leucine zipper domain and thus might provide new clues to understanding the mechanisms by which AF10 fusion proteins in which the PHD domain is lost might trigger leukemias in humans.","['Perrin, Laurent', 'Bloyer, Sebastien', 'Ferraz, Conchita', 'Agrawal, Namita', 'Sinha, Pradip', 'Dura, Jean Maurice']","['Perrin L', 'Bloyer S', 'Ferraz C', 'Agrawal N', 'Sinha P', 'Dura JM']","['Institut de Genetique Humaine, CNRS, UPR 1142, 34396 Montpellier Cedex 5, France. perrin@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Alh protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF10 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (MLLT6 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pc protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Response Elements', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC140655,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.1.119-130.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Jan;23(1):119-30. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.1.119-130.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF217960'],,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we measured telomere lengths in granulocytes and T lymphocytes from patients with MPDs and compared them with those from normal individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Granulocytes and T lymphocytes were separated from the peripheral blood of 65 patients with MPDs (25 chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], 16 polycythemia vera, 19 essential thrombocythemia, 5 chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis) and 35 normal individuals. Genomic DNA from each cell fraction was subjected to Southern blot hybridization to determine the mean telomere length. RESULTS: Telomere lengths in granulocytes from patients with MPDs were significantly shorter than those from normal individuals (vs CML, p = 0.002; vs other MPDs, p < 0.0001). However, there was no statistical difference in telomere length in T lymphocytes between MPD patients and normal individuals (vs CML, p = 0.35; vs other MPDs, p = 0.85). DeltaTRF (terminal restriction fragment) in patients with MPDs, which is defined as the difference in telomere length between granulocytes and T lymphocytes, was significantly longer than that in normal individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the disease theory that MPDs result from extensive proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, leading to accelerated telomere length shortening in mature granulocytes. An increase in DeltaTRF over the standard value (>1.74 kb) may be useful for discriminating leukocytosis due to MPDs from reactive leukocytosis.","['Terasaki, Yasushi', 'Okumura, Hirokazu', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Terasaki Y', 'Okumura H', 'Ohtake S', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods/standards', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Telomere/metabolism/*ultrastructure']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02009694 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00969-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Dec;30(12):1399-404. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00969-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a novel splice variant of FGFR2 (FGFR2AT-I) arising from skipping exons 7-10 in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, encoding a FGFR2 in which the Ig-like-III domain is deleted while the remainder of the mature molecule is fused in-frame to the transmembrane and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic kinases. Binding assays demonstrated that the FGFR2AT-I was able to bind FGF1, FGF2, and FGF7, leading to loss of ligand binding specificity. Furthermore, overexpression of FGFR2AT-I resulted in increased AKT and MAPK activation, conferring a survival advantage. Taken together, these findings indicate that the dysregulation of FGFRs' function by aberrant mRNA splicing contributes to tumor progression.","['Jang, Jun-Hyeog', 'Chung, Chong-Pyoung']","['Jang JH', 'Chung CP']","['Intellectual Biointerface Engineering Center, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-768, Korea. juhjang@seoul.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Exons', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602905486 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0548 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Jul-Aug;29(1):133-7. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0548.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most genomic imbalances were not specific for drug resistance, as they were found in both parental and drug-resistant lines. Three aberrations were common to all or most cell lines analyzed: dim(5q35), dim(9p21p24), and enh(20q). We were concerned on those imbalances which were specifically present in drug-resistant but not in drug-sensitive cells. All methotrexate-resistant cell lines were characterized by an enhancement or an amplification of 5q13. The methotrexate resistance-conferring dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene is located at this locus. Gain of DHFR was verified by PCR analyses. CEM/MTX60PGA, CEM/MTX140LV, CEM/MTX1500LV, and CEM/MTX5000PGA showed enh(14q21qter) and CEM/MTX5000PGA amp(5p13p15.2). These two loci harbor the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) and 5'-methyltetrahdrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) genes, both of which are involved in folate metabolism. Their gain indicates a role in methotrexate resistance. A loss of 4q35 was found in CEM/MTXR2, CEM/MTXR3, and CEM/ADR5000 where the proapoptotic caspase-3 gene is located. The thioredoxin (TXN) locus 9q31 was enhanced in CEM/ADR5000 and CEM/MTX5000PGA cells. 2p22pter was increased in hydroxyurea-resistant CEM/HUR90 cells. Ribonucleotide reductase polypeptide M2 (RRM2), which confers resistance to hydroxyurea, resides at this locus. Other specific genomic imbalances in drug-resistant cell lines were dim(1p36.5), enh(4p), dim(8p22pter), enh(12p13), dim(17p), enh(18q12), enh(21q22.2), dim(21q22.2), and dim(22q13). All genomic imbalances were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and clustered image mapping to identify profiles of chromosomal aberrations in the cell lines. The obtained dendrograms allowed separation of imbalances common to all or most cell lines from other more individual aberrations. Furthermore, methotrexate-resistant cell lines clustered together. Our future efforts will be directed toward those imbalances which implicate still unknown candidate drug resistance genes.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Verdorfer, Irmgard', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Sauerbrey, Axel', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Chitambar, Christopher R', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Gebhart, Erich']","['Efferth T', 'Verdorfer I', 'Miyachi H', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Drexler HG', 'Chitambar CR', 'Haber M', 'Gebhart E']","['Virtual Campus Rhineland-Palatinate, P.O.

Furthermore, the reduction in Bcl-2 expression led to an increase in apoptotic cell death that was associated with an increase in Bax expression. In this present study antisense oligonucleotides directed towards the Bax translation initiation sequence were employed to determine whether Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression were interdependent upon one another and whether Bcl-2 antisense-induced apoptosis was mediated through a p53-dependent cell death pathway. The antisense oligonucleotide down-regulated Bax protein expression between 23.7 and 68.8% in the 20 B-CLL samples tested and significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death when compared to controls (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, these changes were independent of Bcl-2 expression suggesting that the previously observed increase in Bax expression following exposure of B-CLL cells to Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides was probably caused by the induction of apoptosis rather than a rheostatic response to the reduction in Bcl-2 protein expression. This notion was substantiated by the fact that p21 expression was induced in Bcl-2 antisense-treated B-CLL cells, a finding consistent with p53 activation.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Bentley, Paul']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penlan Road, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, CF64 2XX, UK. chrisp@llanhaem.demon.co.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000015961 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Oct;43(10):2003-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000015961.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two different batches of vineatrol (vineatrol 10 and 25%) was obtained by HPLC fractionation and contained 10 and 25% trans-resveratrol, respectively. The different polyphenols were added to cultures of leukemic cells from chronic B cell malignancies (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-CLL or hairy cell leukemia, HCL) or normal peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMC) as a control. The different polyphenols displayed anti-proliferative effect on the leukemic cells, as estimated by the observed inhibition of tritiated thymidine uptake and the reduction of cell recovery. Vineatrol 10% was the most potent whereas vineatrol 25% and resveratrol displayed comparable activity, epsilon-viniferin only exhibiting slight effets. The same order of potency was observed for their capacity to induce apoptosis in leukemic B cells. In contrast, the survival of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was little affected in the presence of these polyphenolic compounds and higher concentrations were required in order to elicit cell death. Polyphenol-driven apoptosis in chronic leukemic B cells was shown to correlate with an activation of caspase 3, a drop in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, a reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, as well as a reduction in the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

To investigate whether repeat nucleotide repeat expansion is a feature of CLL, the repeat expansion detection (RED) technique was applied to samples from 17 patients with familial disease and 32 patients with early-onset CLL disease.

Patients with the following diagnoses/characteristics were treated with 1-3 infusions of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a dose of 9 mg/m2: (1) relapse of AML < or = 6 months of first complete remission (CR); (2) AML refractory to chemotherapy at initial induction or at first relapse; (3) AML in second or greater relapse; (4) myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); (5) untreated patients > or = 70 years or > or = 55 years with abnormal cytogenetics (excluding inv 16, t(15;17) and t(8;21)) and/or an antecedent hematologic disorder; (6) refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBT). Forty-three patients, ages 19-84 (mean 62), were treated, including 7 patients with untreated AML age > 70 years, 2 with untreated RAEBT, 14 with AML first salvage (first remission 0-6 months), 15 with AML > or = second salvage and 14 with myeloid blast phase of CML. The overall response rate was 14%, with 4/43 (9%) patients achieving CR and 2/43 (5%) achieving CR without platelet recovery. The most significant toxicity was neutropenic fever, which occurred in 84% of patients. In conclusion, in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, gemtuzumab ozogamicin has a comparable response rate to single-agent chemotherapy and may offer a more favorable toxicity profile.","['Roboz, G J', 'Knovich, M A', 'Bayer, R L', 'Schuster, M W', 'Seiter, K', 'Powell, B L', 'Woodruff, R D', 'Silver, R T', 'Frankel, A E', 'Feldman, E J']","['Roboz GJ', 'Knovich MA', 'Bayer RL', 'Schuster MW', 'Seiter K', 'Powell BL', 'Woodruff RD', 'Silver RT', 'Frankel AE', 'Feldman EJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University and The New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10021, USA. gar2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000016078 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Oct;43(10):1951-5. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000016078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen patients under 21 years old were given infusions of gemcitabine for escalating durations at 10 mg/m2/min weekly for three consecutive weeks. Two males and two females were studied at each dose level. Pharmacokinetics of the drug's metabolism were measured by high pressure-liquid chromatography (HPLC) for 24 h after the first dose. Intracellular difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate formation in leukemic blasts was measured in selected patients. The MTD of gemcitabine in these patients was 3600 mg/m2/week for three consecutive weeks (10 mg/m2/min for 360 min). Hepatotoxicity was the dose limiting toxicity. Thirty to fifty percent of patients exhibited fever, rash, or myalgia. Rare instances of hypotension and pulmonary toxicity were observed. Two of six patients [one acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and one acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)] treated at the MTD had at least M2 marrows, although peripheral blood counts did not recover sufficiently for the patients to be considered in complete response. Pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine fit a two-compartment open model with terminal half-life and plasma clearance value of 62 min and 2.2 l/min/m2, respectively. No gender differences were observed. In conclusion, the MTD of gemcitabine was 10 mg/m2/min for 360 min every week for 3 weeks. This is the recommended phase II dose schedule for children with leukemia. The activity of the drug at this schedule in heavily pretreated, refractory patients warrants a phase II trial in hematologic malignancies.","['Steinherz, P G', 'Seibel, N L', 'Ames, M M', 'Avramis, V I', 'Krailo, M D', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Reid, J M', 'Safgren, S L', 'Reaman, G H']","['Steinherz PG', 'Seibel NL', 'Ames MM', 'Avramis VI', 'Krailo MD', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Reid JM', 'Safgren SL', 'Reaman GH']",['steinhep@mskcc.org'],['eng'],['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biotransformation', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxycytidine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000015880 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Oct;43(10):1945-50. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000015880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a total of 271 children undergoing ALL/NHL or relapsed ALL treatment according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocols, drug monitoring of ASNase serum activity was performed after PEG-ASNase infusions. From December 1996 to July 2000, 1667 samples after 362 intravenous administrations of either 500, 750, 1000 or 2500 IU/m2 PEG-ASNase were analyzed. Three weeks after infusion when relating the ASNase activity to the four-dose levels significant differences were not observed. Large interpatient variability was seen at each dose level resulting in a relevant number of patients not achieving adequate treatment intensity. Neither the extent of ASNase pre-treatment nor a prior event of a hypersensitivity reaction against unmodified ASNase had any impact on PEG-ASNase pharmacokinetics. It is concluded that escalation of the dose of PEG-ASNase did not result in a significant prolongation of time with activity values considered therapeutic. Depending on the desired endpoint, a second administration of PEG-ASNase seems to be more favorable than increasing the dose. For a safer recommendation, further investigations assessing the pharmacodynamic profile are required. Drug monitoring is advisable for early detection of patients with rapid elimination in order to ensure maximum treatment intensity.","['Vieira Pinheiro, J P', 'Lanversa, C', 'Wurthwein, G', 'Beier, R', 'Casimiro da Palma, J', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Boos, J']","['Vieira Pinheiro JP', 'Lanversa C', 'Wurthwein G', 'Beier R', 'Casimiro da Palma J', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Boos J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, 48129 Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000015853 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Oct;43(10):1911-20. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000015853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth of FDC(WTKit) was inhibited by Imatinib with GI50 (a concentration of drug at which 50% inhibition of growth occurs) of 0.1-0.2 microM but FDC(V560GKit) were more sensitive to Imatinib with a GI50 of 0.01-0.025 microM and FDC(D816VKit) were resistant to Imatinib with a GI50 greater than 5 microM. The naturally occurring isoforms of c-Kit did not differ in their sensitivity to Imatinib. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated that 1 microM Imatinib reduced phosphorylation of WTKit and completely blocked phosphorylation of V560GKit but did not affect D816VKit phosphorylation. In signaling studies, addition of stem cell factor (SCF) induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt by WTKit, and ERK, Akt and STAT3 by V560GKit, which were all blocked by Imatinib. Imatinib also blocked the constitutive activation of Akt and STAT3 by V560GKit but had no affect on the constitutive activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 by D816VKit. Overall, these findings demonstrate the increased susceptibility of the Kit juxtamembrane mutant, V560G, and the resistance of the kinase domain mutant, D816V, to Imatinib compared with WTKit.","['Frost, Michelle J', 'Ferrao, Petranel T', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Ashman, Leonie K']","['Frost MJ', 'Ferrao PT', 'Hughes TP', 'Ashman LK']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Newcastle, Room 511, Medical Sciences Building, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 Oct;1(12):1115-24.,,,,,['Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Nov;10(11):2032-3.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that blockade of either the 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) or 12-LOX pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms for LOX inhibitor-induced apoptosis and the potential of LOX inhibitors as antipancreatic cancer agents using the athymic mice xenograft model. Apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells induced by LOX inhibitors (including the nonselective LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid, the 5-LOX inhibitor Rev-5901, and the 12-LOX inhibitor baicalein) was confirmed by growth inhibition, annexin V binding, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay in MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells. Expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 was significantly decreased after LOX inhibitor treatment while that of the proapoptotic protein bax was increased. LOX inhibitors also markedly induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Caspase-9, caspase-7, and caspase-3 but not caspase-8 were activated after treatment, concomitant with cleavage of the capase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In vivo studies in the athymic mice xenograft model also confirmed the growth inhibitory effect and induction of apoptosis by these LOX inhibitors in pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, LOX inhibitors block pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway both in vivo and in vitro. LOX inhibitors are likely to be valuable for the treatment of human pancreatic cancer.","['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Ding, Xian-Zhong', 'Witt, Richard C', 'Adrian, Thomas E']","['Tong WG', 'Ding XZ', 'Witt RC', 'Adrian TE']","['Gastrointestinal Oncology Laboratories, Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Medical School, Tarry 4-711, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['P50 CA72712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolines)', '101910-24-1 (alpha-pentyl-3-(2-quinolinylmethoxy)benzenemethanol)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lipoxygenase/*pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 Sep;1(11):929-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG-490, selectively blocks JAK activity and completely eliminates leukemia cells in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. Because many cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-12, have been shown to signal through JAK/STAT pathways, AG-490 may inhibit cytokine-based cancer therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of AG-490 on IL-12 functional signaling and IL-12-mediated antitumor response in vivo. Previous studies have established the critical roles of macrophages and IFN-gamma in mediating IL-12-induced antitumor effects. Our results show that in vivo administration of AG-490 causes tumor cell apoptosis but does not inhibit IL-12-mediated macrophage activation and IFN-gamma production by lymphocytes. Furthermore, our data indicate that combined therapy with AG-490 and IL-12-induces greater antitumor effects than either agent alone in a murine myeloma tumor model.

MAIN POINTS: IFN is a cytokine involved in cellular immunity, that promotes both differentiation of dendritic cells and the TH1 pathway. Auto-immune side-effects of recombinant IFN depend on IFN dosage and the pathology concerned. The spectrum extends from occurrence of auto-antibodies in an asymptomatic patient to overt disease such as systemic lupus. Antigenic targets of auto-antibodies are diverse: blood cells coagulation factors, immunoglobulin, hormones, intrinsic factor, intracellular components. Thyroiditis is the most frequently reported auto-immune disease occurring during IFN treatment, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or a bi-phasic pattern. Currently, true incidence of thyroiditis remains debated. It appears very low (under 1%) in hepatologic series using low-dose IFN. The fact that auto-immunity may be related to the treated disease--before use of IFN--must also be addressed: e.g. antinuclear factors and anti-DNA antibodies in chronic myeloid leukemia or anti-actin and anti-LKM antibodies in chronic C hepatitis. FUTURE PROSPECTS: Recombinant alpha interferon appears more as a trigger than a de novo inducer of auto-immune disorders. Its use as an immunomodulator agent should be treated with caution.","['Papo, T']",['Papo T'],"['Service de medecine interne, hopital Bichat, 46, rue Henri-Huchard, 75877 Paris, France. thomas.papo@bch.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/03 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0248-8663(02)00666-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(02)00666-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2002 Nov;23 Suppl 4:501s-510s. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(02)00666-5.,,,108,,,,,,,,,Interferon alpha et auto-immunite.,,,,

IFN alpha are a family of polypeptides produced by eukaryote cells in response to various stimulant agents. The first trials using this cytokine in humans were carried out by H. Strander in the years 1965-1970. IFN alpha contain anti-viral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties. The access of clinicians to IFN alpha molecules, in addition to elements produced by genetic engineering for approximately the past 20 years, has permitted a number of therapeutic trials to be carried out. In hematology the clinical interest of IFN alpha was primarily in chronic myeloid and lymphoid proliferating syndromes. Certain indications have to date been well demonstrated. However, the impact of IFN alpha on therapeutic care of certain hemopathies as compared to conventional treatment remains controversial. At the same time, the frequency of side effects from treatment with IFN alpha and its cost should be taken into consideration. CURRENT POSITION AND MAJOR POINTS: The therapeutic trials carried out over the past ten years have proven the interest of IFN alpha in, essentially, two diseases: on one hand chronic myeloid leukemia with the acquisition of cytogenetic remission and on the other malignant non-Hodgkin's follicular type lymphoma. However, as regards other hemopathies the place of IFN alpha remains debatable. PERSPECTIVES: The future of IFN alpha use in the treatment of hemopathies appears to be linked to its association with new treatments, an association, however, where its efficacy and superiority should be demonstrated. This is the case in chronic myeloid leukemia where IFN alpha could be associated with aracytine or the inhibitors of tyrosine kinase. Also, in the treatment of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas as well as the studies concerning the association between IFN alpha and monoclonal antibodies, in particular antibody anti-CD 20.","['Lacotte-Thierry, L', 'Guilhot, F']","['Lacotte-Thierry L', 'Guilhot F']","[""Service d'oncologie hematologique et de therapie cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, rue de la Miletrie, 86021 Poitiers, France. l.lacotte@chu-poitiers.fr""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy']",,2002/12/17 04:00,2003/01/03 04:00,['2002/12/17 04:00'],"['2002/12/17 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0248-8663(02)00662-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(02)00662-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2002 Nov;23 Suppl 4:481s-488s. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(02)00662-8.,,,47,,,,,,,,,Interferon et hematologie.,,,,

Because of severe fever the patient was hospitalized. Waldeyer's throat ring revealed signs of acute inflammation. LABORATORY FINDINGS: Indicated severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. Leucocytes were 8000/ml with a pathological shift to the left (1920/ml blasts). CRP (4.7 g/dl) and BSG (59/91mm) were abnormal. An axial CT of the neck showed a left sided paratonsillar abscess. DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY: The tonsillitis was treated with antibiotics. Persistent fever up to 39.8 degrees C suggested resistance to therapy. After three weeks the patient developed septicemia and died. Autopsy revealed MDS with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBT-t). Granulocytic sarcoma was found in the throating where there was no paratonsillar abscess. Generalized miliary tuberculosis was proved at autopsy, explaining the continuous fever resistant to antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: Granulocytic sarcoma is rarely associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.

However secondary chromosomal aberrations are also extremely common. Of these, 8q24 abnormalities associated with the t(11;14) are rare. Over the course of 10 years at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, we identified five cases of mantle cell lymphoma in which conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed complex karyotypes, including the t(11;14) and 8q24 abnormalities: one with t(8;14)(q24;q32), one with t(2;8)(q13;q24), and three with add(8)(q24). We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on all cases. In the case with the t(8;14), IgH/myc fusion signals were identified, and in the case with the t(2;8), split c-myc signals were detected. In the three cases with add(8)(q24), one case had split c-myc signals and two cases had three copies of c-myc. Thus, the c-myc gene was involved in all cases. All five neoplasms had blastoid morphologic features, and four cases, including the cases with the t(8;14) and t(2;8), had leukemic involvement. We conclude that 8q24 abnormalities involving the c-myc gene are uncommon secondary abnormalities that occur in a subset of mantle cell lymphomas. C-myc gene abnormalities are associated with blastoid cytologic features and also may be associated with leukemic involvement.","['Hao, Suyang', 'Sanger, Warren', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Schlette, Ellen J', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Hao S', 'Sanger W', 'Onciu M', 'Lai R', 'Schlette EJ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Antigens, CD', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialoglycoproteins/analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.MP.0000037310.82136.99 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2002 Dec;15(12):1266-72. doi: 10.1097/01.MP.0000037310.82136.99.,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that human plasma activated AKT and potently blocked the ability of chlorambucil or gamma radiation to induce apoptosis of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Here we report experiments that identify albumin as the major component of plasma that blocks CLL cell killing by chlorambucil or radiation. Intact plasma depleted of albumin by chromatography on Cibacron blue-Sepharose or plasma from a subject with analbuminemia failed either to activate AKT or to protect CLL cells from chlorambucil-induced apoptosis. Both functions were restored by re-addition of albumin. The protective action of albumin as well as AKT activation was compromised by the binding of lipids. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan) analysis demonstrated the uptake of fluoresceinated albumin by CLL cells. Accumulation of albumin in intracellular vesicles was also shown by confocal microscopy. Indirect inhibition of AKT activation by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 reversed the blockade of chlorambucil-induced killing by plasma albumin. The data suggest that activation of AKT consequent to binding of albumin by CLL cells blocks chlorambucil- and radiation-induced apoptosis. Strategies designed to block albumin-induced antiapoptotic signaling may, therefore, be of value in enhancing cytotoxic drug action on CLL cells.","['Jones, Dylan T', 'Ganeshaguru, Kanagasabai', 'Anderson, Robert J', 'Jackson, Trevor R', 'Bruckdorfer, K Richard', 'Low, Sylvia Y', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Prentice, H Grant', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Mehta, Atul B', 'Wickremasinghe, R Gitendra']","['Jones DT', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Anderson RJ', 'Jackson TR', 'Bruckdorfer KR', 'Low SY', 'Palmqvist L', 'Prentice HG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Mehta AB', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2143 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50818-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3174-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2143.

We demonstrate the efficient and specific suppression of AML1/MTG8 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in the human leukemic cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1. siRNAs targeted against the fusion site of the AML1/MTG8 mRNA reduce the levels of AML1/MTG8 without affecting the amount of wild-type AML1. These data argue against a transitive RNA interference mechanism potentially induced by siRNAs in such leukemic cells. Depletion of AML1/MTG8 correlates with an increased susceptibility of both Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells to tumor growth factor beta(1) (TGF beta(1))/vitamin D(3)-induced differentiation, leading to increased expression of CD11b, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, and C/EBP alpha (CAAT/enhancer binding protein). Moreover, siRNA-mediated AML1/MTG8 suppression results in changes in cell shape and, in combination with TGF beta(1)/vitamin D(3), severely reduces clonogenicity of Kasumi-1 cells. These results suggest an important role for AML1/MTG8 in preventing differentiation, thereby propagating leukemic blast cells. Therefore, siRNAs are promising tools for a functional analysis of AML1/MTG8 and may be used in a molecularly defined therapeutic approach for t(8;21)-positive leukemia.","['Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Riehle, Heidemarie', 'Hadwiger, Philipp', 'John, Matthias', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Vornlocher, Hans-Peter', 'Nordheim, Alfred']","['Heidenreich O', 'Krauter J', 'Riehle H', 'Hadwiger P', 'John M', 'Heil G', 'Vornlocher HP', 'Nordheim A']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. olaf.heidenreich@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1589 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50816-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3157-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1589.

We examined the role of ABC7 in the biosynthesis of heme in erythroid cells where hemoglobin is a major product of iron-containing compounds. RNA blots showed that the amount of ABC7 mRNA in dimethylsulfoxide (Me(2)SO)-treated mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells increased markedly in parallel with the induction of the mRNA expression of ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in the pathway to synthesize heme. The transfection of the antisense oligonucleotide to mouse ABC7 mRNA into Me(2)SO-treated MEL cells led to a decrease of heme production, as compared with sense oligonucleotide-transfected cells. ABC7 protein was shown to be colocalized with ferrochelatase in mitochondria, as assessed by immunostaining. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo pull-down assays revealed that ABC7 protein is interacted with the carboxy-terminal region containing the iron-sulfur cluster of ferrochelatase. The transient expression of ABC7 in mouse embryo liver BNL-CL2 cells resulted in an increase in the activity and level of ferrochelatase and thioredoxin, a cytosolic protein containing iron-sulfur. These increases were also observed in MEL cells stably expressing ABC7. When ABC7 transfectants were treated with Me(2)SO, an increase in cellular heme concomitant with a marked induction of the expression of ferrochelatase was observed. The extent of these increases was 3-fold greater than in control cells. The results indicated that ABC7 positively regulates not only the expression of extramitochondrial thioredoxin but also that of an intramitochondrial iron-sulfur-containing protein, ferrochelatase. Then, the expression of ABC7 contributes to the production of heme during the differentiation of erythroid cells.","['Taketani, Shigeru', 'Kakimoto, Kazuhiro', 'Ueta, Hiromi', 'Masaki, Ryuichi', 'Furukawa, Takako']","['Taketani S', 'Kakimoto K', 'Ueta H', 'Masaki R', 'Furukawa T']","['Department of Biotechnology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan. taketani@ipc.kit.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABCB7 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Ferrochelatase/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heme/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1212 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50831-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3274-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1212.

In 25 of 27 controls, cells with a TLGL phenotype occurred at low (1%-3%) frequencies. However, in the other 2 individuals (ages 28-36 years), large stable (> 3 years) monoclonal expansions of CD3(+)CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CD27(-)CD57(+)CD94(+) NKG2C(+) were found which rendered these controls phenotypically indistinguishable from TLGL leukemia patients. We believe that the TLGL clonopathy, rather than being of a neoplastic nature, is more likely an extreme manifestation of the large and stable clonal size characteristic of CD8(+) effector cells. Such a TLGL clone consisting of cells without any particular pathologic trait might exist in a considerable number of individuals. Clinical symptoms may occur in individuals in whom the TLGL clone encounters antigen and is triggered to produce large amounts of effector molecules that dysregulate the immune system, which could manifest itself as autoimmunity or as a FasL-mediated neutropenia.","['Bigouret, Valerie', 'Hoffmann, Till', 'Arlettaz, Lionel', 'Villard, Jean', 'Colonna, Marco', 'Ticheli, Andre', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Samii, Kaveh', 'Chapuis, Bernard', 'Rufer, Nathalie', 'Roosnek, Eddy']","['Bigouret V', 'Hoffmann T', 'Arlettaz L', 'Villard J', 'Colonna M', 'Ticheli A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Samii K', 'Chapuis B', 'Rufer N', 'Roosnek E']","['Division of Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD57 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins, C-Type/*analysis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Telomere/ultrastructure']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2408 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50821-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3198-204. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2408.

Biased usage of the V1-69 gene is found in unmutated cases and is combined with selected D gene segments and J(H)6. It is controversial whether this is a CLL-associated feature or mirrors the normal B-cell pattern. Since CLL is a disease of the elderly, where changes in the B-cell repertoire may occur, we have analyzed V1-69 usage in the elderly (older than 75 years) population. Using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) G6, specific for 51p1-related V1-69 alleles, we found no increased expression with age. In 51p1-encoded immunoglobulin M (IgM), complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length and frequency of D and J(H) genes were similar to those in the healthy young and distinct from those in CLL.

The data show that cell viability decreased after treatment and IC(50) value was approximately 2 micro M for RVC-588. Cell differentiation was analyzed with cytofluorometry by changes in expression of glicoprotein surface markers CD11b/Mac-1, CD11c and CD14 together with morphological analysis. A maximum level of expression changes was determined at 72h but these changes were not statistically significant to show the differentiation of HL-60 cells to mature myeloid and/or monocytoid cells. Apoptotic DNA degradation was evaluated and quantitated using sensitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant (ELISA) method. Using this technique, a maximum level of apoptosis 1.2-fold higher than control was observed in cultures exposed for 48h to 2 micro M RVC-588. The DNA ladder assay was subsequently used to determine DNA breaks qualitatively. After 24h, the cells exposed to 2 micro M RVC-588 was shown to have cytotoxic-late apoptotic ladder pattern compared to control cells. These data demonstrate that RVC-588 has a high cytotoxic and antitumor activity in HL-60 cells among other chemicals we synthesized. Although the mechanism by which RVC-588 initiated cell death in these cells is presently not known and apoptotic mechanisms are likely to play less role compared to other chalcone analogues reported previously.","['Saydam, Guray', 'Aydin, H Hakan', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Kucukoglu, Ozlem', 'Erciyas, Ercin', 'Terzioglu, Ender', 'Buyukkececi, Filiz', 'Omay, Serdar Bedii']","['Saydam G', 'Aydin HH', 'Sahin F', 'Kucukoglu O', 'Erciyas E', 'Terzioglu E', 'Buyukkececi F', 'Omay SB']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (4-(2-(p-hydroxybenzoyl)vinyl)phenyl nicotinate)', '0 (4-hydroxy-3-(dimethylaminomethyl)acetophenone)', ""0 (5,3'-dimethylaminomethylchalcone)"", '0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Nicotinic Acids)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)', ""CKY3J88Z94 (4,4'-dihydroxychalcone)""]",IM,"['Acetophenones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylidene Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chalcone/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Chalcones', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nicotinic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/03/04 04:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000589 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00058-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Jan;27(1):57-64. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00058-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified hMSH2 mutations in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patient tumor samples and others have reported coding region microsatellite mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. Thus, while MMR gene mutations are known to occur in some human T-lymphoblastic tumors in vivo, it is still unknown if the coding region microsatellite mutations detected in human cell lines also occur in vivo or if hMLH1 or hMSH2 promoter hypermethylation contributes to defective MMR in these tumors. We analyzed the TGFbetaRII (A)10 and caspase-5 (A)10 coding region repeats in 16 human T-LBL/ALL patient tumor samples and identified six with microsatellite mutations in one or both repeats. There was no evidence of hMSH2 or hMLH1 promoter methylation as assessed by standard methylation specific PCR or by a novel temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) method that analyzed 25 and 30 CpG sites in the hMLH1 and hMSH2 promoters, respectively. Our results indicate that coding region microsatellite mutations characteristic of defective MMR occur in some human T-LBL/ALL in vivo but not as a consequence of hMLH1 or hMSH2 promoter hypermethylation.

This study was performed to determine the effect of short-course high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) treatment on the peripheral blood (PB) T lymphocyte subsets, and blast cells, during remission induction treatment in 23 children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (16 with ALL, seven with AML). All patients were administered HDMP as a single daily oral dose of 30mg/kg for the first 4 days of induction therapy. The number of PB lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16+56, CD45RA, and CD45RO) were determined by flow cytometry before and after 4 days of HDMP treatment. While the number of PB blast cells significantly decreased, the absolute number of T lymphocytes expressing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA and the absolute number of CD16+56 (natural killer) cells increased in all patients. We suggest that the beneficial effects of HDMP in the induction treatment of acute leukemia may occur partly due to an increase in the number of PB T lymphocyte subsets.

Misconceptions about prognosis and treatment contribute to the undertreatment of elderly cancer patients and consequent poor outcomes. Although older patients have been excluded from cancer treatment trials in the past, response rates to chemotherapy in a variety of common cancers in otherwise healthy elderly patients are comparable to those attained in younger patients. Lower functional reserve in many organ systems alters the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs as well as the patient's response to treatment-induced toxicity. Except for myelosuppression and mucositis, otherwise fit elderly cancer patients are not at significantly enhanced risk of toxicity to chemotherapy. Severe neutropenia and related infection are encountered much more frequently during the treatment of elderly as compared with younger cancer patients. These lead to treatment delays, dose reductions and higher hospitalisation rates. Myelopoietic growth factor support reduces myelosuppression and the associated risk of severe infection, thereby allowing delivery of chemotherapy at full dose intensity. Beneficial responses to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) in elderly patients have been found in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) therapy and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) during induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; sargramostim) has been found to reduce myelosuppression in elderly AML patients receiving induction but not consolidation chemotherapy. These prophylactic treatments produce significant cost benefits because of the reduced hospitalisation and antibiotic use associated with neutropenia. To maximise positive outcomes, elderly patients should be included in clinical trials of new cancer agents. Since myelosuppression is the main risk factor for elderly patients undergoing chemotherapy, optimisation of growth factor support and the development of more effective and safer myelopoietic agents may improve success rates and reduce adverse events.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) occurs with common chemotherapy regimens in 25 to 40% of treatment-naive patients, and its severity depends on the dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the patient's prior history of either radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities. The occurrence of FN often causes subsequent chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen hospital stay, increase monitoring, diagnostic and treatment costs, and reduce patient quality of life. A decade after their introduction, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are now an integral part of the prevention of potentially life-threatening FN; however, only G-CSF has US Food and Drug Administration approval for use in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. These adjunctive agents accelerate formation of neutrophils from committed progenitors, thereby reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia. Important uses of CSFs in oncology are prevention of FN after chemotherapy, treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes and support following bone marrow transplantation, and collection of CSF-mobilised peripheral blood progenitor cells. G-CSF is used more frequently than GM-CSF for all of these indications because of fewer associated adverse effects. Clinical trials to date have not demonstrated a significant effect on overall survival or disease-free survival, which is most likely to be due to small sample size and lack of power to prove effect. However, they have demonstrated clinical utility in allowing the delivery of planned chemotherapy dose on schedule, an important clinical goal especially in curative tumour settings. The high cost of these agents limits their widespread use. Current American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend primary prophylaxis, or first cycle use, with CSFs being confined to patients with > or = 40% risk of FN, which may include elderly patients and other high-risk patients. In addition to the risk of FN, primary prophylaxis should also be considered if the patient has risk factors that place them in the Special Circumstances category. These risk factors may include decreased immune function in patients who are already at an increased risk of infection and pre-existing neutropenia due to disease, extensive prior chemotherapy, or previous irradiation to the pelvis or other areas containing large amounts of bone marrow. Future studies are needed to better define the patients most likely to benefit from CSF therapy, both for prophylaxis and as an adjunct to antibiotics for treatment of FN. Other potential uses include combination therapy with stem cell factors and other cytokines to boost progenitor cell development, maintaining dose intensity of salvage therapy in metastatic cancer patients, and application in patients with pneumonia, Crohn's fistulas, diabetic foot infections and a variety of other infectious conditions.","['Dale, David C']",['Dale DC'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-6422, USA. dcdale@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/02/06 04:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-200262001-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2002;62 Suppl 1:1-15. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200262001-00001.,,,108,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence suggesting the possible involvement of the Fc gammaRII immunoglobulin receptor in mediating retinoic acid-induced growth arrest and differentiation of HL-60 cells is presented. HL-60 cells stably transfected with the delta205 mutant polyoma middle T antigen, a largely debilitated polyoma middle T antigen, are known to undergo accelerated retinoic acid-induced growth arrest and differentiation compared with parental HL-60 cells. Delta205 transfected cells were compared with parental HL-60 cells by differential display to identify differentially expressed genes, which are regulated downstream of delta205 and might facilitate cellular response to retinoic acid. Differential display revealed that the Fc gammaRII immunoglobulin receptor was differentially expressed. HL-60 cells express Fc gammaRIIA but not Fc gammaRIIB. In parental HL-60 cells, retinoic acid up-regulated Fc gammaRII expression, and Fc gammaRII membrane protein expression increased concomitantly with retinoic acid-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Ectopic expression of Fc gammaRIIa1 in HL-60 cells retarded cellular progression through all phases of the cell cycle. For HL-60 cells stably transfected with Fc gammaRIIa1, onset of retinoic acid-induced growth arrest and differentiation occurred in fewer cell cycles than for parental HL-60 cells. Similar results occurred with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3. Retinoic acid-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various PAGE-detected protein bands in HL-60 cells was enhanced by cross-linking ectopically expressed Fc gammaRIIa1 receptor. The known retinoic acid-induced sustained activation of various mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, src-like kinases, and adapter molecules, may in part reflect induced expression of Fc gammaRIIA, which is known to activate a similar ensemble of signaling molecules through its ITAM domain. The data suggest that retinoic acid induces increased Fc gammaRIIA expression, which is of functional consequence in eliciting growth arrest and differentiation.","['Wightman, Jenifer', 'Roberson, Mark S', 'Lamkin, Thomas J', 'Varvayanis, Susi', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Wightman J', 'Roberson MS', 'Lamkin TJ', 'Varvayanis S', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['ESO7052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 May;1(7):493-506.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that XAGE-1 is also expressed in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and different types of lung cancers, including lung squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. In addition, XAGE-1 mRNA was present in ovarian cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, T-cell lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and histiocytic lymphoma cell lines. We also characterized the XAGE-1 transcript by primer extension analysis and found that transcription of the XAGE-1 gene is initiated from two distinct start sites, resulting in two overlapping transcripts, XAGE-1a and XAGE-1b. XAGE-1a contains two in-frame ATG translational start codons; whereas XAGE-1b initiates downstream of the first ATG start codon. Our results suggest that XAGE-1b is the dominant transcript, and that translation begins with the second ATG start codon, producing a 9 kDa protein. Because XAGE-1 is expressed in such a diverse range of cancers, it has potential to be used as a target for many cancer immunotherapies.","['Egland, Kristi A', 'Kumar, Vasantha', 'Duray, Paul', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Egland KA', 'Kumar V', 'Duray P', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4264, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (XAGE1A protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Testis/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/14 04:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/12/14 04:00'],"['2002/12/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 May;1(7):441-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of intracellular molecules might participate in this process. Our aim in this study is to investigate which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1) and which signal transduction pathway(JAK/STAT, Ras/MAPK, PI-3K/Akt) can mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 on a human myeloma cell line XG-7. METHODS: Apoptosis of XG-7 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide(PI) staining of nuclei. The expression of three Bcl-2 family proteins in XG-7 cells were monitored by immunoblot assay. AG490, PD98059, and LY294002, three specific antagonists for JAK/STAT, Ras/MAPK, and PI-3K/Akt signal transduction pathways respectively, were used to determine which signal transduction pathway was responsible for the effect of IL-6 on XG-7 cells. RESULTS: IL-6 inhibited the apoptosis of XG-7 cells and up-regulated the expression of only one of the three anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins-Mcl-1. In addition, up-regulation of Mcl-1 expression induced by IL-6 was significantly inhibited in the presence of AG490, while not of PD98059 and LY294002.

METHODS: The study included a group of 55 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies (28 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, 9 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 14 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 4 cases of other disease) from October 1999 to December 2001 undergoing either EA or other intensive chemotherapies as CTX, G-CSF mobilization began from the day when the WBC count reached nadir until the day of apheresis, then after stem cell reinfusion G-CSF support was given on day +3 until neutrophil recovery. The dose of G-CSF both in mobilization and recovery support was 250 micrograms/d s.c. despite the body weight of patients. RESULTS: The average time of G-CSF administrating as a mobilizing reagent was 7.12 days(range 3-14 days), and the mean time of interval from the beginning of chemotherapy to apheresis was 18.08 +/- 3.63 days.

Few studies have examined relationships and differences in reported results between the parent, child and clinician. We examined parent-proxy and clinician-reported functional status and health-related quality of life for children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Children and adolescents, 5-18 years, in the maintenance phase of treatment for ALL attending the Haematology/Oncology outpatient clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, were eligible. Measures included: 1) parent-reported functional health and well-being (Child Health Questionnaire [CHQ]); 2) parent-reported condition specific quality of life (Pediatric Cancer Quality of Life inventory [PCQL]); 3) clinician ratings of physical and psychosocial health; and 4) clinical indicators. Insufficient numbers of older patients prohibited collection of adolescent self-reports. We had a 94% response and 31 participants. Mean time since diagnosis: 1.5 (SD 0.4) years. Parents reported significantly lower functioning and well-being than population norms for all CHQ scales, whereas cancer-specific quality of life was comparable to PCQL norms. Clinician reports of the child's global physical and psychosocial health were moderately associated with each other (r(s) = 0.56, p < 0.001), and with the parent-reported physical (r(s) = 0.47, p < 0.01) and psychosocial (r(s) = 0.56, p < 0.001) CHQ summary scores. Clinician reports of the child's psychosocial health were not associated with any clinical indicators reported regularly. The results demonstrate that the social, physical and emotional health and well-being of children with ALL is significantly poorer than the health of their community-based peers. Routinely collected indicators of clinical progress conceal the psychosocial burden of ALL. Data on health, well-being and quality of life can easily be incorporated into clinical care.","['Waters, Elizabeth B', 'Wake, Melissa A', 'Hesketh, Kylie D', 'Ashley, David M', 'Smibert, Elizabeth']","['Waters EB', 'Wake MA', 'Hesketh KD', 'Ashley DM', 'Smibert E']","[""Centre for Community Child Health, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia. waterse@cryptic.rch.unimelb.edu.au""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emotions', 'Family Health', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/13 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2002/12/13 04:00'],"['2002/12/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10815 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Feb 10;103(4):514-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10815.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial sequence analyses of the tax genes (433 bp) indicated that these baboons were infected by a novel divergent simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV). Analyses of the complete proviral sequence (8,892 bp) for one of these strains (STLV-3/PPA-F3) indicate that this STLV was highly divergent from the HTLV-1 (61.6% of nucleotide similarity), HTLV-2 (61.2%), or STLV-2 (60.6%) prototype. It was, however, much more closely related to the few other known STLV-3 strains, exhibiting 87 and 89% of nucleotide similarity with STLV-3/PHA-PH969 (formerly PTLV-L/PH969) and STLV-3/CTO-604, respectively. The STLV-3/PPA-F3 sequence possesses the major HTLV or STLV open reading frames corresponding to the structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins. However, its long terminal repeat comprises only two 21-bp repeats. In all phylogenetic analyses, STLV-3/PPA-F3 clustered together in a highly supported single clade with the other known strains of STLV-3, indicating an independent evolution from primate T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) and PTLV-2. The finding of a new strain of STLV-3 in a West African monkey (Guinea baboon) greatly enlarges the geographical distribution and the host range of species infected by this PTLV type in the African continent. The recent discovery of several different STLV-3 strains in many different African monkey species, often in contact with humans, strongly suggests potential interspecies transmission events, as it was described for STLV-1, between nonhuman primates but also to humans.","['Meertens, Laurent', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Meertens L', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement Ecosystemes et Epidemiologie des Maladies Infectieuses, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cercocebus/virology', 'Cercopithecus/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Papio/*virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3/*classification/genetics/immunology', 'Senegal']",PMC140582,2002/12/13 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/12/13 04:00'],"['2002/12/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.1.782-789.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(1):782-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.1.782-789.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the flanking regions can affect RNA packaging, virus assembly, and reverse transcription of the viral RNA. To gain a further understanding of the roles of NC flanking regions in the retroviral replication cycle, we generated and characterized chimeric gag-pol expression constructs derived from murine leukemia virus and spleen necrosis virus by replacing an NC flanking region from one virus with the counterpart from the other virus. We found that all four chimeras were able to generate virions, package viral RNA, and complete the viral replication cycle. Two chimeras had mild defects in virus assembly that correlated with a decrease in the isoelectric points of NCs, suggesting that the basic nature of NC is important in virus assembly. This finding indicates that, although the primary sequences of these flanking regions have little homology, the heterologous sequences are functional both as part of the Gag polyprotein and as processed NC protein.","['Fu, William', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Fu W', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleocapsid/*chemistry/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virion/physiology', '*Virus Replication']",PMC140598,2002/12/13 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/12/13 04:00'],"['2002/12/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.1.754-761.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(1):754-61. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.1.754-761.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have used transient expression of HPV1 E4 (also known as E1E4) protein in keratinocytes to reproduce formation of E4 inclusions. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that progressive formation of inclusions correlated with diminished colocalization between E4 and keratin intermediate filaments (IFs). Our results support a model in which the HPV1 E4-keratin IF association is transient, occurring only at an early stage of inclusion formation. We also demonstrate that E4 induces relocation of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) from multiple intranuclear speckles (ND10 bodies) to the periphery of nuclear E4 inclusions and that this activity is specific to full-length E4 protein. Analysis of HPV1-induced warts demonstrated that nuclear PML-E4 inclusions were present in productively infected keratinocytes, indicating that reorganization of PML occurs during the virus's replication cycle. It has been suggested that ND10 bodies are the sites for papillomavirus genome replication and virion assembly. Our finding that E4 induces reorganization of ND10 bodies in vitro and in vivo is further strong evidence that these domains play an important role in the papillomavirus life cycle. This study indicates that HPV1 is analogous to other DNA viruses that disrupt or reorganize ND10 domains, possibly to increase efficiency of virus infection. We hypothesize that HPV1 E4-induced reorganization of PML is necessary for efficient replication of the virus during the virus-producing phase.","['Roberts, Sally', 'Hillman, Michele L', 'Knight, Gillian L', 'Gallimore, Phillip H']","['Roberts S', 'Hillman ML', 'Knight GL', 'Gallimore PH']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. s.roberts@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (oncogene protein E4, human papilloma virus type 1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/*metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/*virology', 'Keratins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Replication', 'Warts/*virology']",PMC140640,2002/12/13 04:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/12/13 04:00'],"['2002/12/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.1.673-684.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jan;77(1):673-84. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.1.673-684.2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had circulating peripheral blasts and bone marrow blast counts as high as 64% when she received recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF). Her marrow blasts decreased to 4-20% when rG-CSF was discontinued. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on bone marrow cell populations sorted by flow cytometry to determine which cell populations had the AML-1/ETO translocation. The translocation was found in mature neutrophils and blasts, but not in monocytes, lymphocytes or stem cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the translocation occurred in a neutrophil progenitor, past the point in ontogeny where monocytes and neutrophils separate.

Second generation inhibitors were taken into clinical trials in leukemia, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and sarcoma, malignancies for which there is evidence that P-gp is expressed, and in some cases, associated with a poorer therapeutic outcome. One major limitation of these trials, however, was the reduction in anticancer drug doses that was required with concurrent administration of inhibitor. The reduction in drug dose needed in these combination studies, may have confounded the results and contributed to disappointing outcomes.

The use of recombinant adenoviruses as a therapeutic tool for lymphoproliferative disorders has also been evaluated in this context. Several approaches of adenovirus-mediated gene expression have been used to transfect cell lines that are derived from lymphoid tumors and would have otherwise been refractory to other transfection methods. The identification of high affinity receptor for human adenoviruses serotype 2 and 5, the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR), has raised the question about its relevance for the efficacy of recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene therapy. We have reviewed the published studies that have examined the use of recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing cytotoxic genes for gene therapy in lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Based on the concept that a recombinant adenovirus particle behaves like a drug, we address the issue of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy in terms of classic pharmacodynamics. We have analyzed the use of recombinant adenovirus-mediated cytotoxicity by assessing the importance of the biochemical and physiological signaling pathways interacting with these particular drugs and their mechanisms of action. The case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is discussed as an example that better illustrates the concept of pharmacodynamics of recombinant adenoviral-mediated expression of cytotoxic genes. Ultimately, the issues derived from the use of such a modality of therapy that require further evaluation, are discussed in this review.","['Turturro, Francesco']",['Turturro F'],"['Stoddard Cancer Research Institute and Division of Hematology-Oncology, VA Central Iowa Health Care System, Des Moines, IA, USA.

This oncoprotein has several intracellular functions; however, the most important effect of P210(BCR-ABL) leading to cell transformation is phosphorylation of signaling molecules through a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain. Despite extensive knowledge of the structure and functional domains of BCR-ABL, its precise function in transformation is not known. Progress has been hampered, in part, by the lack of relevant CML models, as cell culture and in vitro assays do not mimic the pathogenesis of CML. Recently, there has been significant progress toward improving murine models that closely resemble human CML. This has allowed researchers to evaluate critical functions of BCR-ABL and has provided a model to test the efficacy of therapeutic medications that block these pathways. Our laboratory has developed two intersecting research programs to better understand the functioning of P210(BCR-ABL) in leukemogenesis. In one approach, we have developed a murine CML model by transferring HSCs that express BCR-ABL from a retroviral vector. All recipients develop a rapidly fatal MPD that shares several important features with CML. This model has been extremely useful for studying the function of BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of CML. A second approach utilizes a quantitative cell detachment apparatus capable of measuring small changes in cell adhesion to investigate the mechanism by which P210(BCR-ABL) causes abnormal cell binding. Altered cell adhesion may contribute to the imbalance between proliferation and self-renewal in the hematopoietic progenitor compartment. To better understand the role abnormal adhesion may play in the development of leukemia, we have attempted to correlate the effects of functional P210(BCR-ABL) mutants in regulating adhesion and oncogenicity.","['Wertheim, Jason A', 'Miller, Juli P', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'He, Yiping', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Wertheim JA', 'Miller JP', 'Xu L', 'He Y', 'Pear WS']","['Institute for Medicine and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA77570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-DK50306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Adhesion', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206089 [doi]', '1206089 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Dec 9;21(56):8612-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206089.,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, downregulation of the levels and activity of Bcr-Abl is clearly the lynchpin of a rational therapeutic strategy against all phases of CML. Support for this has only been strengthened by the observations that resistance to imatinib mesylate (imatinib) commonly involves a breakthrough and the persistent activity of Bcr-Abl TK. This is due to either mutations that inhibit imatinib action on Bcr-Abl TK or amplification of the bcr-abl gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Bcr-Abl TK may be highly active in inducing differentiation and apoptosis of CML progenitors, regardless of their sensitivity to imatinib. Small molecule inhibitors that downregulate the levels of Bcr-Abl by inhibiting its translation, e.g., arsenic trioxide, or promoting its proteasomal degradation, e.g., geldanamycin analogues, have also been identified.

Two isolates of the virus encoding proteins of p120 Kd and 160 Kd have been extensively studied. These viral isolates have been found to transform both hematopoietic and fibroblastic cells in vitro, while inducing predominantly pre-B cell leukemias in vivo. Both p120(v-Abl) and p160(v-Abl) are plasma membrane-associated non-receptor tyrosine kinases and the transforming activity of these proteins requires their tyrosine kinase activity. A-MuLV infection of hematopoietic cells has often been found to result in the abrogation of their cytokine-dependence for growth. In addition, v-Abl expressing hematopoietic cells often lose their ability to differentiate in response to appropriate cytokines. This review discusses some of the early transformation studies of A-MuLV, as well as some of the findings concerning the structure and biochemical activity of the v-Abl protein.

The first exon of the BCR gene is a critical part of this fusion, as the coiled-coil domain at the amino terminal domain of the Bcr protein causes oligomerization of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein forming tetramers, thereby activating the tyrosine kinase activity of the normally silent c-Abl protein. Another consequence of this Bcr-Abl fusion is the extensive autophosphorylation of the cis Bcr protein sequences on tyrosine residues. This review will summarize the effects of Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation on tyrosines as they relate to the oncogenic activity of Bcr-Abl, and as a means to inactivate the serine/threonine kinase activity of the Bcr protein. The review also discusses our findings that show that phosphoserine Bcr by means of a unique structure, binds to the Abl SH2 domain of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, and as a result this SH2 binding inhibits the oncogenic effects of the oncoprotein. Our results indicate that one effect of this binding is inhibition of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Serine 354 of Bcr plays a major role in this inhibition. In the case of Bcr(64-413), serine 354 is required for the formation of the unique Bcr structure that binds to the Abl SH2 domain.","['Arlinghaus, Ralph B']",['Arlinghaus RB'],"['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

The syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate; and current treatment options are limited. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, Novoseven) has recently been approved for the treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A/B with inhibitors. A greater understanding of the mechanism by which rFVIIa restores hemostasis has recently become available; with in vitro evidence supporting that the thrombin burst achieved by rFVIIa is independent of the presence or binding to tissue factor. This insight has suggested a range of other potential clinical uses for the drug; including the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage. We review our experience with using rFVIIa for treatment of DAH in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia following a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Boluses of 90 microg/kg rFVIIa were given every 3 h x 4 doses/day, concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids and maintenance of a platelet count >50 000/mm(3). Rapid clinical and radiological improvement was noted within several doses of rFVIIa, with discontinuation of the drug after eight doses. However, the patient's clinical condition began to rapidly deteriorate following cessation of rVIIa, resulting in reinstitution of therapy 24 h later. The patient again exhibited rapid clinical improvement; and rFVIIa was continued for an additional 16 doses with no further evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage noted. No toxicity or adverse events were observed with rFVIIa treatment. Our experience indicates that rFVIIa may be an effective treatment option for DAH post bone marrow transplant; although further clinical studies are needed before recommendations can be made regarding off label use of rFVIIa in this clinical setting.","['Hicks, K', 'Peng, D', 'Gajewski, J L']","['Hicks K', 'Peng D', 'Gajewski JL']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'CAT-G protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Factor VIIa/*therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/*therapy', 'Pneumothorax/etiology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703731 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Dec;30(12):975-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If T lymphocytes infiltrating GVHD lesions recognize antigens expressed in these organs, T cell clones should expand in inflammatory tissues. We previously reported that recipients of allogeneic bone marrow grafts have clonally expanded TCRalphabeta(+) T lymphocytes soon after transplantation, which leads to a skew of TCR repertoires. To establish whether or not the same antigens cause clonal expansion of T lymphocytes in both blood and GVHD tissues, we examined the usage of TCR alpha and beta chain variable regions (TCRAV and TCRBV) and determined the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of T lymphocytes clonally expanded in circulating blood and GVHD lesions.

Fifteen high-risk leukemia patients, who needed urgent transplantation but lacked an HLA-matched donor, underwent G-CSF-primed haploidentical marrow transplantation without ex vivo T cell depletion. Donors were given G-CSF (Lenograstim) at 3-4 microg/kg/day for 7 days prior to marrow harvest. GVHD and HVGR prophylaxis were combined in the sequential usage of cyclosporin A, methotrexate, anti-thymocyte globulin and mycophenolate mofetil. All patients established sustained trilineage engraftment at a median of 19 days and 21 days for neutrophil and platelets respectively. G-CSF priming significantly increased CD34(+) and CFU-GM cells, reduced total lymphocytes and reversed the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in the donor marrow. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 33.3%. Nine patients survived more than a year with a Karnofsky performance status of 100%. Estimated overall disease-free survival at 2 years was 60 +/- 7%.

Now, with the availability of a humanised form, alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), and the demonstration that this agent can reduce the tumour burden in B-CLL, a new niche may be found - as a potentially curative agent in which its tumour purging ability in vivo combines with its role as a conditioning agent in nonmyeloablative transplantation. Review of the literature shows that alemtuzumab has unique advantages as a method of depleting malignant lymphocytes, including those in patients resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Alemtuzumab can also be used in BMT for depletion of normal T and B lymphocytes of both the recipient and donor for prevention of graft rejection and GVHD. It allows good stem cell recovery with resultant rapid engraftment, has a low risk of EBV-triggered secondary malignancy and does not interfere with blood stem cell mobilisation. As a method of eliminating the malignant clone in B-CLL, alemtuzumab has shown remarkable efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients, a number of whom have progressed to autologous or allogeneic transplantation. Efficacy data are shown within the context of other transplantation data for B-CLL. These results indicate that the combination of tumour-depleting and immunosuppressive properties of alemtuzumab should be explored, with the hope of providing improved treatment options for elderly patients with advanced B-CLL or indolent lymphoma whose prognosis is too poor currently to allow treatment with traditional regimens of high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy.","['Hale, G', 'Slavin, S', 'Goldman, J M', 'Mackinnon, S', 'Giralt, S', 'Waldmann, H']","['Hale G', 'Slavin S', 'Goldman JM', 'Mackinnon S', 'Giralt S', 'Waldmann H']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703733 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Dec;30(12):797-804. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703733.,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we identified Mcl-1S (short) as a short splicing variant of the Mcl-1 gene with proapoptotic activity. To identify Mcl-1-interacting proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and found cDNAs encoding tankyrase 1. This protein possesses poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and presumably facilitates the turnover of substrates following ADP-ribosylation. In yeast and mammalian cells, tankyrase 1 interacts with both Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S, but does not bind to other Bcl-2 family proteins tested. Analysis of truncated tankyrase 1 mutants indicated that the first 10 ankyrin repeats are involved in interaction with Mcl-1. In the N terminus of Mcl-1, a stretch of 25 amino acids is sufficient for binding to tankyrase 1. Overexpression of tankyrase 1 antagonizes both Mcl-1L-mediated cell survival and Mcl-1S-induced cell death. Furthermore, coexpression of tankyrase 1 with Mcl-1L or Mcl-1S decreased the levels of Mcl-1 proteins. Although tankyrase 1 down-regulates Mcl-1 protein expression, no ADP-ribosylation of Mcl-1 was detected. In contrast, overexpression of Mcl-1 proteins suppressed the ADP-ribosylation of the telomeric repeat binding factor 1, another tankyrase 1-interacting protein. Thus, interaction of Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S with tankyrase 1 could serve as a unique mechanism to decrease the expression of these Bcl-2 family proteins, thereby leading to the modulation of the apoptosis pathway.","['Bae, Jeehyeon', 'Donigian, Jill R', 'Hsueh, Aaron J W']","['Bae J', 'Donigian JR', 'Hsueh AJ']","['Division of Reproductive Biology, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5317, USA.']",['eng'],['HD31566/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Tankyrases)', 'EC 2.4.4.30 (TNKS protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tankyrases/genetics/*metabolism']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M201988200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32829-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Feb 14;278(7):5195-204. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M201988200.

While investigating the role of Src kinases in SCF signaling, we found that PP1 completely abrogated the proliferation of M07e cells in response to SCF. PP1 inhibited SCF-induced c-Kit autophosphorylation in intact cells and blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. In vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated c-Kit confirmed direct inhibition by PP1. SCF-induced c-Kit phosphorylation was also inhibited by the related inhibitor 4-amino-5- (4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP2) and by STI571 but not by the Src inhibitor SU6656. PP1 inhibited the activity of mutant constitutively active forms of c-Kit (D814V and D814Y) found in mast cell disorders, and triggered apoptosis in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 that expresses mutant c-Kit. In addition, PP1 (and PP2) inhibited the in vitro kinase activity and autophosphorylation in whole cells of p210 Bcr-Abl. PP1 reduced the constitutive activation of signal transducer and activators of transcription 5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase and triggered apoptosis in FDCP1 cells expressing Bcr-Abl. These results have implications for the use of PP1 in investigating intracellular signaling and suggest that PP1 or related compounds may be useful in the treatment of malignant diseases associated with dysregulated c-Kit or Abl tyrosine kinase activity.","['Tatton, Louise', 'Morley, Gary M', 'Chopra, Rajesh', 'Khwaja, Asim']","['Tatton L', 'Morley GM', 'Chopra R', 'Khwaja A']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, 98 Chenies Mews, London WC1E 6HX, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(tert-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M209321200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)32787-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Feb 14;278(7):4847-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M209321200.

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 3 healthy persons, cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) collected from 5 healthy persons and 4 human myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines including J6-1, J6-2, K562 and HL-60 were studied by using ABC immunoperoxidaes assay, indirect immunofluorescene staining, flow cytometry, and Western blot. RESULTS: M-CSF-R was noticed to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and at the membrane in 4 human leukemia cell lines; expression of M-CSF-R was not detected in normal human PBMCs without PHA stimulation. Human PBMCs stimulated by PHA expressed a low level of M-CSF-R. Frequencies of membrane bound M-CSF-R (M-CSF-mR) expression in J6-1, J6-2, K562 and HL-60 were 78.9%, 72.6%, 54.9% and 58.0% respectively. Frequencies of cytoplasm and nucleus associated M-CSF-R (M-CSF-cnR) were 52.3%, 44.3%, 28.0% and 65.3% respectively. One form of M-CSF-R with a molecular weight of 120 000 was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HL-60 cells. The half-life of M-CSF-cnR in leukemia cells mentioned above was longer than that of corresponding M-CSF-R in stimulated CBMCs, and the half-life of M-CSF-mR in leukemia cells was extended except that of M-CSF-mR in K562 cells. Both anti-M-CSF-R monoclonal antibody and recombinant human M-CSF soluble receptor could cause the growth arrest of HL-60 cell in G(0)/G(1) phase, and could inhibit the formation of colony of HL-60 cell in soft agarose. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of M-CSF-R in leukemia cells is heterogeneous. The accumulation of cellular M-CSF-R results in the low degradation rate of cellular M-CSF-R in leukemia cells, which could be a potential mitotic signal. Signal mediated by M-CSF-R is important and necessary for the growth of HL-60 cell.","['Tang, Shengsong', 'Chen, Guibin', 'Rao, Qing', 'Geng, Yiqi', 'Wu, Kefu']","['Tang S', 'Chen G', 'Rao Q', 'Geng Y', 'Wu K']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute Of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', '*Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Jun;31(3):240-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of K152 in the mechanism of the polymerase reaction catalyzed by MuLV RT, four mutant RTs, namely, K152A, K152R, K152E, and K152G, were generated and biochemically characterized. All muteins exhibited reduced polymerase activity on both RNA and DNA template-primers with K152E being the most defective. The template-primer binding affinity and the processivity of DNA synthesis, however, remained unchanged. The steady-state kinetic characterization showed little change in K(m.dNTP) (except for that of K152E) and an approximately 3-10-fold decrease in k(cat) depending upon the template-primer and mutational substitutions. The ddNTP resistance patterns were unchanged for all muteins, suggesting no participation of K152 in ddNTP recognition. The ability of individual muteins to add dNTP on the covalently cross-linked enzyme-template-primer complex was significantly decreased. These results together with the analysis of the ion pairs in the catalytic apparatus of MuLV RT suggest that K152 participates in maintaining the integrity of the active site of MuLV RT. Examination of the prepolymerase ternary complex formation showed that neither the wild type nor any of the K152 muteins of MuLV RT are capable of forming stable ternary complexes. This property is in contrast to that of HIV-1 RT, which readily forms stable ternary complexes under similar conditions. These results further indicate that the catalytic mechanism of MuLV RT is significantly different from that of HIV-1 RT, despite the presence of a number of conserved motifs and amino acid residues.","['Shi, Qingli', 'Singh, Kamalendra', 'Srivastava, Aashish', 'Kaushik, Neerja', 'Modak, Mukund J']","['Shi Q', 'Singh K', 'Srivastava A', 'Kaushik N', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],['GM 36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Diphosphates)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Dideoxynucleosides/chemistry', 'Diphosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lysine/*chemistry/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnesium/chemistry', 'Manganese/chemistry', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Potassium Chloride/chemistry', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['bi0258389 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0258389 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2002 Dec 17;41(50):14831-42. doi: 10.1021/bi0258389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast amount of data generated by these technologies has presented new challenges in bioinformatics. To help organize and interpret microarray data, new and efficient computational methods are needed to: (1) distinguish accurately between different biological or clinical categories (e.g., malignant vs. benign), and (2) identify specific genes that play a role in determining those categories. Here we present a novel and simple method that exhaustively scans microarray data for unambiguous gene expression patterns. Such patterns of data can be used as the basis for classification into biological or clinical categories. The method, termed the Characteristic Attribute Organization System (CAOS), is derived from fundamental precepts in systematic biology. In CAOS we define two types of characteristic attributes ('pure' and 'private') that may exist in gene expression microarray data. We also consider additional attributes ('compound') that are composed of expression states of more than one gene that are not characteristic on their own. CAOS was tested on three well-known cancer DNA microarray data sets for its ability to classify new microarray samples. We found CAOS to be a highly accurate and robust class prediction technique. In addition, CAOS identified specific genes, not emphasized in other analyses, that may be crucial to the biology of certain types of cancer. The success of CAOS in this study has significant implications for basic research and the future development of reliable methods for clinical diagnostic tools.","['Sarkar, I N', 'Planet, P J', 'Bael, T E', 'Stanley, S E', 'Siddall, M', 'DeSalle, R', 'Figurski, D H']","['Sarkar IN', 'Planet PJ', 'Bael TE', 'Stanley SE', 'Siddall M', 'DeSalle R', 'Figurski DH']","['Department of Medical Informatics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],['LM07079-09/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/classification/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic/classification', '*Gene Expression Profiling/classification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/classification', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Software']",,2002/12/12 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/12/12 04:00'],"['2002/12/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1532-0464(02)00504-X [pii]', '10.1016/s1532-0464(02)00504-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2002 Apr;35(2):111-22. doi: 10.1016/s1532-0464(02)00504-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that expression of Mcl-1 in MCL is heterogeneous. A relatively high level of Mcl-1 expression correlates with high-grade morphology, a high proliferative state, and p53 overexpression.","['Khoury, Joseph D', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Rassidakis, George Z', 'McDonnell, Timothy J', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Lai, Raymond']","['Khoury JD', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Lai R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/02/20 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1254 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2003 Jan;199(1):90-7. doi: 10.1002/path.1254.,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From combinatorial peptide phage display libraries displaying the random linear heptapeptides and dodecapeptides, we selected clones with affinity to anti-JL1 mAb through repeated rounds of panning on a mAb-coated ELISA plate. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of the peptide epitopes were then studied using chemically synthesized peptides. RESULTS: The selected clones had the LXPSIP consensus sequence. Two synthetic peptides LPPSIPFGLTVGGGGS and LLPSIPNQAYLGGGGS specifically reacted with anti-JL1 mAb in ELISA. These two peptides were found to inhibit the interaction between anti-JL1 mAb and JL1 antigen-positive Molt-4 cells. Although the immune sera raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides failed to react with Molt-4 cells, it showed strong reactivity to the peptide epitope. However, one mAb raised by peptide immunization successfully bound to Molt-4 cells. CONCLUSION: An epitope-mimetic peptide of anti-JL1 mAb was found using combinatorial peptide phage display libraries. It induced strong humoral response against itself, but only a limited fraction of this humoral response was cross-reactive with the original JL1 antigen.","['Chung, Junho', 'Park, Sojung', 'Kim, Dongjo', 'Rhim, Junghyo', 'Kim, Ikjung', 'Choi, Inhak', 'Yi, Kyesook', 'Ryu, Sungho', 'Suh, Pannghill', 'Chung, Doohyun', 'Bae, Youngmee', 'Shin, Youngkee', 'Park, Sunghoe']","['Chung J', 'Park S', 'Kim D', 'Rhim J', 'Kim I', 'Choi I', 'Yi K', 'Ryu S', 'Suh P', 'Chung D', 'Bae Y', 'Shin Y', 'Park S']","['National Cancer Center, Ilsan-gu, Goyang, Gyeonggi, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (JL1 antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*chemistry/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/chemistry/immunology', 'Peptide Library', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-002-0390-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2002 Dec;128(12):641-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-002-0390-x.

THH showed clear cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in HL-60 cells at concentrations between 6.7 and 20.0 mg/ml. When the mutants were characterized by techniques based on multiplex PCR, 46.6% of induced mutants were found to have deletions, whereas only 7.7% of spontaneous mutants showed deletions. The rest were not characterized, but were assumed to be mainly point mutations. Mapping of all intragenic deletion breakpoints showed a random distribution of breakpoints in nine exons. Deletion of exon 1 appeared as the only whole gene deletion, while deletions of exon 7/8 and 9 often occurred concomitantly (71.4%).

Dihydrokainate prevented an efflux of DOX by inhibiting the uptake of glutamate by tumor cells. We examined the potential of glutamate transporter inhibitors as modulators of DOX activity. We observed a significant reduction in the uptake of glutamate by other inhibitors and a similar effect on DOX efflux in M5076 ovarian sarcoma cells. However, in vivo, the tissue distribution of each isoform is different, and glutamate transporter inhibitors with different affinities for each isoform affected tumors and normal tissues differently. L-Serine-O-sulfate, which has high affinity to glutamate/aspartate transporter, particularly enhanced the antitumor activity of DOX in M5076 tumor-bearing mice. In contrast, L-alpha-aminoadipate tended to increase the DOX concentration in normal tissues rather than tumors. It was shown that the relation between glutamate transporter isoforms and the selective affinity of inhibitors could selectively affect the antitumor activity and side effects of DOX. Furthermore, the effects of inhibitors varied among cells expressing different isoforms. Notably, a low concentration of L-serine-O-sulfate actually increased the uptake of glutamate in P388 leukemia cells.","['Sadzuka, Yasuyuki', 'Yamashita, Yasuyo', 'Sonobe, Takashi']","['Sadzuka Y', 'Yamashita Y', 'Sonobe T']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System X-AG)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '52497-36-6 (dihydrokainic acid)', '626-69-7 (serine O-sulfate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SIV03811UC (Kainic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System X-AG/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glutamates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kainic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;8(12):3943-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Real-time multiplex assay for t(12;21), t(4;11), and t(1;19) with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase as internal standard used in tandem with a new real time quantitative-RT-PCR assay for the t(9;22). This new strategy was designed to yield an amplicon from each translocation with a distinct melting peak allowing dependable identification using only Sybr green I, without any need for expensive hybridization probes. RESULTS: We validated this method with 92 primary ALLs and identified 4 E2A-PBX1, 4 mBCR-ABL and 10 TEL-AML1. When compared with conventional RT-PCRs and Southern blot analyses, 100% concordance was obtained. During the course of these studies, we found marked variations in the levels of the TEL-AML1 transcripts in individual patients. We, therefore, extended the study to accurately and reproducibly determine TEL-AML1 mRNA levels in 47 additional patients with t(12;21). The results indicated that the level of expression of TEL-AML1 varied among individual patients, and it was independent of the WBC count. CONCLUSIONS: Our new real-time multiplex assay can be used for rapid, simple, and reliable classification of pediatric ALL. Its reproducible quantification results should also facilitate studies on minimal residual disease. The observed variation in TEL-AML1 transcript levels is of interest because it could reflect biological and/or clinical heterogeneity in the behavior of these leukemias.","['Siraj, Abdul K', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Sirma, Sema', 'Timson, Georgina', 'Al-Nasser, Abdallah', 'Bhargava, Manorama', 'El Solh, Hassan', 'Bhatia, Kishor', 'Gutierrez, Marina I']","['Siraj AK', 'Ozbek U', 'Sazawal S', 'Sirma S', 'Timson G', 'Al-Nasser A', 'Bhargava M', 'El Solh H', 'Bhatia K', 'Gutierrez MI']","[""Research, King Fahad National Centre for Children's Cancer and Research, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, 11211 Saudi Arabia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;8(12):3832-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients had nonhematological malignancies for which standard therapy did not exist or was no longer effective and had tumors that overexpressed HER2. IL-2 was initially administered at a dose of 1.25 million IU/m(2) (low dose) s.c. daily except for 3 days every 2 weeks, when it was given at a dose of 15 million IU/m(2) (intermediate dose). These doses were reduced to 1.0 million and 12 million IU/m(2) after the first 18 patients. Trastuzumab was administered i.v. just before the first intermediate IL-2 dose and was escalated in cohorts of six or more patients from 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks to 8 mg/kg weekly. In vitro cytotoxicity testing was performed with patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HER2-overexpressing cell lines. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were treated. Dose-related toxicity from trastuzumab was not observed. IL-2-related toxicities such as fever, chills, and fatigue were less common with the reduced doses of IL-2. There were two grade 3 and three grade 4 pulmonary reactions. Four major responses were observed, all in breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab doses of at least 4.0 mg/kg. Although IL-2 produced expansion of natural killer cell subsets, there was no correlation between in vitro cytotoxicity and clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: A regimen of IL-2 combined with trastuzumab is feasible, and response numbers are encouraging. Further testing of this regimen is warranted if the pulmonary toxicity can be ameliorated.","['Fleming, Gini F', 'Meropol, Neal J', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Hollis, Donna R', 'Carson, William E 3rd', 'Caligiuri, Michael', 'Mortimer, Joanne', 'Tkaczuk, Katherine', 'Parihar, Robin', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Ratain, Mark J']","['Fleming GF', 'Meropol NJ', 'Rosner GL', 'Hollis DR', 'Carson WE 3rd', 'Caligiuri M', 'Mortimer J', 'Tkaczuk K', 'Parihar R', 'Schilsky RL', 'Ratain MJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA. gfleming@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics', 'Trastuzumab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Dec;8(12):3718-27.,['Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1573'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central to both Gag protein arrangements is the capsid (CA) protein, a domain of PrGag, which is cleaved from the precursor to yield a mature Gag protein composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD), a flexible linker region, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). Because Gag interactions have proven difficult to examine in virions, a number of investigations have focused on the analysis of structures assembled in vitro. We have used electron microscope (EM) image reconstruction techniques to examine assembly products formed by two different CA variants of both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Interestingly, two types of hexameric protein arrangements were observed for each virus type. One organizational scheme featured hexamers composed of putative NTD dimer subunits, with sharing of subunits between neighbor hexamers. The second arrangement used apparent NTD monomers to coordinate hexamers, involved no subunit sharing, and employed putative CTD interactions to connect hexamers. Conversion between the two assembly forms may be achieved by making or breaking the proposed symmetric NTD dimer contacts in a process that appears to mimic viral morphogenesis.","['Mayo, Keith', 'Huseby, Doug', 'McDermott, Jason', 'Arvidson, Brian', 'Finlay, Liam', 'Barklis, Eric']","['Mayo K', 'Huseby D', 'McDermott J', 'Arvidson B', 'Finlay L', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute and Department of Microbiology MC L220, Oregon Health and Science University, 31814 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Portland, OR 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM 52914-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 60170-3/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'HIV-1/chemistry/growth & development', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry/growth & development', 'Static Electricity', '*Virus Assembly']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022283602011762 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2836(02)01176-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2003 Jan 3;325(1):225-37. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2836(02)01176-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, in vitro and in vivo modulations of MDR by ginsenoside Rg(3), a red ginseng saponin, were investigated. In flow cytometric analysis using rhodamine 123 as an artificial substrate, Rg(3) promoted accumulation of rhodamine 123 in drug-resistant KBV20C cells in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no effect on parental KB cells. Additionally Rg(3) inhibited [3H]vinblastine efflux and reversed MDR to doxorubicin, COL, VCR, and VP-16 in KBV20C cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immuno-blot analysis after exposure of KBV20C cells to Rg(3) showed that inhibition of drug efflux by Rg(3) was due to neither repression of MDR1 gene expression nor Pgp level. Photo-affinity labeling study with [3H]azidopine, however, revealed that Rg(3) competed with [3H]azidopine for binding to the Pgp demonstrating that Rg(3) competed with anticancer drug for binding to Pgp thereby blocking drug efflux. Furthermore, Rg(3) increased life span in mice implanted with DOX-resistant murine leukemia P388 cells in vivo and inhibited body weight increase significantly.","['Kim, Seung-Whan', 'Kwon, Hyog-young', 'Chi, Dong-Whan', 'Shim, Jai-Heon', 'Park, Jong-Dae', 'Lee, You-Hui', 'Pyo, Suhkneung', 'Rhee, Dong-Kwon']","['Kim SW', 'Kwon HY', 'Chi DW', 'Shim JH', 'Park JD', 'Lee YH', 'Pyo S', 'Rhee DK']","['College of Pharmacy, SungKyunKwan University, Su-Won 440-746, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '227D367Y57 (ginsenoside Rg3)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '63XR70204A (azidopine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Azides/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Dihydropyridines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/mortality', 'Mice', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacokinetics']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/28 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202014466 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01446-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Jan 1;65(1):75-82. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01446-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to develop a simple, inexpensive Ab cocktail that would provide subpopulations of cells enriched for CD34+ cells and simultaneously depleted of CD15+ mature myeloid cells. METHODS: Cells from leukapheresis products from CML patients at diagnosis were incubated with each of two Ab cocktails. The standard cocktail (debulking, DB), containing 11 Abs, is recommended for obtaining a highly enriched population of CD34+ cells. The efficacy of an alternative, simpler cocktail (CML custom, CC), containing only four Abs was tested. The recoveries of CD34+ cells, CD15+ cells, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage, and LTCIC were monitored. The samples were then cryopreserved, thawed, and the recoveries remeasured. RESULTS: The purity of CD34+ cells was significantly superior using the DB cocktail than with the CC cocktail. Conversely, using the CC cocktail, the yield of CD34+ cells was significantly higher compared to the DB cocktail. These results were maintained even when the amount of Ab was reduced 10-fold. Both Ab cocktails consistently removed > 99% of the CD15+ cells. Consistent with the CD34+ cell-enrichment data, higher colony-forming cell (CFC) frequencies were obtained with the DB cocktail, although superior yields of CFC were obtained with the CC cocktail. After cryopreservation and thawing the yield of CD34+ cells remained high, and a further reduction in the number of CD15+ cells was obtained. DISCUSSION: A method is described that allows the rapid and efficient debulking of large CML samples. This strategy will provide a source of well-characterized CML stem/progenitor cells that can be repeatedly accessed.","['Richmond, L J', 'Alcorn, M J', 'Pearson, C', 'Cameron, G', 'Thomas, T', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C', 'Holyoake, T L']","['Richmond LJ', 'Alcorn MJ', 'Pearson C', 'Cameron G', 'Thomas T', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC', 'Holyoake TL']","['Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cryopreservation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*therapy', 'Lewis X Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Cells/immunology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/05/29 05:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402320775991 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71078-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(5):407-13. doi: 10.1080/146532402320775991.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of TA-GVHD is difficult, and it is usually rapidly fatal. There are few documented sur- vivors of TA-GVHD. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was treated with fludarabine followed by combination chemotherapy and high-dose radioimmunotherapy and peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) rescue. She was transfused with nonirradiated blood components at an outside hospital and presented 10 days later with rash, elevated liver enzymes, and progressive pancytopenia. Skin biopsy was consistent with GVHD, and HLA typing of lymphocytes from the patient demonstrated mixed chimerism. The patient was treated with solumedrol and cyclosporin A, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin and autologous PBPC infusion. She had rapid engraftment, resolution of skin rash, and normalization of liver function abnormalities. She is in good health with normal blood counts and no evidence of CLL 34 months after transplantation. CONCLUSION: TA-GVHD occurs in the setting of an immunocompromised recipient receiving nonirradiated blood components. A typical presentation includes skin rash, liver function abnormalities, and pancytopenia. Demonstration of mixed chimerism by HLA typing facilitated diagnosis in this patient. High-dose immunosuppression, facilitated by the availability of autologous PBPCs, resulted in a successful outcome.","['Hutchinson, Kendra', 'Kopko, Patricia M', 'Muto, Kathryn N', 'Tuscano, Joseph', ""O'Donnell, Robert T"", 'Holland, Paul V', 'Richman, Carol', 'Paglieroni, Teresa G', 'Wun, Theodore']","['Hutchinson K', 'Kopko PM', 'Muto KN', 'Tuscano J', ""O'Donnell RT"", 'Holland PV', 'Richman C', 'Paglieroni TG', 'Wun T']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, University of California-Davis School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion/standards', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/03/26 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['trf253 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00253.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2002 Dec;42(12):1567-72. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00253.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the multifunctions of Zn, the intracellular Zn level is strictly regulated by a complex system in physiological and pathological conditions. The commitment of Zn to the regulation of apoptosis is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of intracellular Zn level in the induction of apoptosis in human leukemia cells (HL-60 cells) using a Zn ionophore [pyrithione (Py)]. Treatment of HL-60 cells with Zn for 6 h in the presence of Py (1 micro m) exhibited cytotoxicity in a Zn dose-dependent manner (25-200 micro m). Necrotic cells, assayed by trypan blue permeability, increased in number in a Zn dose-dependent fashion (50-100 micro m), but the appearance of apoptotic cells, assayed by formation of a DNA ladder and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling method, peaked at 25 micro m, suggesting the dependence of intracellular Zn level on the execution of apoptosis. In fact, treatment with Py resulted in increases in intracellular Zn levels, and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, a cell-permeable Zn chelator, inhibited DNA ladder formation induced by Py/Zn treatment (1 micro m Py and 25 micro m Zn). Py/Zn treatment activated the caspases, as assessed by the proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is a substrate of caspase, and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), which is a transducer of apoptotic stimuli to the apparatus of the apoptosis execution. Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspase, attenuated proteolysis of PARP and DNA ladder formation by Py/Zn, indicating that apoptosis induced by Py/Zn is mediated by caspase activation. The p38MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 also inhibited induction of apoptosis by Py/Zn. Although SB203580 suppressed the proteolysis of PARP, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, raising the possibility that apoptosis triggered by Py/Zn might be mediated by the p38MAPK/caspase pathway.","['Kondoh, Masuo', 'Tasaki, Emi', 'Araragi, Saeko', 'Takiguchi, Masufumi', 'Higashimoto, Minoru', 'Watanabe, Yoshiteru', 'Sato, Masao']","['Kondoh M', 'Tasaki E', 'Araragi S', 'Takiguchi M', 'Higashimoto M', 'Watanabe Y', 'Sato M']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Showa Pharmaceutical University, Machida, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thiones)', '6GK82EC25D (pyrithione)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Ionophores', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Necrosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Thiones', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3339 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03339.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Dec;269(24):6204-11. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03339.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from preliminary studies suggests that recombinant human glycosylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (lenograstim) increases the number and functionality of neutrophils in patients with severe aplastic anaemia. This randomized, parallel-group, multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous lenograstim during the first 12 weeks of standard immunosuppressive therapy in 102 patients with de novo severe aplastic anaemia. The addition of lenograstim to standard therapy resulted in an increase in the proportion of patients showing complete neutrophil response (83.0%vs 44.9%; P < 0.0001). This was seen even among patients with very severe aplastic anaemia (69.2%vs 31.6%; P = 0.012). In patients receiving lenograstim, median time to complete neutrophil response was shorter (6.3 vs 16.1 weeks; P = 0.0001) and mean duration of first neutrophil response was longer (P = 0.0248) than in the control group. At a median follow-up of 5 years, no difference was observed between the groups in term of survival, haematological response and occurrence of secondary leukaemia (one patient in each group). We conclude that lenograstim support of immunosuppressive therapy might be used for patients with severe aplastic anaemia as it significantly enhances neutrophil recovery but does not modify the overall response and survival.","['Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rokicka-Milewska, Riitta', 'Hann, Ian', 'Nikiforakis, Emmanouel', 'Tavakoli, Filipos', 'Cohen-Scali, Sophie', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea']","['Gluckman E', 'Rokicka-Milewska R', 'Hann I', 'Nikiforakis E', 'Tavakoli F', 'Cohen-Scali S', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. eliane.gluckman@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Opportunistic Infections/prevention & control', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3947 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03947.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(4):1075-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03947.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Working Party for Severe', 'Aplastic Anemia']",,,

Seven children had an isochromosome 7 [i(7)(q10)] and one a derivative chromosome 7, all with an apparently identical (centromeric) breakpoint. Children with SDS are predisposed to myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often with chromosome 7 abnormalities. Allogeneic transplants have been used to treat these children, however, they are a high-risk transplant group and require careful evaluation. Three of the children were transplanted but only one survived, who to our knowledge remains the longest surviving SDS transplant patient (4.5 years +). The six non-transplanted children are well. In classic MDS, chromosome 7 abnormalities are associated with rapid progression to acute leukaemia; however, we present evidence to suggest that isochromosome 7q may represent a separate disease entity in SDS children. This is a particularly interesting finding given that the SDS gene has recently been mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 7. Our studies indicate that i(7)(q10) is a relatively benign rearrangement and that it is not advisable to offer allogeneic transplants to SDS children with i(7)(q10) alone in the absence of other clinical signs of disease progression.","['Cunningham, Joan', 'Sales, Mark', 'Pearce, Andrew', 'Howard, Julie', 'Stallings, Ray', 'Telford, Nicholas', 'Wilkie, Rosalie', 'Huntly, Brian', 'Thomas, Angela', ""O'Marcaigh, Aengus"", 'Will, Andrew', 'Pratt, Norman']","['Cunningham J', 'Sales M', 'Pearce A', 'Howard J', 'Stallings R', 'Telford N', 'Wilkie R', 'Huntly B', 'Thomas A', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Will A', 'Pratt N']","['Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK. joancunningham66@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Failure to Thrive/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Isochromosomes/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Syndrome']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3940 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03940.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(4):1062-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03940.x.,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arrest of the cell cycle is mediated by retaining an inactivating state of phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) on tyrosine 15. Our data confirmed that cell survival in K562 was promoted by cell cycle arrest at G2M in response to the genotoxin etoposide. There was no predicted cell cycle arrest in Bcr-abl-positive derivative cell lines of K562 that did not survive the same genotoxic insult but, paradoxically, Cdk1 tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced to a higher extent compared with the parental cell line where arrest of the cell cycle was observed. To ascertain that this was not an anomaly of the derivative lines, HL60 cells were treated with concentrations of etoposide that induced arrest of the cell cycle or apoptosis. Only HL60 cells that subsequently underwent apoptosis elicited the same effect of increased Cdk1 tyrosine phosphorylation. It is proposed that the augmented tyrosine phosphorylation status of Cdk1 is associated with the abolition of cell survival, in addition to the previously reported induction of cell cycle arrest in myeloid cell lines.","['Higginbottom, Karen', 'Cummings, Michele', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Allen, Paul D']","['Higginbottom K', 'Cummings M', 'Newland AC', 'Allen PD']","[""Department of Haematology, Bart's and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3977 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03977.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(4):956-64. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03977.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A detailed three-colour cytometric analysis of peripheral lymphocytes was performed in 22 patients with chronic-phase CML (CP-CML). CD45 gating analysis was used to discriminate between lymphocytes and basophils. The peripheral lymphocyte pool was comprised of a significant proportion of naive CD4 cells, defined by a CD4+45RA+ phenotype [47.0 +/- 19.6% (mean +/- SD) of the total CD4+ cells], and naive CD8 cells, defined by a CD8+CD45RA+CD28+ phenotype (35.1 +/- 19.7% of total CD8+ cells), even in patients with long disease duration. The percentage of CD8 naive T cells showed inverse correlation with age, whereas no correlation was observed with disease duration. Possible explanations for the preservation of naive lymphocytes include (1) that the naive T cells differentiated from co-existing normal stem cells or (2) that long-lived naive T cells persisted from the CML onset and expanded peripherally (thymus independent). Either mechanism or a combination of both mechanisms might contribute to maintaining the naive compartment size.","['Isoda, Atsushi', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Matsushima, Takafumi', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Karasawa, Masamitsu']","['Isoda A', 'Yokohama A', 'Matsushima T', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Nojima Y', 'Karasawa M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine and Blood Transfusion Service, Gunma University School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3943 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03943.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(4):949-55. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03943.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RIZ gene encodes for two proteins, RIZ1 and RIZ2. While RIZ1 contains the PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homologous) domain, RIZ2 lacks it. RIZ gene expression is altered in a variety of human cancers and RIZ1 is now considered to be a candidate tumour suppressor. To investigate the role of RIZ in leukaemogenesis, we analysed the differential expression of RIZ1 and RIZ2 by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Our results showed that the expression of RIZ1 was significantly decreased in leukaemia cell lines (14 out of 17, 82%) and in patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (eight out of 14, 57%). In contrast, RIZ2 expression was increased in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (eight out of 11, 73%), compared with normal bone marrow cells. These findings indicate that suppression of RIZ1 expression or enhancement of RIZ2 expression may have an important role in leukaemogenesis.","['Sasaki, Osamu', 'Meguro, Kuniaki', 'Tohmiya, Yasuo', 'Funato, Tadao', 'Shibahara, Shigeki', 'Sasaki, Takeshi']","['Sasaki O', 'Meguro K', 'Tohmiya Y', 'Funato T', 'Shibahara S', 'Sasaki T']","['Department of Rheumatology and Hematology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (PRDM2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,2002/12/11 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/11 04:00'],"['2002/12/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['3972 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03972.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Dec;119(4):940-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03972.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of this genetic change has a unique significance as a result of its implication of poor prognosis. To reveal the utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detecting the MLL translocation, we analysed 289 consecutive Korean patients (children and adults) with acute leukaemias using both conventional cytogenetic analysis (CC) and FISH, placing an emphasis on the result discrepancies. Twenty-two of 289 patients (7.6%) had the 11q23/MLL translocation. In nine of 22 patients (41%), only FISH detected the translocation. In eight of these 22 patients, a total of 19 follow-up examinations were performed, of which FISH detected a significant level of leukaemic cells harbouring the MLL translocation in five patients (26%) without cytogenetic evidence. In addition to the MLL translocation, FISH detected submicroscopic amplification, partial deletion of the MLL gene and trisomy 11 in 12 patients without cytogenetic evidence. In summary, up to 41% of the MLL translocations at initial work-up and 26% during follow-up were detected by FISH without cytogenetic evidence.

Moreover, the beta(2)m-induced release of cytochrome c and AIF from the mitochondria in CCRF-HSB-2 cells was caspase-independent, since Z-VAD-fmk, a general inhibitor of caspases, did not block the release of these factors. However, Z-VAD-fmk treatment significantly blocked beta(2)m-induced apoptosis, while Western blot analysis revealed that caspases-1, -2, -3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 are not activated during beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in these cells. These results collectively indicate that a post-mitochondrial caspase-dependent mechanism is involved in beta(2)m-induced apoptosis. Moreover, beta(2)m significantly enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during 12-48 hr treatment, and beta(2)m-induced apoptosis was almost totally inhibited in cells pre-treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), providing evidence that beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in CCRF-HSB-2 cells is ROS-dependent. Therefore, these results reveal that beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in CCRF-HSB-2 cells may occur through an unknown caspase-dependent and ROS-dependent mechanism(s) that is associated with cytochrome c and AIF release from mitochondria, but is independent of the caspase -3, -8 and -9 pathways.","['Gordon, John', 'Wu, Ching-Huang', 'Rastegar, Mojgan', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Gordon J', 'Wu CH', 'Rastegar M', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Indiana University Cancer Center, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 80734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*pharmacology']",,2002/12/10 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10828 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jan 20;103(3):316-27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10828.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential impact that previously undescribed polymorphisms identified within NHEJ DNA ligase IV (LIG4) have upon predisposition to several lymphoproliferative disorders, including leukaemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Two LIG4 polymorphisms were examined, both C>T transitions, which result in the amino acid substitutions A3V and T9I. Inheritance of the LIG4 A3V CT genotype was found to be significantly associated with a two-fold reduction in risk of developing multiple myeloma (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89). Similarly, inheritance of the LIG4 T9I CT and the T9I TT genotypes were found to associate with a 1.5-fold reduction (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17) and a four-fold reduction (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70) in risk of developing multiple myeloma respectively, suggesting a gene dosage effect for this polymorphism. The LIG4 A3V and T9I variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium (D'=0.95, p<0.0001), and the protective effect associated with these polymorphisms was found to be the result of inheritance of the A3V-T9I CT and A3V-T9I TT haplotypes. These data suggest that genetic variants of NHEJ LIG4 may modulate predisposition to multiple myeloma, a tumour characterised by aberrant immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination.","['Roddam, P L', 'Rollinson, S', ""O'Driscoll, M"", 'Jeggo, P A', 'Jack, A', 'Morgan, G J']","['Roddam PL', 'Rollinson S', ""O'Driscoll M"", 'Jeggo PA', 'Jack A', 'Morgan GJ']","['Academic Unit of Haematology and Oncology, University of Leeds, Algernon Firth Building, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS2 9JT, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,"['0 (LIG4 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC1757220,2002/12/10 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jmg.39.12.900 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Genet. 2002 Dec;39(12):900-5. doi: 10.1136/jmg.39.12.900.,,,,,,,,,,,['RefSeq/NM_002312'],,,,,

Although diversifying (positive) Darwinian selection is thought to explain the origin and maintenance of MHC class I-a polymorphisms, genetic mechanisms underlying MHC class I-b evolution are uncertain. In one extreme model, MHC class I-b loci are derived by gene duplication from MHC class I-a alleles but rapidly drift into functional obsolescence and are eventually deleted. In this model, extant MHC class I-b genes are relatively young, tend to be dysfunctional or pseudogenic, and orthologies are restricted to close taxa. An alternative model proposed that the mouse MHC class I-b gene thymus leukemia Ag (TL) arose approximately 100 million years ago, near the time of the mammalian radiation. To determine the mode of evolution of TL, we cloned TL from genomic DNA of 11 species of subfamily Murinae: Every sample we tested contained TL, suggesting this molecule has been maintained throughout murine evolution. The sequence similarity of TL orthologs ranged from 85-99% and was inversely proportional to taxonomic distance. The sequences showed high conservation throughout the entire extracellular domains with exceptional conservation in the putative Ag recognition site. Our results strengthen the hypotheses that TL has evolved a specialized function and represents an ancient MHC class I-b gene.","['Davis, Beckley K', 'Cook, Richard G', 'Rich, Robert R', 'Rodgers, John R']","['Davis BK', 'Cook RG', 'Rich RR', 'Rodgers JR']","['Department of Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI18882/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI17897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI30036/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics/*immunology', 'Cytochrome b Group/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/*immunology', 'Muridae', 'Peromyscus', 'Phylogeny', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,2002/12/10 04:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.12.6890 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Dec 15;169(12):6890-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.12.6890.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY144125', 'GENBANK/AY144126', 'GENBANK/AY144127', 'GENBANK/AY144128', 'GENBANK/AY144129', 'GENBANK/AY144130', 'GENBANK/AY144131', 'GENBANK/AY144132', 'GENBANK/AY144133', 'GENBANK/AY144134', 'GENBANK/AY144135', 'GENBANK/AY144136', 'GENBANK/AY144137', 'GENBANK/AY144138', 'GENBANK/AY144139', 'GENBANK/AY144140', 'GENBANK/AY144141', 'GENBANK/AY144142', 'GENBANK/AY144143', 'GENBANK/AY144144', 'GENBANK/AY144145', 'GENBANK/AY144146', 'GENBANK/AY144147', 'GENBANK/AY144148', 'GENBANK/AY144149', 'GENBANK/AY144150', 'GENBANK/AY144151', 'GENBANK/AY144152', 'GENBANK/AY144153', 'GENBANK/AY144154', 'GENBANK/AY144155', 'GENBANK/AY144156', 'GENBANK/AY144157', 'GENBANK/AY144158', 'GENBANK/AY144159', 'GENBANK/AY144160', 'GENBANK/AY144161', 'GENBANK/AY144162', 'GENBANK/AY144163', 'GENBANK/AY144164', 'GENBANK/AY144165', 'GENBANK/AY144166', 'GENBANK/AY144167', 'GENBANK/AY144168', 'GENBANK/AY144169', 'GENBANK/AY144170', 'GENBANK/AY144171', 'GENBANK/AY144172', 'GENBANK/AY144173', 'GENBANK/AY144174', 'GENBANK/AY144175', 'GENBANK/AY144176', 'GENBANK/AY144177', 'GENBANK/AY144178', 'GENBANK/AY144179']",,,,,

NBS1, the protein responsible for NBS, forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50, and plays a vital role in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint, and telomere maintenance. Here, we show that a BRCA carboxyl terminus (BRCT) domain-containing region of NBS1 interacts with a nuclear dots-associated protein, SP100. The SP100 and NBS1 proteins co-localized in PODs and APBs in normal human fibroblast MRC5 and ALT line VA13 at G2 phase, respectively. Introduction of PML and SP100 into NT2 cells, which express no detectable amount of PML or SP100 proteins, resulted in localization of NBS1 in ectopically expressed PODs. These results indicate that NBS1 is recruited into PODs via interaction with SP100 protein. Thus, interaction between the NBS1 and SP100 proteins may be involved in genomic stability and telomere maintenance.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Ikeda, Kyoji', 'Motoyama, Noboru']","['Naka K', 'Ikeda K', 'Motoyama N']","['Department of Geriatric Research, National Institute for Longevity Sciences, 36-3 Gengo, Morioka, Obu, Aichi 474-8522, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Sp100 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2002/12/10 04:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02027559 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02755-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Dec 20;299(5):863-71. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02755-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During receptivity, the hairy-like epithelial cell microvilli transiently fuse to a single flower-like membrane projection called the 'pinopode'. Scanning electron microscopy in sequential endometrial biopsies shows that pinopodes appear about 1 week after ovulation, and they develop and regress within just 2 days. Interestingly, the cycle days when pinopodes appear can vary by up to 5 days between different individuals. On average, they occur on days 20-21 in natural cycles and earlier (days 19-20) in stimulated cycles. The abundance of pinopodes relates to implantation success and many patients with multiple implantation failures fail to produce pinopodes. Based on these findings, biopsies from candidate embryo recipients have been examined in mock cycles and pinopode numbers and timing of their appearance assessed. A similar cycle follows where embryos are replaced earlier or later, according to the reported timing of pinopode formation. If pinopodes are absent, the cycle can be modified. Accumulating evidence supports their clinical use as a marker to assess endometrial receptivity. Pinopode appearance, loss of steroid receptors and maximal expression of a(v)b(3) integrin, osteopontin and leukaemia inhibitory factor and receptor have been demonstrated in the same biopsy, showing a consistent association of pinopode appearance and other receptivity changes.","['Nikas, George', 'Aghajanova, Lusine']","['Nikas G', 'Aghajanova L']","['Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aretaieio University Hospital, Athens, Greece. yorgosnikas@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Reprod Biomed Online,Reproductive biomedicine online,101122473,['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Blastocyst/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometritis', 'Endometrium/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/10 04:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1472-6483(12)60111-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1472-6483(12)60111-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Biomed Online. 2002;4 Suppl 3:18-23. doi: 10.1016/s1472-6483(12)60111-4.,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to search for possible mechanisms of action of estrogen on bone. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice were treated with 17beta-estradiol. Possible effects of estrogen on the expression of 125 different bone-related genes in humerus were analyzed using the microarray technique. Estrogen regulated 12 of these genes, namely, two growth factor-related genes, 8 cytokines, and 2 bone matrix-related genes. Five of the 12 genes are known to be estrogen-regulated, and the remaining 7 genes are novel estrogen-regulated genes. Seven genes, including interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-1receptor type II (IL-1RII), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), and soluble IL-4 receptor (sIL-4R) were selected as probable candidate genes for the trabecular bone-sparing effect of estrogen, as the mRNA levels of these genes were highly correlated (r2 > 0.65) to the trabecular BMD. The regulation of most of these seven genes was predominantly estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha)-mediated (5/7) while some genes (2/7) were regulated both via ER-alpha and ER-beta. In conclusion, by using the microarray technique, we have identified four previously known and three novel estrogen-regulated genes of potential importance for the trabecular bone-sparing effect of estrogen.","['Lindberg, Marie K', 'Moverare, Sofia', 'Eriksson, Anna-Lena', 'Skrtic, Stanko', 'Gao, Hui', 'Dahlman-Wright, Karin', 'Gustafsson, Jan-Ake', 'Ohlsson, Claes']","['Lindberg MK', 'Moverare S', 'Eriksson AL', 'Skrtic S', 'Gao H', 'Dahlman-Wright K', 'Gustafsson JA', 'Ohlsson C']","['Center for Bone Research at the Sahlgrenska Academy, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Goteborgs Universitet.

Based on analysis of cytogenetic and molecular data, it is known that leukemic cells in older patients are intrinsically resistant to standard chemotherapy. Due to comorbid disease and impaired bone marrow stem cell reserve, older adults tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy poorly, with a treatment-related mortality rate of 25 percent. About 35 percent of adults under age 40 are cured, but the complete remission rate (likelihood of temporary disease eradication) is 45 percent in those over age 60, considerably lower than the 75% rate among younger patients, and the possibility of long-term disease free survival is 20 percent in those achieving remission or less than 10 percent overall. Standard allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is too dangerous to be considered as a means to eradicate minimal residual disease after remission is obtained and myelointensive chemotherapy is not a beneficial post-remission strategy in this age cohort. These disappointing results call for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML and promising early clinical data suggest that the era of truly targeted therapy in this difficult disease may soon be a reality.","['Stone, Richard M']",['Stone RM'],"['Adult Acute Leukemia Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2002/12/10 04:00,2002/12/21 04:00,['2002/12/10 04:00'],"['2002/12/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.3322/canjclin.52.6.363 [doi]'],ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 2002 Nov-Dec;52(6):363-71. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.52.6.363.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After infection in human the virus enters into a latent state, in which very low viral gene expression can be detected. On the other hand several major characteristics of ATL and TSP/HAM indicate that their genesis requires activation of the dormant virus. TSP/HAM is characterized by high virus expression, which accounts for most of its immunopathological manifestations, whereas the process leading to ATL is believed to be initiated by the viral Tax protein, implying that it requires, at least, a temporary activation of the latent virus. Data from our and other laboratories suggest that this activation may likely be induced by environmental or/and intrinsic apoptosis-inducing factors. Moreover, we have demonstrated a mechanistic linkage between the activation of the viral promoter and the early stage of the apoptotic cascade.

This suggests that Tax protein, emerging after activation of the latent virus, can rescue the host cells of the activated virus from the ultimate apoptotic death.

Eleven out of 12 patients with refractory anemia (RA) (91.6%), and all 3 patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) (100%), were positive for survivin expression with the majority of cases showing abundant levels of the survivin transcript. On the other hand, expression of survivin was undetectable in the 4 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). The level and frequency of survivin expression in patients with refractory anemia were compared to those in patients with AML. Out of 12 patients with de novo AML, 5 patients (41.7%) showed detectable levels of survivin expression. Abundant survivin expression in RA was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, survivin was almost absent in two cases with aplastic anemia.

In addition, a pore-forming protein perforin, was also up-regulated. Northern blot analysis and RNase protection assays (RPA) confirmed that these genes were over-expressed in the majority of samples from LGL leukemia patients.

METHODS: All children and young adults (n = 241) undergoing first myeloablative transplant at the UCSF Pediatric BMT unit between 1992 and 2000 were included. Retrospective chart review was done. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors are presented. RESULTS: Venoocclusive disease developed in 65 patients (27%); it was severe in 13/65 patients (20%). Matched unrelated donor transplantation, advanced-stage malignancies, and transplantation in the recent period (1998-2000) were identified as significant risk factors for VOD in univariate and multivariate analyses. Heparin prophylaxis did not decrease the incidence of VOD. Venoocclusive disease was diagnosed at a median day 8 after BMT. Five of 13 patients with severe VOD (38%) survived for more than 1 year after BMT, even after renal and respiratory failure and high total bilirubin levels up to 35 mg/dL. Nine of the 13 patients received fibrinolytic treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, anti-thrombin 3, or defibrotide. The survival rate at day 100 after BMT for children with VOD was 77%; it was 94% for those without VOD. CONCLUSIONS: The persistently high incidence of VOD, its significant impact on posttransplant survival, and the demonstration of recovery from even severe VOD underscore the importance of early diagnosis and initiation of specific therapy. The use of Bearman's model of prediction of severity of VOD and the application of fibrinolytic drugs when adequate are highly recommended.","['Reiss, Ulrike', 'Cowan, Morton', 'McMillan, Alex', 'Horn, Biljana']","['Reiss U', 'Cowan M', 'McMillan A', 'Horn B']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Transfusion', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*blood/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/complications/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200212000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Dec;24(9):746-50. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200212000-00013.,,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Dec;24(9):706-9.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 1994 and July 1998, 103 patients with cancer were randomized at the time of subcutaneous CVC placement to receive monthly flushing of their catheters with either 5000 IU of urokinase-heparin or heparin alone. Patients subsequently had blood cultures taken from their CVCs during an episode of fever. RESULTS: Seventy-four of the 103 patients (72%) enrolled in the study received at least 6 catheter flushes: 40 with urokinase-heparin and 34 with heparin. The median number of flushes was 9.5 in the urokinase-heparin group and 10.2 in the heparin-only group (P = 0.62). There were 5 positive blood cultures in the urokinase-heparin group and seven in patients receiving heparin alone (P = 0.27). Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from the blood of 3 patients receiving urokinase-heparin and 6 in those receiving heparin alone (P = 0.17).

Biologic and epidemiologic data implicate exogenous toxicants, including cytotoxic drugs, benzene, radiation, and cigarette smoking. Allelic variation in genes encoding enzymes such as NADP(H) quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) that metabolize environmental toxicants predispose to subtypes of AML, including therapy-related AML. We assayed NRAS oncogene mutation and FLT3 internal tandem duplication in 447 AML patients with an abnormal karyotype treated in Medical Research Council (MRC) AML clinical trials. Functional allelic variant frequencies in genes encoding carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes GSTT1, GSTM1, CYP1A1, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, SULT1A1, and NQO1 were previously determined for this cohort. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) frequency was 17%, and NRAS mutation 12% for the entire cohort. The 2 mutations were found together in only 4 patients. No association was found between enzyme allelic variant frequencies and the presence of FLT3 ITD for the entire cohort or within cytogenetic subgroups. CYP1A1*2B (Val) high-inducibility variant allele was overrepresented in patients with NRAS mutation compared with no mutation, for (1) the entire AML cohort (n = 8/53 vs 26/371; odds ratio [OR] = 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-5.53) and (2) the poor-risk karyotype group (n = 6/14 vs 4/89; OR = 15.94; 95% CI 3.71-68.52) comprising patients with partial/complete deletion of chromosome 5 or 7, or abnormalities of chromosome 3. The CYP1A1*2B allele may predispose to the development of these subgroups of AML by augmented phase 1 metabolism to highly reactive intermediates of CYP1A1 substrates, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or by generation of oxidative stress as a metabolic by-product.","['Bowen, David T', 'Frew, Marion E', 'Rollinson, Sara', 'Roddam, Philippa L', 'Dring, Ann', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Langabeer, Stephen E', 'Morgan, Gareth J']","['Bowen DT', 'Frew ME', 'Rollinson S', 'Roddam PL', 'Dring A', 'Smith MT', 'Langabeer SE', 'Morgan GJ']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom. d.t.bowen@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0228 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51169-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2770-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0228.

The primary measure was the PML-RAR alpha(GAPDH) normalized quotient (NQ), that is, PML-RAR alpha mRNA copies divided by glyceraldehyde-3'-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA copies. Only samples with more than 2.5 x 10(5) copies of the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA (detection sensitivity exceeding 10(4)) were considered NQ evaluable. With RNA from low-density selected cells, paired peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow samples (n = 140) had comparable NQs (P <.001). Before treatment, high NQ was associated with short-form PML-RAR alpha (P <.001), but not with white blood cell count or clinical outcome. Following treatment, NQ was lower in all-trans retinoic acid-induced complete remission (CR) than chemotherapy-induced CR (P =.018) and at first test after consolidation chemotherapy (P =.037). After consolidation chemotherapy, patients with NQ exceeding 10(-5) had 4.1-fold increased relapse risk (P =.008); however, 73% of patients who experienced relapse had NQ lower than 10(-5). In the follow-up period (FUP), any NQ exceeding 10(-5) and 10(-6) had 17.5-fold and 7.6-fold increased relapse risk, respectively (P <.001), while no gradation of relapse risk (approximately 18%) could be identified at NQ lower than 10(-6), including NQ(-). These results indicate that qrtPCR monitoring of PML-RAR alpha NQ can identify patients at high risk of relapse and suggest that clinically practical PB NQ monitoring at more frequent FUP intervals may improve predictive accuracy for relapse or continuing CR in patients with persistent, fluctuating minimal residual disease levels.","['Gallagher, Robert E', 'Yeap, Beow Y', 'Bi, Wanli', 'Livak, Kenneth J', 'Beaubier, Nike', 'Rao, Sreenivas', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Slack, James L', 'Willman, Cheryl L']","['Gallagher RE', 'Yeap BY', 'Bi W', 'Livak KJ', 'Beaubier N', 'Rao S', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Tallman MS', 'Slack JL', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Oncology and Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA. rgallagh@aecom.yu.edu']",['eng'],"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1357 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51134-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2521-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1357.

Inhibition of this expression can lead to the differentiation and reduced growth of leukemia cells and cell lines, suggesting that WT1 participates in regulating the proliferation of leukemic cells. However, the role of WT1 in normal hematopoiesis is not well understood. To investigate this question, we have used murine cells in which the WT1 gene has been inactivated by homologous recombination. We have found that cells lacking WT1 show deficits in hematopoietic stem cell function. Embryonic stem cells lacking WT1, although contributing efficiently to other organ systems, make only a minimal contribution to the hematopoietic system in chimeras, indicating that hematopoietic stem cells lacking WT1 compete poorly with healthy stem cells. In addition, fetal liver cells lacking WT1 have an approximately 75% reduction in erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-E), erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-E), and colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage-erythroid-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM). However, transplantation of fetal liver hematopoietic cells lacking WT1 will repopulate the hematopoietic system of an irradiated adult recipient in the absence of competition. We conclude that the absence of WT1 in hematopoietic cells leads to functional defects in growth potential that may be of consequence to leukemic cells that have alterations in the expression of WT1.","['Alberta, Julia A', 'Springett, Gregory M', 'Rayburn, Helen', 'Natoli, Thomas A', 'Loring, Janet', 'Kreidberg, Jordan A', 'Housman, David']","['Alberta JA', 'Springett GM', 'Rayburn H', 'Natoli TA', 'Loring J', 'Kreidberg JA', 'Housman D']","['Center for Cancer Research, the Department of Biology, and the Whitehead Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA.']",['eng'],"['2-PO1-CA42063-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG00061/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chimera', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'WT1 Proteins/*physiology']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1656 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51142-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2570-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1656.

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor occur in 25% of AML cases. Previously, we have shown that these mutations activate the receptor and induce leukemic transformation. In this study, we performed genome-wide parallel expression analyses of 32Dcl3 cells stably transfected with either wild-type or 3 different ITD isoforms of Flt3. Comparison of microarray expression analyses revealed that 767 of 6586 genes differed in expression between FLT3-WT- and FLT3-ITD-expressing cell lines. The target genes of mutationally activated Flt3 resembled more closely those of the interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor than those of ligand-activated Flt3. The serine-threonine kinase Pim-2 was up-regulated on the mRNA and the protein level in Flt3-ITD-expressing cells. Further experiments indicated that Pim-2 function was important for clonal growth of 32D cells. Several genes repressed by the mutations were found to be involved in myeloid gene regulation. Pu.1 and C/EBPalpha, both induced by ligand-activation of wild-type Flt3, were suppressed in their expression and function by the Flt3 mutations. In conclusion, internal tandem duplication mutations of Flt3 activate transcriptional programs that partially mimic IL-3 activity. Interestingly, other parts of the transcriptional program involve novel, IL-3-independent pathways that antagonize differentiation-inducing effects of wild-type Flt3.

In the current study, (3)H-thymidine ((3)H-Tdr) suicide assays demonstrated that most NOD/SCID mouse leukemia-initiating cells (NOD/SL-ICs) are quiescent in 6 of 7 AML samples. AML cells in G(0), G(1), and S/G(2)+M were isolated from 4 of these samples using Hoechst 33342/pyroninY staining and cell sorting. The progenitor content of each subpopulation was consistent with the (3)H-Tdr suicide results, with NOD/SL-ICs found almost exclusively among G(0) cells while the cycling status of AML CFCs and LTC-ICs was more heterogeneous. Interestingly, after 72 hours in serum-free culture with or without Steel factor (SF), Flt-3 ligand (FL), and interleukin-3 (IL-3), most G(0) AML cells entered active cell cycle (percentage of AML cells remaining in G(0) at 72 hours, 1.2% to 37%, and 0% to 7.6% in cultures without and with growth factors [GFs], respectively) while G(0) cells from normal lineage-depleted bone marrow remained quiescent in the absence of GF. All 4 AML samples showed evidence of autocrine production of 2 or more of SF, FL, IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, 3 of 4 samples contained an internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene. In summary, quiescent leukemic cells, including NOD/SL-ICs, are present in most AML patients. Their spontaneous entry into active cell cycle in short-term culture might be explained by the deregulated GF signaling present in many AMLs.","['Guan, Yinghui', 'Gerhard, Brigitte', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Guan Y', 'Gerhard B', 'Hogge DE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and the Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology/transplantation', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3062 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50814-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 15;101(8):3142-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3062.

The existence of periodicity was demonstrated clearly in both PTP and PTK enzyme activities and in the amount of protein extracted from the cells. Following ATRA treatment, differentiation-induced changes in rhythmic characteristics such as period and amplitude were evident. A noticeable effect was that of ATRA on the enzyme activity of PTP, for which four distinct patterns of oscillatory behaviour were identified.

Breast cancer has a tendency to metastasize to the bone marrow, and live tumor cells are known to circulate in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients. Sensitive immunohistochemical, culture-based, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods have shown that about 50% of histologically normal stem cell grafts from breast cancer patients are contaminated with occult tumor cells, which may cause or contribute to tumor recurrences. Merocyanine 540 (MC540)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) inactivates a wide range of leukemia and lymphoma cells and is well tolerated by normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Unfortunately, most solid tumor cells (including breast cancer cells) are only moderately sensitive or refractory to MC540-PDT. We report here that if MC540-PDT is followed by a 1-h incubation with the alkyl-lysophospholipid, Edelfosine (ET-18-OCH(3)), the depletion of murine and human breast cancer cells is greatly enhanced whereas the recovery of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is only minimally degraded.

In this review, diagnostic problems, clinical and histopathological features, and treatment strategies of EBV-HLH have been described. In patients with EBV-HLH, the EBV-infected T cells or natural killer (NK) cells are mostly mono- or oligo-clonally proliferating, where hypercytokinemia plays a major role and causes hemophagocytosis, cellular damage and dysfunction of various organs. Although the majority of EBV-HLH cases develop in apparently immunocompetent children and adolescents, it also occurs in association with infectious mononucleosis, chronic active EBV infection, familial HLH, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease like peripheral T-cell lymphoma and NK cell leukemia. In terms of treatment, special therapeutic measures are required to control the cytokine storm generated by EBV and to suppress proliferating EBV-genome-containing cells, because the clinical courses are often fulminant and result in a poor outcome.","['Imashuku, Shinsaku']",['Imashuku S'],"['Kyoto City Institute of Health and Environmental Sciences, 1-2 Higashi-Takada-cho, Mibu, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto 604-8854, Japan. shinim95@mbox.kyoto-inet.or.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1040842802001178 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00117-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2002 Dec;44(3):259-72. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00117-8.,,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of possible changes in bone status in survivors of ALL. The studied population consisted of 54 subjects aged 13.0 +/- 3.3 years (31 girls and 23 boys). The mean age at diagnosis was 5.5 +/- 3.5 years, age at the completion of therapy was 8.4 +/- 3.5 years, and the period of follow-up was 4.6 +/- 3.4 years. Patients were divided into three subgroups (low-, moderate- and high-risk) according to the presence of risk factors of ALL and compared with 1020 healthy subjects (508 girls and 512 boys). Patients and controls did not differ significantly in regard to age, height, or weight. Bone status was assessed by quantitative ultrasound (US) at right (dominant) hand phalanges using DBM Sonic 1200 (IGEA, Carpi, Italy) that measures amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS, m/s). Root mean square (RMS)_CV% was 0.43%. Mean Ad-SoS values were 2018 +/- 73 m/s in patients and 2003 +/- 80 m/s in controls and did not differ significantly. Ad-SoS tended to be lower in moderate- and high-risk patients, but differences were not significant. Ad-SoS correlated significantly with age in patients (r value ranged from 0.63 to 0.77, p < 0.01) and controls (r value ranged from 0.79 to 0.84, p < 0.0001). In multiple forward regression analysis, the following equation was obtained: Ad-SoS (m/s) = 1878 (m/s) + 11.4 x age at the study (y) + 4.0 x period after therapy completion (y) - 9.5 x duration of the therapy (y). It can be concluded that bone status assessed by quantitative US at the hand phalanges in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 4.6 years after completion of the therapy is not affected in comparison to healthy controls.","['Pluskiewicz, W', 'Luszczynska, A', 'Halaba, Z', 'Drozdzowska, B', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, D']","['Pluskiewicz W', 'Luszczynska A', 'Halaba Z', 'Drozdzowska B', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D']","['Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit -Department and Clinic of Internal Medicine, Diabetology and Nephrology, Silesian School of Medicine, Zabrze, Poland. osteolesna@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ultrasound Med Biol,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,0410553,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Density', 'Bone and Bones/*diagnostic imaging', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Fingers', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/therapy', '*Survivors', 'Ultrasonography']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301562902004908 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-5629(02)00490-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrasound Med Biol. 2002 Oct;28(10):1279-84. doi: 10.1016/s0301-5629(02)00490-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported an improvement in the histology of mdx diaphragms after delivery of leukaemia inhibitory factor in a similar manner, but little attention has been paid to the mechanism by which leukaemia inhibitory factor acts. We have used autoradiography to examine cell proliferation, Evans Blue Dye to examine myofibre damage, and morphometric analysis to examine histology in leukaemia-inhibitory-factor-treated diaphragms and compared them with untreated mdx and normal C57Bl10/ScSn diaphragms. Autoradiography showed that although myoblast proliferation was significantly increased in leukaemia inhibitory factor-treated mdx diaphragms, leukaemia inhibitory factor did not reduce myofibre damage and no histological improvement was observed.

NAD performs pleiotropic and essential cellular functions, both as a cofactor in oxidation-reduction reactions and as a substrate for poly- and mono-ADP-ribosylation reactions. The therapeutic potential of modulating intracellular NAD levels and activity of NAD-dependent enzymes by concomitant administration of conventional anticancer agents merits further research. Our aim was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of Tz and Se in hematopoietic cells and to test their ability to potentiate the effects of DNA strand-disrupting agents. MATERIAL: THP-1, a cell line, derived from human acute monoblastic leukemia, was used. CLL lymphocytes were obtained from 8 patients with CLL. METHODS: The WST-l test was used to detect the function of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases after exposure of THP-1 cells to Tz or Se. Cytotoxicity of Tz, Se, MNNG and chlorambucil was assessed using the membrane permeability assay (PI test). RESULTS: THP-1 cells were sensitive to cytotoxic effects of Tz and Se, with IC50 values of 2.5 x 10(-5) M for Tz and 2 x 10(-6) M for Se, as determined with the WST-1 test; 10 microM Se induced cell membrane disruption in more than 20% of THP-1 cells 48 hours after commencement of treatment, whereas the same concentration of Tz failed to increase membrane permeability. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with 0.5 - 1.5 microM Se had no effect on the time course of cell death, induced by treatment with the DNA-damaging agent 1-methyl-3-nitro-1 - nitrosoguanidinium (MNNG) for 36 hours. However, when incubation of THP-1 cells with MNNG was prolonged (72 hours) without changing the incubation medium, pretreatment with Se had the following effects: the relative number of cells that died spontaneously decreased, and the cytotoxicity of MNNG was diminished. This effect was also demonstrated ex vivo in 6 of 8 cases of CLL, treated with MNNG and chlorambucil. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to other investigations, we here demonstrate that preincubation with Se may partially protect cells from cell death induced by the alkylating agents MNNG and chlorambucil in the THP-1 cell line and in CLL lymphocytes presumably by affecting spontaneous cell death.","['Pogrebniak, A', 'Hasmann, M', 'Schemainda, I', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Nuessler, V']","['Pogrebniak A', 'Hasmann M', 'Schemainda I', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Nuessler V']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Forschungslabor A, Klinikum Grosshadem, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'I5R2V02E8Z (selenazofurin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp40368 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2002 Aug;40(8):368-75. doi: 10.5414/cpp40368.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Activation of the coagulation system has been examined in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) before and after chemotherapy as well as in malignant effusions of heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors. Thrombin receptor expression (PAR-I) has been examined on HL-60 cells; the effect ofthrombin on the proliferation of the cells and inhibition of apoptosis induction by idarubicin has been shown. RESULTS: Using fibrinopeptide A as an indirect parameter for thrombin activation, we found elevated levels in patients with AML and NHL before and a significant 2-fold increase after chemotherapy (p < 0.02 for the AML group; p < 0.0006 for the NHL group). Apparently, this does not only affect patients with hematological diseases, but also with solid tumors. In order to find out if the tumor cells directly activate thrombin, we examined malignant effusions of patients with different solid tumors. Comparing prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 in ascites and pleural effusions with the patients' serum levels, we found it significantly increased in all cases (mean of 1.96 +/- 0.5 nmol/l in the serum vs. 12.1 +/- 3.6 nmol/l in effusions; p < 0.001). The majority of patients presented elevated serum levels. Additionally, we incubated HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia) with thrombin prior to treatment with idarubicin. Expression of thrombin receptor (PAR-1) could be verified by FACS-analysis using a monoclonal antibody. HL-60 cells responded with increased proliferation to thrombin exposure with concentrations between 0.3 and 3 U/ml. This effect could be abolished by the addition of hirudin, demonstrating thrombin specificity. In these concentrations, thrombin was able to abrogate the induction of apoptosis by idarubicin completely (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Here we give evidence for the role of thrombin as a resistance factor for tumor cells towards chemotherapy. In the light of the fact that thrombin is regularly activated in cancer patients, these findings indicate that thrombin is a clinically relevant cellular resistance factor. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies imply that inhibition of the coagulation system, e.g. by low-molecular weight heparins or warfarin, increases the effect of chemotherapy.","['Schiller, H', 'Bartscht, T', 'Arlt, A', 'Zahn, M O', 'Seifert, A', 'Bruhn, T', 'Bruhn, H D', 'Gieseler, F']","['Schiller H', 'Bartscht T', 'Arlt A', 'Zahn MO', 'Seifert A', 'Bruhn T', 'Bruhn HD', 'Gieseler F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Hirudins)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-1)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hirudins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Receptor, PAR-1/metabolism', 'Thrombin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp40329 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2002 Aug;40(8):329-35. doi: 10.5414/cpp40329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred and twenty-eight cases and 315 controls (78% of participants) had medical records available from an average of 71% of providers. Proxies were used for 49% of cases because of rapid fatality. Mean agreement (number of procedures in medical records subtracted from number in interview) showed similar levels of overreporting in cases [0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 1.1] and controls (0.7; CI: 0.2, 1.3) with few procedures (<= 10). Most participants with more procedures underreported exposure, and underreporting increased with increasing exposure, especially among cases [mean (CI) agreement = -2.1 (-4.3, 0.0) for 11-20 procedures, -6.4 (-13.6, 0.7) for >20 procedures] and case proxies. High-dose, fluoroscopic, and non-routine procedures were self-reported more accurately than low-dose, non-fluoroscopic, and routine procedures, respectively (p < 0.01 for each comparison), and tended to be underreported. Case-control differences in agreement were non-significant for these categories of procedures. We conclude that diagnostic imaging procedures of most interest to the AML-radiography hypothesis are self-reported accurately but that underreporting does occur and might lead to attenuated risk estimates.","['Pogoda, Janice M', 'Preston-Martin, Susan']","['Pogoda JM', 'Preston-Martin S']","['Statology, Rocklin, CA 96161, USA. jpogoda@statology.com']",['eng'],"['5 P30 ES07048-06/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-25403/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', '*Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging', '*Medical Records', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-200212000-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2002 Dec;83(6):907-17. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200212000-00019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greatest potentiation was observed with the alkylating camptothecin CMMDC. Buthionine sulfoximine pretreatment also increased the number of camptothecin-induced DNA-protein crosslinks, indicating that GSH affects the mechanism of action of camptothecin. We also report that GSH interacts with CMMDC to form a stable conjugate, 7-(glutathionylmethyl)-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin (GSMMDC), which is formed spontaneously in buffered solutions and in MCF-7 cells treated with CMMDC. GSMMDC was synthesized and found to be nearly as active as 10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin in a topoisomerase (topo) I-mediated DNA nicking assay. The resulting topo I cleavage complexes were remarkably stable. In cell culture, GSMMDC displayed potent growth-inhibitory activity against U937 and P388 leukemia cell lines. GSMMDC was not active against a topo I-deficient P388 cell line, indicating that topo I is its cellular target. Peptide-truncated analogues of GSMMDC were prepared and evaluated. All three derivatives [7-(gamma-glutamylcysteinylmethyl)-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin, 7-(cysteinylglycylmethyl)-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin, and 7-(cysteinylmethyl)-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin] displayed topo I and cell growth-inhibitory activity.

Isobologram analysis of cytotoxicity assays revealed that there is a synergistic interaction between the two agents in both cell lines.

In addition, Annexin V apoptotic studies revealed that lovastatin enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Lovastatin did not affect levels of [3H]paclitaxel in cells. Whereas lovastatin induced an accumulation of unmodified Ras and caused an up-regulation of both RhoB and Rap1A, paclitaxel was found to have no effect on the isoprenylated proteins. Studies of the centromere-associated protein mitosin revealed that treatment with lovastatin and paclitaxel resulted in increased mitosin levels and that lovastatin altered the association of mitosin with condensed chromosomes.

This observation has now been extended to other short chain fatty acids and aromatic butyrate analogues, and evidence is presented that human topo II alpha promoter induction correlates closely with histone H4 acetylation status. Because increased topo II alpha expression is associated with enhanced efficacy of topo II-poisoning antitumor drugs such as etoposide, the hypothesis tested in this report was whether NaB pretreatment could sensitize HL-60 myeloid leukemia and K562 erythroleukemia cells to etoposide-triggered DNA damage and cell death. A 24-72 h NaB treatment (0.4-0.5 mM) induced topo II alpha 2-2.5-fold in both HL-60 and K562 cells and caused a dose-dependent enhancement of etoposidestimulated, protein-linked DNA complexes in both cell lines. At concentrations with minimal effects on cell cycle kinetics (0.4 mM in HL-60; 0.5 mM in K562), NaB pretreatment also modestly enhanced etoposidetriggered apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as determined morphologically after acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, and substantially increased K562 growth inhibition and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage after etoposide exposure. Therefore, a temporal window may exist whereby a differentiating agent may sensitize experimental leukemias to a cytotoxic antitumor agent. These results indicate that histone deacetylase inhibitors should be investigated for etoposide sensitization of other butyrate-responsive hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor lines in vitro and in vivo.","['Kurz, E U', 'Wilson, S E', 'Leader, K B', 'Sampey, B P', 'Allan, W P', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Kroll, D J']","['Kurz EU', 'Wilson SE', 'Leader KB', 'Sampey BP', 'Allan WP', 'Yalowich JC', 'Kroll DJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA074972-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/01/28 04:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2001 Dec;1(2):121-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the cell cycle checkpoint abrogator, UCN-01, was reported to inhibit nucleotide excision repair in cell-free systems. We hypothesized that if UCN-01 was combined with DNA-damaging agents, UCN-01 might inhibit the damage repair processes, thereby enhancing cytotoxicity in quiescent cells. Here, we investigated the effect of UCN-01 on DNA repair and viability of quiescent normal lymphocytes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes treated with UV or the cyclophosphamide prodrug 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). DNA damage repair kinetics were determined as DNA single strand breaks by the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay and by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Pretreatment with UCN-01 inhibited DNA repair initiated by UV or 4-HC in normal lymphocytes as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent manner at clinically relevant levels (50-300 nM). This inhibition was demonstrated by the decreases in incision capability, DNA resynthesis, and in rejoining, suggesting that UCN-01 inhibits the multiple sites of the repair processes. The higher UCN-01 concentration (300 nM) maximized the inhibitory effects and enhanced the UV- or 4-HC-induced cytotoxicity, as determined by annexin V binding or Hoechst 33342 staining. This enhancement was not obtained by the lower concentrations that incompletely inhibited the repair, suggesting the close association between the inhibition of the repair and the enhancement of the cytotoxicity.

Whereas 1 mM of SB or 100 nM of FP minimally induced apoptosis (4% and 10%, respectively) at 24 h, simultaneous exposure of U937 cells to these agents dramatically increased cell death (e.g., approximately 60%), reflected by both morphological and Annexin/propidium iodide-staining features, procaspase 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Similar interactions were observed in human promyelocytic (HL-60), B-lymphoblastic (Raji), and T-lymphoblastic (Jurkat) leukemia cells. Coadministration of FP opposed SB-mediated accumulation of cells in G0G1 and differentiation, reflected by reduced CD11b expression, but instead dramatically increased procaspase-3, procaspase-8, Bid, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, as well as mitochondrial damage (e.g., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release). FP also blocked SB-related p21WAF1-CIP1 induction through a caspase-independent mechanism and triggered the caspase-mediated cleavage of p27KIP1 and retinoblastoma protein. The latter event was accompanied by a marked reduction in retinoblastoma protein/E2F1 complex formation. However, FP did not modify the extent of SB-associated acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Treatment of cells with FP/SB also resulted in the caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 and caspase-independent down-regulation of Mcl-1. Levels of cyclins A, D1, and E, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis also declined in SB/FP-treated cells. Finally, FP/SB coexposure potently induced apoptosis in two primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples. Together, these findings demonstrate that FP, when combined with SB, induces multiple perturbations in cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, which oppose leukemic cell differentiation but instead promote mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Cartee, Leanne', 'Betts, Vicki', 'Chellappan, Srikumar P', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Cartee L', 'Betts V', 'Chellappan SP', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, MCV Station, Box 230, Richmond, VA 23298, USA. stgrant@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/01/11 04:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2002 Feb;1(4):253-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe studies on the antitumor activity of a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor, ER-37328 [12,13-dihydro-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-4H-benzo[c]pyrimido[5,6,1- jk]carbazole-4,6,10(5H,11H)-trione hydrochloride]. ER-37328 inhibited topoisomerase II activity at 10 times lower concentration than etoposide in relaxation assay and induced double-strand DNA cleavage within 1 h in murine leukemia P388 cells, in a bell-shaped manner with respect to drug concentration. The maximum amount of DNA cleavage was obtained at 2 microM. Like etoposide, ER-37328 (2 microM) induced topoisomerase II-DNA cross-linking in P388 cells. A spectroscopic study of ER-37328 mixed with DNA demonstrated that ER-37328 has apparent binding activity to DNA. ER-37328 showed potent growth-inhibitory activity against a panel of 21 human cancer cell lines [mean (50% growth-inhibitory concentration) GI50 = 59 nM]. COMPARE analysis according to the National Cancer Institute screening protocol showed that the pattern of the growth-inhibitory effect of ER-37328 was similar to that of etoposide, but different from that of doxorubicin. Studies on etoposide-, amsacrine [4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA)]-, and camptothecin-resistant P388 cell lines showed that: (a) etoposide- and m-AMSA-resistant P388 cell lines were partially resistant to ER-37328 compared with the parental cell line; and (b) a camptothecin-resistant cell line showed no cross-resistance to ER-37328. In addition, ER-37328 overcame P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance. In vivo, ER-37328 produced potent tumor regression of Colon 38 carcinoma inoculated s.c., and its activity was superior to that of etoposide or doxorubicin. These results indicate that ER-37328 inhibits topoisomerase II activity through the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex and has potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.","['Nakamura, Katsuji', 'Sugumi, Hiroyuki', 'Yamaguchi, Atsumi', 'Uenaka, Toshimitsu', 'Kotake, Yoshihiko', 'Okada, Toshimi', 'Kamata, Junichi', 'Niijima, Jun', 'Nagasu, Takeshi', 'Koyanagi, Nozomu', 'Yoshino, Hiroshi', 'Kitoh, Kyosuke', 'Yoshimatsu, Kentaro']","['Nakamura K', 'Sugumi H', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Uenaka T', 'Kotake Y', 'Okada T', 'Kamata J', 'Niijima J', 'Nagasu T', 'Koyanagi N', 'Yoshino H', 'Kitoh K', 'Yoshimatsu K']","['Discovery Research Laboratories II (Oncology), Tsukuba Research Laboratories, Eisai Co.

Increased acetylation of histones was induced by incubation of cells with the allyl compounds at concentrations similar to those that resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation. The induction of histone acetylation by S-allylmercaptocysteine was also observed in Caco-2 human colon cancer cells and T47D human breast cancer cells. In contrast to the effect on histone acetylation, there was a decrease in the incorporation of phosphate into histones when DS19 cells were incubated with 25 microM S-allylmercaptocysteine. Histone deacetylase activity was inhibited by allyl butyrate, but there was little or no effect with the allyl sulfur compounds examined in this study. A similar degree of downregulation of histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase was observed when DS19 cells were incubated with S-allylmercaptocysteine or allyl isothiocyanate. The induction of histone acetylation by S-allylmercaptocysteine was not blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. The mechanism by which S-allylmercaptocysteine induces histone acetylation remains to be characterized. It may be related in part to metabolism to allyl mercaptan, which is a more effective inhibitor of histone deacetylase.","['Lea, Michael A', 'Rasheed, Mariam', 'Randolph, Verrell M', 'Khan, Faika', 'Shareef, Asif', 'desBordes, Charles']","['Lea MA', 'Rasheed M', 'Randolph VM', 'Khan F', 'Shareef A', 'desBordes C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. lea@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (S-allylmercaptocysteine)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Sulfinic Acids)', '3C39BY17Y6 (allicin)', '81R3X99M15 (S-allylcysteine)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Allyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Disulfides', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism', 'Sulfinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2002/12/07 04:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2002/12/07 04:00'],"['2002/12/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/S15327914NC431_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2002;43(1):90-102. doi: 10.1207/S15327914NC431_11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cranial irradiation has been a routine part of past protocol treatment but is currently reserved only for select subsets of patients. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis may cause brain abnormalities such as intracerebral calcifications, cerebral atrophy, and white matter alterations. In addition, long-term neuropsychologic sequelae following CNS prophylaxis have been investigated marginally in children cured for ALL. METHODS: To explore possible correlations between neuroimaging findings and neuropsychologic outcome, we used detailed cognitive tests to evaluate 21 children with ALL who received cranial irradiation (range, 18-24 Gy) plus intrathecal MTX as CNS prophylaxis. All children were followed prospectively once a year by cerebral computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had continuous complete disease remission for at least 4 years and cognitive tests were performed after neuroradiologic examinations. RESULTS: White matter abnormalities were associated with poor performance only in a task exploring visual motor integration in about 50% of patients. Intracerebral calcifications correlate with the number of intrathecal MTX doses and with low scores in total intellectual quotient, performance intellectual quotient, and significant impairment in attention and visual motor integration tests. Girls are more vulnerable to the effects of CNS prophylaxis, whereas age at treatment and radiotherapy dose are not relevant to neuropsychologic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the need for careful follow-up of children's cognitive abilities because global intellectual measures often fail to detect specific disorders that may cause learning difficulties. Moreover, as the clinical implications of neuroimaging findings are often limited, periodic extensive evaluation by specific neurocognitive tests of mental abilities is recommended to detect early signs of cognitive impairment.","['Iuvone, Laura', 'Mariotti, Paolo', 'Colosimo, Cesare', 'Guzzetta, Francesco', 'Ruggiero, Antonio', 'Riccardi, Riccardo']","['Iuvone L', 'Mariotti P', 'Colosimo C', 'Guzzetta F', 'Ruggiero A', 'Riccardi R']","['Department of Pediatric Neuropsychiatry, Catholic University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Atrophy', 'Brain/drug effects/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2002/12/06 04:00,2003/01/07 04:00,['2002/12/06 04:00'],"['2002/12/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10999 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Dec 15;95(12):2562-70. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10999.,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.10997'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the demonstrated limitations of these vectors support the need for continued development of improved vectors. The intrinsic properties associated with the MLV genome and its life cycle do not favor the successful application of this vector system in certain human gene transfer applications. Since MLV integrates randomly into the host genome, transgene expression is frequently affected by the flanking host chromatin. MLV insertions can often result in silencing or position effect variation of gene expression either immediately after insertion or following cell expansion in culture or in vivo. Migration of the MLV pre-integration complex from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of infected cells requires mitosis for nuclear membrane breakdown. Since a majority of human cells exist in a quiescent state in vivo, it is unlikely that direct in vivo gene delivery into target tissues can be achieved with the MLV vector system. Finally, insertion of tissue-specific cis-regulatory sequences to direct transgene expression frequently results in either the rearrangement of the vector sequence or disruption of the cis-regulatory sequence functions. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of MLV, which contains a ubiquitously active enhancer/promoter element, may partially account for this problem. Together, these problems pose a major obstacle for the use of MLV vectors in the treatment of human diseases. This Chapter discusses some of the potential targets to which HIV vectors might be applied in clinical settings and some of the issues surrounding use of HIV vectors in gene transfer clinical trials.","['Yee, J K', 'Zaia, J A']","['Yee JK', 'Zaia JA']","['Department of Virology, Beckman Research Institute City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['5P01 A146030/PHS HHS/United States', 'M01 RR-43/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 30206-20/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods/standards', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Safety']",,2002/12/06 04:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/12/06 04:00'],"['2002/12/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1021034931852 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 2001 Nov;26(1-6):159-74. doi: 10.1023/a:1021034931852.,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncoretroviral vectors based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), on the other hand, can only transduce dividing cells. The reasons for increased ability of lentivirus vectors to transduce such cells has been attributed to several of the viral proteins (integrase, matrix and Vpr) that are purported to be involved in the nuclear import of the pre-integration complex (PIC). Nuclear import is also augmented by a unique triple stranded DNA region created during reverse transcription of the incoming viral RNA in the target cell (discussed in chapter 3). This chapter deals with the rationale behind the design of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) based packaging systems with an emphasis on some recent advances in the field for the creation of safe and efficient HIV-1 based vectors. The review covers trans-acting proteins and cis-sequences required for the deployment of HIV-1 vectors for gene transfer. This is a rapidly advancing field that with further refinements may soon allow the utilization of HIV-1 based and/or other lentivirus vectors in a clinical setting.","['Srinivasakumar, N']",['Srinivasakumar N'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37235, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, vpr', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",,2002/12/06 04:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/12/06 04:00'],"['2002/12/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1021074613196 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 2001 Nov;26(1-6):51-81. doi: 10.1023/a:1021074613196.,,,208,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, we used neutrophils from mice lacking the PI3-Kgamma isoform (PI3-Kgamma-/-) to determine the role that PI3-Kgamma occupies in neutrophil apoptosis under in vivo conditions. We found that neutrophil apoptosis under basal and LPS-stimulated conditions was increased in PI3-Kgamma-/- mice compared to that present in control PI3-Kgamma+/+ animals. Neutrophils from PI3-Kgamma-/- mice demonstrated decreased amounts of active, serine 473 phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated CREB, and diminished nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Levels of the CREB-dependent anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and of the NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic mediator Bcl-x(L) were significantly decreased in PI3-Kgamma-/- neutrophils. In contrast, PI3-Kgamma-/- neutrophils contained diminished amounts of phosphorylated, inactive forms of the pro-apoptotic mediators, Bad, FKHR, and GSK-3beta.

Twenty-five parents of children with ALL and thirty-four clinicians were interviewed to identify functional requirements and to demonstrate the system's potential to improve the experience and outcomes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Parental interviews focused on: medication and side effect management in the home; communication with the health care team; and the use of a computer for ALL home management. Results from these interviews provide strong evidence that parents of children with ALL are struggling to manage the complexity of their children's care in the home. Parents revealed an urgent need for tools that would help them to safely organize the medicines that their children receive while on ALL protocols. Forty percent of parents needed to know more about what to expect during their child's therapy and how to be prepared for it. Clinician interviews focused on the clinical impact and workflow issues associated with such a system. Decision support, prescription refill management, and educational and emotional support functions were considered key components. Clinicians were concerned that such a system would increase their already overburdened workload. Conversely, parents believed that access to such a system would eliminate unnecessary phone calls to the care team. Our findings show that parents would embrace collaborative Internet-based tools that would help with the home management of their child's leukemia.","['Goldsmith, D M', 'Silverman, L B', 'Safran, C']","['Goldsmith DM', 'Silverman LB', 'Safran C']","['Clinician Support Technology, Framingham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['1 R43 CA88737-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc AMIA Symp,Proceedings.

We studied 8 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), including 5 patients in the chronic phase (CP), 3 patients in the accelerated phase (AP), and 2 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in their first complete remission. Cells from these patients were used as stimulators in a mixed lymphocyte reaction.The effects of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) were separated by observing tests for cytotoxicity to target cells, including K562 cells, the patient's leukemic cells, and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts. Donor-derived antileukemic CTLs againstthe patient's own leukemic cells are productive in vitro. The efficacy of generating CTLs against leukemic target cells was (in decreasing order) AML, CML-CP, and CML-AP. Cytotoxic activity against leukemic targets was prominent in 4 cases--2 CML-CP and the 2 AML cases. On the contrary, the 3 cases of CML-AP showed low CTL activity. In cases showing 1 positive result among 3 targets (K562 cells, the patient's leukemic cells, and PHA blasts), the relapse rate was significantly lower (P = .022) on follow-up (median, 33 months; 7-40 months) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. By a combined analysis of the cytotoxicity effects for all 3 target cells, we were able to demonstrate a correlation between leukemic relapse and the variable degree of the cytotoxicity test results. Although the total sample numbers for this study were low, we speculate that these results may come from differences in the individual characteristics of the leukemic cells that are in line with their clinical disease status.","['Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Tai-Gyu', 'Cho, Hyun Il', 'Han, Hoon', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Chun-Choo']","['Kim HJ', 'Kim TG', 'Cho HI', 'Han H', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982699 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Nov;76(4):370-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02982699.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to determine if thalidomide improved the quality of life by virtue of its associated sleep-promoting, anxiety-reducing, antiwasting, and antidiarrheal effects. We therefore studied 28 patients with resistant chronic graft-versus-host disease who were treated with thalidomide (13 patients) or other immunosuppressive drugs (15) and compared them with healthy control subjects (16). All patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires prospectively before beginning regimens of thalidomide or other immunosuppressive drugs and completed similar questionnaires at 3- and 6-month intervals thereafter. The Transplant Symptom Frequency score was similar for healthy control subjects and both groups of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease, regardless of whether they had received thalidomide or not. Quality of sleep was equally poor in patients who received or did not receive thalidomide. The most common complaint of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease was fatigue, followed in frequency by overeating. The control group had similar concerns. This pilot study suggests that patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease have a quality of life similar to that of their health care workers, regardless of whether they are treated with thalidomide or other immunosuppressive drug, and that fatigue and overeating are the most common complaints.","['Miller, Steve', 'Sharda, Shalini', 'Rodrigue, James', 'Mehta, Paulette']","['Miller S', 'Sharda S', 'Rodrigue J', 'Mehta P']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Thalidomide/*administration & dosage']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982698 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Nov;76(4):365-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02982698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the cellular repair response, we investigated the kinetics of DNA excision repair initiated by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) in human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at an exponential growth phase in vitro. Using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay, we quantitated the repair kinetics as the amount of DNA single-strand breaks that were generated from the incision and were diminished by the rejoining in the repair process. CEM cells could initiate DNA excision repair in response to BCNU by starting an incision reaction. However, the incision capacity came to a plateau at a concentration of 80 to 100 microM or after an incubation time of 90 to 120 minutes. When the cells were pulsed with 40 microM BCNU, the maximal incision occurred at the end of the incubation period, and the repair process was completed within 4 hours When cells were treated with 100 microM BCNU, the incised DNA was not rejoined at 4 hours, suggesting that the repair was not completed. Higher concentrations might surpass the cellular capacity for repair and would be associated with increased cell death.

However, their use is limited by the risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Different strategies have been investigated to obtain all the benefits derived from donor lymphocytes while avoiding the risk of GVHD. Infusions of donor lymphocytes transduced with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene resulted in anti-tumor activity in a substantial number of patients. Acute GVHD could be effectively controlled by ganciclovir-induced elimination of the transduced cells. Haplo-identical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) is a promising therapeutic option for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies lacking an HLA-matched donor. However, the intensive T-cell depletion required to overcome the risk of lethal GVHD has been associated with a delayed immune recovery with a prolonged risk of posttransplantation viral, fungal, and other opportunistic infections. Donor lymphocyte infusions of HSV-tk represent a promising tool for preventing disease relapse and promoting immune reconstitution after haplo-SCT, and a unique tool for the control of GVHD.

Photochemical treatment (PCT) of T-cells with S-59 psoralen and long-wavelength UV-A light can inhibit their proliferative capacity and significantly decrease their ability to induce acute GVHD after allogeneic BMT. PCT donor T-cells have been shown to facilitate donor engraftment in a myeloablative BMT model. In this study, we examined whether donor T-cells subjected to PCT ex vivo could retain the ability to facilitate engraftment or increase donor chimerism after nonmyeloablative BMT or after establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism. In a transplantation model in which mice were conditioned for BMT with sublethal (600 cGy) TBI, an infusion of PCT donor T-cells was unable to facilitate engraftment of donor BM. A BMT model was used in which a mixture of allogeneic and syngeneic marrow cells was infused into lethally irradiated recipients for establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism. The goal was to determine whether PCT donor splenocytes could increase levels of donor chimerism. Recipients of splenocytes treated with UV-A light only (no S-59 psoralen) and given at the time of BMT or in a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) had significantly higher levels of donor chimerism than did recipients of BM only. Although PCT donor splenocytes given at the time of BMT modestly increased donor chimerism, PCT donor splenocytes given in a DLI did not increase donor chimerism. A nonmyeloablative BMT model was employed for determining whether DLI given relatively late after BMT could increase donor chimerism. Recipient mice were conditioned for BMT with a combination of low-dose TBI (50 or 100 cGy) and anti-CD154 (anti-CD40L) monoclonal antibody for achievement of low levels of mixed chimerism. When control mixed chimeras were given a DLI 71 days after BMT, donor chimerism was significantly increased. In contrast, PCT of the donor cells eliminated the ability of the cells to increase donor chimerism after infusion. Together results from these 3 distinct BMT models indicate that PCT of donor T-cells significantly inhibited the ability of the cells to facilitate donor engraftment after nonmyeloablative BMT or to increase donor chimerism in mixed hematopoietic chimeras when the cells were administered in a DLI.","['Johnson, Bryon D', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Stankowski, Marja C', 'Talib, Sohel', 'Hearst, John E', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Johnson BD', 'Taylor PA', 'Stankowski MC', 'Talib S', 'Hearst JE', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA. bjohnson@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 AI34449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL63452/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL56067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['KTZ7ZCN2EX (Ficusin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Ficusin/pharmacology', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PUVA Therapy', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.abbmt080581 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(11):581-7. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.abbmt080581.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission, both in bone marrow and skin, was obtained after induction course. Then the patient received consolidation course and megatherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. Skin relapse occurred early. The complete remission no. 2 was not obtained by second line treatment: new LC appeared when PMN count increased more than 10(9)/l. Then, the child was treated with oral VP16 but disease progressed with more and more LC, followed by bone marrow relapse. Child's death occurred about one year after diagnosis.","['Dalle, J H', 'Mortier, L', 'Roumier, C', 'Lai, J L', 'Catteau, B', 'Delaporte, E', 'Nelken, B']","['Dalle JH', 'Mortier L', 'Roumier C', 'Lai JL', 'Catteau B', 'Delaporte E', 'Nelken B']","['Clinique de pediatrie, unite protegee A, Hopital Jeanne-de-Flandre, CHRU de Lille, 59037 Lille, France. jhdalle@wanadoo.fr']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-693X(02)00052-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0929-693x(02)00052-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2002 Oct;9(10):1046-9. doi: 10.1016/s0929-693x(02)00052-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,Manifestations cutanees revelatrices d'une leucemie monoblastique.,,,,

They were able to transfer a fraction of the sensitizer to neighboring control cells. The transfer took place through direct membrane contact. Light exposures, inactivating about 20% of the sensitized cells, did not result in any acceleration of the transfer of PpIX. This is in contrast to what has been reported for PpIX in erythrocytes from patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria. In these cells light exposure transfers PpIX from the binding sites on hemoglobin to the plasma membrane and further to neighboring cells. The lack of light-induced transfer in the WiDr and Jurkat cells may be related to the binding sites of PpIX, supposedly membrane lipids and proteins embedded therein. Light exposure slightly increased the rate of loss of PpIX from WiDr cells.","['Moan, Johan', 'Ma, Li Wei', 'Stokke, Trond']","['Moan J', 'Ma LW', 'Stokke T']","['Department of Biophysics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. johan.moan@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', '*Light', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(2002)076<0526:topibc>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2002 Nov;76(5):526-9. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2002)076<0526:topibc>2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The subjects (n = 144,627) in the base cohort had lived outside the municipal tapwater system during 1967-1980. A subcohort was formed as a stratified random sample of the base cohort and subjects using drinking water from drilled wells prior to 1981 were identified. A case-cohort design was used comparing exposure among cases with leukemia (n = 35) with a stratified random sample (n = 274) from the subcohort. Activity concentrations of uranium, radium-226, and radon in the drinking water were analyzed using radiochemical and alpha-spectrometric methods. RESULTS: The median activity concentration of uranium in well water was 0.08 Bq/L for the leukemia cases and 0.06 Bq/L for the reference group, radon concentrations 80 and 130 Bq/L, respectively, and radium-226 concentrations 0.01 Bq/L for both groups. The hazard ratio of leukemia for uranium was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.73-1.13) per Bq/L. for radon 0.79 per Bq/L (95% CI 0.27-2.29), and for radium-226 0.80 (95% CI 0.46-1.39) per Bq/L.

METHODS: 535 Asian and 6629 white residents diagnosed with leukemia were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program during 1973 through 1986 in Hawaii, San Francisco/Oakland, and western Washington. A special tabulation of the 1980 US census was used to estimate the size and composition of the population at risk in these three areas. RESULTS: The incidence of leukemia, either considered as a whole or as individual types, did not appreciably vary between US-born and foreign-born Asian Americans. For all forms of leukemia combined the rates per 100,000 person-years among males were 6.5 for foreign-born Chinese, 7.4 for foreign-born Japanese, and 7.5 for foreign-born Filipino as compared to 7.5 for US-born Chinese, 7.1 for US-born Japanese, and 5.4 for US-born Filipino. The rates in foreign-born Asian females and US-born Asian females were also similar. Asian Americans had a lower incidence of leukemia than US whites (rate of 13.3/100,000 person-years), particularly for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of birthplace, Asian Americans possess one or more characteristics which make their risk for leukemia less than that of US whites.","['Pan, Jenny W Y', 'Cook, Linda S', 'Schwartz, Stephen M', 'Weis, Noel S']","['Pan JW', 'Cook LS', 'Schwartz SM', 'Weis NS']","['University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Department of Epidemiology, Seattle 98195, USA. jwpang@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asian Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Surveillance', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1020608328969 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2002 Nov;13(9):791-5. doi: 10.1023/a:1020608328969.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds can be produced independently of specific humoral or cellular immune responses. A model of compartmental inhibition of HIV-1 infection is the placenta, an organ that prevents transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus in the majority of HIV-1 pregnancies. Studies of this organ elucidated new compounds and mechanisms for prevention and treatment of HIV including the potent inhibitor of HIV-1, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Besides coordinating the humoral and cellular immune responses, cytokines such as IFN-gamma exhibit intrinsic antiviral activity that represents the first line of defense against pathogens prior to the development of a specific immune response. The study of antiviral factors is particularly important in HIV/AIDS because of the direct destruction of the immune system by HIV-1. In this report, we focus on the identification and mechanism of endogenously produced anti-HIV factors and the overall function of these factors in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.","['Patterson, Bruce K', 'Tjernlund, Annelie', 'Andersson, Jan']","['Patterson BK', 'Tjernlund A', 'Andersson J']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Medical School, 2300 Children's Plaza, Chicago, IL 60614, USA. bpatterson@childrensmemorial.org""]",['eng'],"['2490/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI 41536-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 47065-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/12/05 04:00,2003/05/29 05:00,['2002/12/05 04:00'],"['2002/12/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1566524023361817 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2002 Dec;2(8):713-22. doi: 10.2174/1566524023361817.,,,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in countries with high prevalence cause major problems in the management of cancer patients. In this study, we evaluated the incidence and chronicity of HBV and HCV infections in children with malignant diseases receiving chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: One hundred ninety-eight children with cancer (mean age = 7.5 +/- 2.5 years) and 100 healthy children as a control group were screened for HBV and HCV. Liver function tests, the number of transfusions, HBV and HCV serology were regularly monitored. In seropositive children, HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA were measured. Chronic hepatitis was defined as having an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level three times of upper normal limit, positive HBV and HCV antigenemia for longer than 6 months. Liver biopsies were performed in all children with chronic hepatitis. The relationship between the chronic hepatitis and study parameters was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: HBsAg positivity, anti-HCV, and mixed (HBV and HCV) infection were found in 11.6, 5.5, 2% of children, respectively. Most HBV infected children developed chronic hepatitis (48%) while 26 and 21.7% became carriers and immune, respectively. One died of acute fulminant HBV hepatitis. Of HCV infected children, 63.6% also had positive HCV-RNA. Four children with mixed infection (100%) all progressed to chronic hepatitis. In this setting, chronic hepatitis was observed in 22 of 38 infected children (57.8%). The majority had leukemia and lymphoma. Children with HBsAg antigenemia developed chronic hepatitis in shorter time than HCV positive children (median 13 months vs. 51 months, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We observed an increased incidence of chronic hepatitis and even mortality due to HBV infection. This suggests that HBV and HCV infections are serious causes of morbidity and mortality in children with cancer.","['Sevinir, Betul', 'Meral, Adalet', 'Gunay, Unsal', 'Ozkan, Tanju', 'Ozuysal, Sema', 'Sinirtas, Melda']","['Sevinir B', 'Meral A', 'Gunay U', 'Ozkan T', 'Ozuysal S', 'Sinirtas M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Uludag University, Faculty of Medicine, Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey. adaletm@uludag.edu.tr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ABVD protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Dacarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Risk Factors', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use']",,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10090 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Feb;40(2):104-10. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10090.,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perfusion MRI is a novel method to study brain perfusion which has not been used previously in this setting. This study was performed to compare SPECT with perfusion MRI in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after treatment. PROCEDURE: Nineteen children or young adults underwent perfusion MRI at the cessation of treatment (n = 9) or 4-8 years after the treatment (n = 10). Seventeen of them also underwent SPECT at the time of MRI (within 0-3 days, n = 14) or a couple of months later (1.5-6 months, n = 3). SPECT images and relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps from perfusion MRI were analyzed visually. Relative CBV ratios of gray matter to white matter and thalamus to white matter were also calculated from the perfusion MRI. RESULTS: Perfusion MRI did not show any focal perfusion defects, while small defects were observed by SPECT in five of 17 children (29%) in the basal, frontal or temporal areas on the left. No significant differences were observed by perfusion MRI in the relative CBV ratios in the different treatment groups. Time since treatment, age at diagnosis, brain irradiation, or findings in conventional MRI or SPECT did not have any effect on the relative perfusion values either. CONCLUSIONS: SPECT may show small perfusion defects after treatment for childhood leukemia which are not visible by perfusion MRI.

The common theme in all NUP98 chimeras is a transcript consisting of the 5' part of NUP98 and the 3' portion of the partner gene; however, apart from the frequent fusion to different homeobox genes, there is no apparent similarity among the other partners. We here report a de novo acute myeloid leukemia with a t(11;12)(p15;q13), resulting in a novel NUP98/HOXC13 fusion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, by the use of probes covering NUP98 and the HOXC gene cluster at 12q13, revealed a fusion signal at the der(11)t(11;12), indicating a NUP98/HOXC chimera, whereas no fusion was found on the der(12)t(11;12), suggesting that the translocation was accompanied by a deletion of the reciprocal fusion gene. Reverse transcription-PCR and sequence analyses showed that exon 16 (nucleotide 2290) of NUP98 was fused in-frame with exon 2 (nucleotide 852) of HOXC13. Neither the HOXC13/NUP98 transcript nor the normal HOXC13 was expressed. The present results, together with previous studies of NUP98/homeobox gene fusions, strongly indicate that NUP98/HOXC13 is of pathogenetic importance in t(11;12)-positive acute myeloid leukemia.","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Isaksson, Margareth', 'Billstrom, Rolf', 'Strombeck, Bodil', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Isaksson M', 'Billstrom R', 'Strombeck B', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. ioannis.panagopoulos@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (HOXC13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXC13 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10139 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jan;36(1):107-12. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10139.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",26,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genomic rearrangements of MOZ and CBP have been detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analyses, characterization of the breakpoints at the sequence level has never been performed. We have sequenced the breakpoints in four t(8;16)-positive AML cases with the aim to identify molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the origin of this translocation. In addition, an exon/intron map of the MOZ gene was constructed, which was found to be composed of 17 exons. Long-range-PCR with CBP forward primers in exon 2 and MOZ reverse primers in exon 17 as well as with a MOZ forward primer in exon 16 and a CBP reverse primer in intron 2 successfully amplified CBP/MOZ and MOZ/CBP hybrid genomic DNA fragments in all four AMLs. The breaks clustered in both CBP intron 2 and MOZ intron 16, and were close to repetitive elements, and in one case an Alu-Alu junction for the CBP/MOZ hybrid was identified. Additional genomic events (i.e., deletions, duplications, and insertions) in the breakpoint regions in both the MOZ and CBP genes were found in all four cases. Thus, the t(8;16) does not originate through a simple end-to-end fusion. The findings of multiple breaks and rearrangements rather suggest the involvement of a damage-repair mechanism in the origin of this translocation.","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Isaksson, Margareth', 'Lindvall, Charlotta', 'Hagemeijer, Anna', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Isaksson M', 'Lindvall C', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. ioannis.panagopoulos@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CBP-MOZ fusion protein, human)', '0 (MOZ-CBP fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10137 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jan;36(1):90-8. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10137.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ315151', 'GENBANK/AJ315152', 'GENBANK/AJ315153', 'GENBANK/AJ315154', 'GENBANK/AJ315155', 'GENBANK/AJ315156', 'GENBANK/AJ315157', 'GENBANK/AJ315158']",,,,,

We recently encountered an infant patient with rapidly progressive AML whose leukemic cells harbored a previously undescribed MLL rearrangement involving an inversion of 11q [inv(11)(q14q23)]. We used panhandle PCR to determine that this rearrangement juxtaposed the MLL (Mixed-Lineage Leukemia) gene to the CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia) gene at 11q14-q21. The CALM protein participates in recruitment of clathrin to internal membrane surfaces, thereby regulating vesicle formation in both endocytosis and intracellular protein transport. Intriguingly, CALM has been identified in other cases of AML as a translocation partner for the AF10 gene, which has independently been found to be an MLL partner in AML. We identified the MLL-CALM fusion transcript (but not the reciprocal CALM-MLL transcript) in leukemia cell RNA by RT-PCR. The predicted 1803 amino acid MLL-CALM fusion protein includes amino-terminal MLL domains involved in transcriptional repression, and carboxy-terminal CALM-derived clathrin-binding domains. The genomic breakpoint in MLL is in the 7th intron (within the breakpoint cluster region); the corresponding CALM breakpoint is in the 7th CALM intron. In contrast, breakpoints in CALM-AF10 translocations lie in the 17th-19th CALM introns (30 kb downstream); also, in these translocations, CALM provides the 5' end of the fusion transcript. Together with its previously recognized association with AF10 in AML, the identification of CALM as an MLL fusion partner suggests that interference with clathrin-mediated trafficking pathways may be an underappreciated mechanism in leukemogenesis.","['Wechsler, Daniel S', 'Engstrom, Lars D', 'Alexander, Brian M', 'Motto, David G', 'Roulston, Diane']","['Wechsler DS', 'Engstrom LD', 'Alexander BM', 'Motto DG', 'Roulston D']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA. dwechsl@umich.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Transcription Factors']",,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10136 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jan;36(1):26-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10136.,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF477006'],,,,,

METHODS: Cyclin D1 expression was evaluated in 11 healthy controls and 51 patients with B-LPD by flow cytometry using the 5D4 monoclonal antibody. In 25 cases, experiments were repeated up to four times with mononuclear cells (MNC) fixed in ethanol for 1-120 days to evaluate the consistency of cyclin D1 expression. Flow cytometry results were compared with fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for the t(11;14) translocation in 19 patients and with immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the DCS-6 monoclonal antibody in nine patients. RESULTS: A mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFIR) of 4.8 was defined as the cut off point for positivity based on cyclin D1 expression in healthy controls (mean + 3 SD). Ten patients overexpressed cyclin D1 by flow cytometry. These included five of eight patients with mantle cell lymphoma, four of 19 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and one with follicular lymphoma. MFIR in the repeat experiments differed less than 25% in 20 of 25 patients and in no cases did it cross the cut off point. There was a good correlation between cyclin D1 expression by flow cytometry and FISH for t(11;14) in 15 of 19 patients and six of nine had concordant results with flow cytometry, FISH, and IHC. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 expression remains fairly stable once MNC are fixed in ethanol and the flow cytometric assay can be used for the routine screening of B-LPD. Further comparisons between flow cytometry, IHC, and FISH may be needed to ascertain the diagnostic value of the flow cytometric assay.","['Jain, P', 'Giustolisi, G M', 'Atkinson, S', 'Elnenaei, M O', 'Morilla, R', 'Owusu-Ankomah, K', 'Rafiq-Mohammed, F', 'Matutes, E', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Catovsky, D']","['Jain P', 'Giustolisi GM', 'Atkinson S', 'Elnenaei MO', 'Morilla R', 'Owusu-Ankomah K', 'Rafiq-Mohammed F', 'Matutes E', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Catovsky D']","['Department of Academic Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['*B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC1769833,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.55.12.940 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2002 Dec;55(12):940-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.55.12.940.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic differentiation block is attributed to deregulated transcription caused by these chimeric fusion proteins, which aberrantly recruit histone-deacetylase (HDAC) activity. One essential differentiation pathway blocked by the leukemic fusion proteins is the vitamin (Vit) D(3) signaling. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which the leukemic fusion proteins interfere with VitD(3)-induced differentiation. The VitD(3)-receptor (VDR) is, like the retinoid receptors RAR, retinoid X receptor, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of TR and RAR is silenced by recruitment of HDAC activity through binding to corepressors. In the presence of ligand, TR and RAR activate transcription by releasing HDAC activity and by recruiting histone-acetyltransferase activity. Here we report that VDR binds corepressors in a ligand-dependent manner and that inhibition of HDAC activity increases VitD(3) sensitivity of HL-60 cells. Nevertheless, the inhibition of HDAC activity is unable to overcome the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation caused by PLZF/RARalpha expression. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the translocation products PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha impairs the localization of VDR in the nucleus by binding to VDR. Furthermore, the overexpression of VDR in U937 cells expressing AML-related translocation products completely abolishes the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation.

Frequent abnormalities of the tumor suppressor genes Rb, p53, p15INK4B, p16INK4A and p14ARF have been reported. However, no oncogenes associated with tumorigenesis of NK cell neoplasms have been reported so far. We analyzed the status of oncogenes including N-ras, K-ras, H-ras, c-myc, N-myc and mdm2 by Southern blot, PCR-SSCP, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. We analyzed four cell lines derived from NK cell neoplasms and 31 clinical samples with five subclasses of NK cell neoplasms. We found no point mutations of the ras family genes. We detected no mutations in the c-myc and N-myc genes. No overexpression of c-Myc protein was detected by western blot analysis. Although we found neither amplification nor rearrangement of the mdm2 gene, we found high expression of MDM2 protein in some cases by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the overexpression of MDM2 protein. We found 14 cases with overexpression of MDM2 protein out of 15 cases (93%) with four subclasses of NK cell neoplasms except chronic NK lymphocytosis. Our previous and these results suggested that the expression level of MDM2 protein is independent of the status of the p14ARF, p53, Rb genes. MDM2 protein might independently contribute to carcinogenesis of NK cell neoplasms. Although the number of the cases we analyzed was not large, alterations of ras and myc family genes may rarely contribute to tumorigenesis in NK cell neoplasms. In contrast, overexpression of MDM2 might be associated with tumorigenesis of NK cell neoplasms, especially aggressive subclasses.","['Sugimoto, Kei-ji', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Sakajiri, Sakura', 'Oshimi, Kazuo']","['Sugimoto KJ', 'Kawamata N', 'Sakajiri S', 'Oshimi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Genes, myc', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5926889,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/08/22 05:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01234.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Nov;93(11):1270-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01234.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the mechanism of action of IGF-1R in T-cell expansion, we investigated the signalling pathways activated by IGF-1 in T cells and in Jurkat cells. We found that IGF-1 transiently induces Akt, jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and c-Jun phosphorylation in activated T cells, with JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation occurring faster than Akt phosphorylation. To mimic IGF-1R expression levels in CD28-stimulated Jurkat cells these cells were stably transfected to over-express the IGF-1R. Jurkat/IGF-1R cells exhibited enhanced constitutive Akt phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected controls, but IGF-1 induced transient phosphorylation of MKK4, JNKs, and c-Jun. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation with LY294002 totally suppressed IGF-1-mediated protection from Fas killing in activated T cells, but only partially suppressed IGF-1-mediated protection in Jurkat/IGF-1R cells. However, either dicumarol in T cells or a dominant negative JNK1 (APF) in Jurkat/IGF-1R cells greatly suppressed IGF-1-mediated protection from Fas killing. Together, these data demonstrate that IGF-1-mediated activation of JNKs and PI-3 kinase contributes to normal T-cell survival, whereas the JNK pathway may be more important in Jurkat leukaemia cells.","['Walsh, Patrick T', 'Smith, Loraine M', ""O'Connor, Rosemary""]","['Walsh PT', 'Smith LM', ""O'Connor R""]","['Department of Biochemistry and Biosciences Research Institute, National University of Ireland, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*immunology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*immunology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",PMC1782831,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['1525 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2002.01525.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2002 Dec;107(4):461-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2002.01525.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, Hex over-expression significantly increased myeloid progenitor cycling, which may explain its role in retrovirally induced murine leukaemia.","['Mack, David L', 'Leibowitz, David S', 'Cooper, Scott', 'Ramsey, Heather', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Mack DL', 'Leibowitz DS', 'Cooper S', 'Ramsey H', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Hromas R']","['Department of Medicine, the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL48914/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 66308/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066308/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Hhex protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line/immunology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics/immunology', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphopenia/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC1782816,2002/12/04 04:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/12/04 04:00'],"['2002/12/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['1523 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2002.01523.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2002 Dec;107(4):444-51. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2002.01523.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IL-15 was previously found to be a human neutrophil agonist, its mode of action remains unknown. Herein, we were interested in elucidating the mechanisms by which it delays neutrophil apoptosis. IL-15 was found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation events and to prevent loss of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein expression. Using different signal transduction inhibitors, we found that Janus kinase (Jak)-2, Jak-3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not G proteins, are involved in IL-15-induced suppression of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that IL-15 activates Jak-2, p38 MAPK and ERK-1/2, but, unlike granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), it does not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5a/b. We conclude that IL-15 delays neutrophil apoptosis via several pathways, and that Mcl-1 and several kinases contribute to this.

Previous retrospective studies have shown high response rates after local palliative RT of 4 Gy in 2 fractions, which prompted this prospective Phase II trial of the palliative effect of this regimen in patients with disseminated INHL or CLL. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-two patients (11 men, 11 women, median age 62 years, range 30-89) with disseminated INHL (n = 15) or CLL (n = 7) were treated with local low-dose RT, 2 Gy x 2 within 3 days, with the aim of achieving palliation from localized lymphoma masses. The patients were treated to a total of 31 different sites. Seventeen patients had previously been treated with chemotherapy. The median observation time after the start of RT was 8 months (range 3-26). RESULTS: All patients and all irradiated sites were assessable for response. Of the 22 patients, 18 responded to the treatment, corresponding to an overall response rate (RR) of 82%; 12 patients (55%) achieved a complete response (CR), 5 patients (22%) a partial response (PR), and 1 patient had a CR at three sites and a PR at one site. Of the 31 irradiated sites, 27 responded to treatment, corresponding to an overall RR of 87%; in 20 sites (65%) a CR was achieved and in 7 sites (22%) a PR. Patients with disseminated INHL had an overall RR of 87% (74% CR, 13% PR); patients with CLL had an overall RR of 71% (29% CR, 42% PR). The median duration of response was estimated at 22 months. None of the patients had significant side effects from the treatment. CONCLUSION: Low-dose RT (4 Gy in 2 fractions) is a highly effective palliative treatment of localized lymphoma masses in patients with disseminated INHL and CLL. The treatment has minimal side effects.","['Johannsson, Jakob', 'Specht, Lena', 'Mejer, Johannes', 'Jensen, Bjarne Anker']","['Johannsson J', 'Specht L', 'Mejer J', 'Jensen BA']","['Department of Oncology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Time Factors']",,2002/12/03 04:00,2003/01/03 04:00,['2002/12/03 04:00'],"['2002/12/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/12/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['S036030160203050X [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(02)03050-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Dec 1;54(5):1466-70. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(02)03050-x.,,,,,"['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Jul 15;56(4):1206; author reply 1206.

Previous phase II studies showed that bendamustine induced high remission rates in pre-treated low-grade NHL. To further examine its efficacy and side effects, bendamustine has been studied in a large number of patients with pre-treated low-grade NHL. Follow-up time was 3-8 years. METHODS: From 1993 to 1998, 102 patients with pre-treated low-grade NHL [histologic subtypes: CLL n=15, immunocytic n=46, multiple myeloma (MM) n=25, others n=16] received a median of four (range 1-11) 5-day cycles of daily 60 mg/m(2) bendamustine as salvage chemotherapy. Bendamustine was given in short i.v. infusions mainly at intervals of 4-6 weeks. RESULTS: Partial and complete remissions were observed in 76.5% and disease stabilization in 19.6% of the patients. Only 3.9% showed progressive disease. Median duration of response was 39 months for the NHL patients and 17 months for the MM patients. Median survival time was 32 months for the CLL patients, 31.5 months for the NHL patients and 17.5 months for the MM patients. Non-haematological side effects consisted mainly in reversible reduction of performance status, loss of appetite, and nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea, which were of WHO grade III/IV in less than 5% of patients. Haematological toxicities of WHO grade III/IV have been observed in 6.9%, 11.8%, and 24.5% of patients for hemoglobin, thrombocytes, and leukocytes, respectively. Alopecia did not occur. Febrile episodes or bacterial as well as viral, particularly opportunistic, infections were not observed, although bendamustine induced profound and long-lasting lymphocytopenias, including CD4+-, CD8+-, CD19+-, B-lymphocytes, and NK-cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine proved to be very effective in pre-treated low-grade NHL patients by inducing high rates of long-lasting remissions. Bendamustine combines the pharmacological properties of an alkylating agent with those of a purine analogue and showed no cross-resistance to chlorambucil, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and other anthracyclines. The myelosuppressive toxicities were dose limiting, and the non-haematological side effects were moderate.","['Bremer, Karl']",['Bremer K'],"['Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Augusta-Kranken-Anstalt, Bergstrasse 26, 44791 Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,2002/11/30 04:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/11/30 04:00'],"['2002/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-002-0378-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2002 Nov;128(11):603-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-002-0378-6.

Comparing with the results of normal thymic cells we did not found any difference or abnormalities in the phenotype. A brief discussion of theories of histogenesis and possible differential diagnosis of ectopic thymus is included. The most common immune pattern of both, ectopic and normal thymuses, was expression of TdT,CD7,cCD3,CD1 and dual CD4/CD8. Early results of immunological examination confirmed by histopathology stated the diagnosis of ectopic thymus and excluded other causes (infection, trauma, neoplasm and congenital abnormalities). The study of both, ectopic and normal thymic tissue provides a perfect model for comparative analysis of some T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Both, thymocytes and some cases of our T-ALL (20 of 48 examined T-ALL) had a specific late cortical T-cell phenotype. We observed new qualities of both, thymic cells and T-ALL cells of a late cortical phenotype that resulted in cell populations localized in the so-called ""empty spaces"", in fluorescence histograms, that might be discriminated from internal T-cell populations with normal antigen expression. An important sign of T-ALL in common is to display aberrant marker combinations and the tendency to drop specific normal T-cell antigens. Aberrant markers were present in our study in a phenotypic group of a late cortical T-ALL in 11 cases (55.0%) of the 20 studied. As aberrant markers we observed mostly CD10, CD34, HLA-DR and CD13. Furthermore, the tendency to drop specific normal T-cell markers could be recognized in one case of a late cortical T-ALL in the form of TCRab and TCRgd absence. DNA analysis did not reveal any changes in proliferation index either in thymocytes (normal or ectopic), or in T-ALL of a late cortical T-cell phenotype. Based on our findings the clinical utility of comparing the results obtained from the immunophenotypic characterization of healthy hematopoietic and leukemia cells can be concluded. An exact and early diagnosis of hematopoietic disorders (ectopic thymus, T-ALL and T-NHL) and identification of identical phenotypic patterns at different times (for more exact minimal residual disease detection during and after therapy) could be obtained.","['Babusikova, O', 'Tomova, A']","['Babusikova O', 'Tomova A']","['Cancer Research Institute; Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, 83391 Slovakia. exonobab@savba.sk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'CD13 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/*immunology']",,2002/11/30 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/11/30 04:00'],"['2002/11/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2002;49(5):312-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expansion increases viral transmission to new hosts, but the mechanisms of this expansion have not been determined. We hypothesized that BLV infection contributes to B-cell expansion by signaling initiated via viral transmembrane protein motifs undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation. Viral mimicry of host cell proteins is a well-demonstrated mechanism by which viruses may increase propagation or decrease recognition by the host immune system. The cytoplasmic tail of BLV transmembrane protein gp30 (TM) has multiple areas of homology to motifs of host cell signaling proteins, including two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), which are homologous to B-cell receptor and inhibitory co-receptor motifs. Signaling by these motifs in B cells typically relies on tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by interactions with Src-homology-2 (SH2) domains of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases or phosphatases. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of TM was tested in four systems including ex vivo cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV infected cows, BLV-expressing fetal lamb kidney cell and bat lung cell lines, and DT40 B cells transfected with a fusion of mouse extracellular CD8alpha and cytoplasmic TM. No phosphorylation of TM was detected in our experiments in any of the cell types utilized, or with various stimulation methods.

At nanomolar and low micromolar concentrations, metvan induces apoptosis in human leukaemia cells, multiple myeloma cells and solid tumour cells derived from breast cancer, glioblastoma, ovarian, prostate and testicular cancer patients. It is highly effective against cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer and testicular cancer cell lines. Metvan is much more effective than the standard chemotherapeutic agents dexamethasone and vincristine in inducing apoptosis in primary leukaemia cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia or chronic acute myeloid leukaemia. Metvan-induced apoptosis is associated with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of glutathione. Treatment of leukaemia cells from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic acute myeloid leukaemia patients with metvan inhibits the constitutive expression as well as the gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2. Treatment of human malignant glioblastoma and breast cancer cells with metvan at concentrations > 1 microM is associated with a nearly complete loss of the adhesive, migratory and invasive properties of the treated cancer cell populations. Metvan shows favourable pharmacokinetics in mice and does not cause acute or subacute toxicity at the dose levels tested (12.5 - 50 mg/kg). Therapeutic plasma concentrations > or = 5 microM, which are highly cytotoxic against human cancer cells, can be rapidly achieved and maintained in mice for at least 24 h after intraperitoneal bolus injection of a single 10 mg/kg non-toxic dose of metvan. Metvan exhibits significant antitumour activity, delays tumour progression and prolongs survival time in severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models of human malignant glioblastoma and breast cancer. The broad spectrum anticancer activity of metvan together with favourable pharmacodynamic features and lack of toxicity warrants further development of this oxovanadium compound as a new anticancer agent. Metvan could represent the first vanadium complex as an alternative to platinum-based chemotherapy.","[""D'Cruz, Osmond J"", 'Uckun, Fatih M']","[""D'Cruz OJ"", 'Uckun FM']","['Drug Discovery Program, Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Parker Hughes Institute, 2699 Patton Road, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA. odcruz@ih.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (bis(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)sulfatooxovanadium(IV))', '20644-97-7 (oxovanadium IV)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2002/11/30 04:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2002/11/30 04:00'],"['2002/11/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/13543784.11.12.1829 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 Dec;11(12):1829-36. doi: 10.1517/13543784.11.12.1829.,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After immediate nerve repair LIF administration resulted in 2.5- to 3-fold improvements compared with saline. In the 1-day delayed group, both saline and LIF treatment groups were comparable with that achieved with immediate repair combined with LIF. This result is consistent with the concept of preconditioning. In the 1-week delayed repair groups with LIF, muscle mass recovery and maximum force contraction were improved by 32% and 55%, respectively, compared with saline, whereas repairs delayed for 4 weeks showed increases of 50% and 36%. All delayed repairs treated with LIF were more effective than immediate repair with saline, but not as effective as primary repair with LIF.

To characterize the mode of cell death induced by the inhibition of caspase-3, we have studied the effects of Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-YVAD-CHO, and Ac-IETD-CHO, inhibitors of caspases, on structural changes in X-irradiated human leukemic MOLT-4 cells. When cells were irradiated with X-rays and incubated in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO, the expression of cell death, as measured by the dye exclusion test, was inhibited, whereas no such change was observed in colony-forming ability. The hallmarks of apoptosis, i.e., nuclear condensation and DNA ladder formation, were depressed. However, a new type of nuclear morphology appeared. The sum of the frequencies of apoptosis and this new type of nuclear structure corresponded to the frequency of X-ray-induced apoptosis for cells incubated in the absence of Ac-DEVD-CHO. Removal of Ac-DEVD-CHO during the course of post-irradiation incubation increased apoptotic nuclear condensation accompanied by a slight decrease in the frequency of the new type of nuclear structure. When Ac-IETD-CHO was used in place of Ac-DEVD-CHO, inhibition of cell death (apoptosis) was also observed, but not in the case of Ac-YVAD-CHO. These results suggest that the inhibition of caspase-3 diminishes the expression of apoptotic hallmarks with no effect on cell survival, that the morphology observed in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO is an apoptosis-related structure, and that the cell death observed is a programmed cell death independent of caspase-3. The development of this mode of cell death was slower than that of apoptosis by 4 h.","['Nakano, Hisako', 'Shinohara, Kunio']","['Nakano H', 'Shinohara K']","['Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8613, Japan. nakano@rinshoken.or.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/radiation effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00441-002-0635-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2002 Dec;310(3):305-11. doi: 10.1007/s00441-002-0635-7.

We aim to determine the effective amount of energy supplied and its short-term effects in children requiring BMT. METHODS: Twenty children (11 males, 9 females, mean age 8 years, range 1-18 years) receiving 13 allogenic and 7 autologous BMT for malignant (13) and nonmalignant (7) diseases, were retrospectively evaluated for energy/protein intakes, weight changes, time to engraftment and on TPN, occurrence of complications, and metabolic abnormalities. RESULTS: Each child received approximately 72% of the prescribed calories, an average of 0.87 +/- 0.2 x basal-metabolic rate, 1.14 +/- 0.4 g protein/kg/day, and 176 +/- 34:1 nonprotein calories:nitrogen ratio. Body weight improved during the 35 days (range 14-62) of TPN, with loss thereafter. Engraftment occurred in 20 +/- 7.5 days. Caloric intake and time to engraftment were related (p = 0.002). Ten central-venous-line and 12 gastrointestinal infections occurred. Among laboratory abnormalities, liver function tests resulted temporarily altered in 10 patients, and permanently in 1 child with cholestasis. Eight children developed graft-versus-host disease. Five died of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The energy supplied with TPN in BMT is less than expected and approximately covers the BMR with mixed effects. Energy intake needs to be calibrated during TPN and adjusted during feeding resumption to expedite recovery.","['Forchielli, M L', 'Azzi, N', 'Cadranel, S', 'Paolucci, G']","['Forchielli ML', 'Azzi N', 'Cadranel S', 'Paolucci G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical School, Bologna, Italy. l.for@med.unibo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Weight', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Energy Intake', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', '*Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['66513 [pii]', '10.1159/000066513 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2003;64(1):7-13. doi: 10.1159/000066513.,,"['Copyright 2003 S.

This study was based on the hypothesis that IL-6 is the activating cytokine for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat), the transcription factor whose presence is required for controlled mammary gland involution. We now show that expression of IL-6 is low during lactation but increases at the onset of involution in parallel with the activation of Stat3 and p44/42 MAPK. Moreover, we demonstrated that injection of IL-6 into virgin and lactating mice activates Stat3 in mammary epithelium. The in vivo role of IL-6 was investigated using mutant mice. Involution of mammary tissue in IL-6-null mice was delayed similar to that seen in mammary conditional Stat3- and Bax-null mice. However, Stat3 activation during involution was independent of the IL-6 status. This suggests that either IL-6 does not induce Stat3 in vivo or its absence is compensated for by other cytokines, such as leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, the increase of p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) phosphorylation at the onset of involution was dependent on the presence of IL-6. Delayed involution corresponded with a decrease of epithelial cell death, and a delayed induction of Bax and sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP2, or clusterin) expression. Our experiments demonstrate on a genetic level that IL-6 contributes to the induction of the controlled remodeling of mammary tissue during involution, possibly through the MAPK pathway and by mediating the expression of the cell death protein Bax.","['Zhao, Ling', 'Melenhorst, J Joseph', 'Hennighausen, Lothar']","['Zhao L', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Hennighausen L']","['Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and Hematology Branch/NIH, Building 8 Room 101, 8 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

In this study, we show that synaptotagmin III (Syt III), a member of the Syt family of proteins, is required for the formation and delivery of cargo to the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). We demonstrate that rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells endogenously express Syt III, and >70% of this protein colocalizes with early endosomal markers, such as EEA1, annexin II and syntaxin 7, and the remaining protein colocalizes with secretory granule (SG) markers such as beta-hexosaminidase, histamine and serotonin. To study the functional role of Syt III, we stably transfected RBL cells with Syt III antisense cDNA and monitored the route of transferrin (Tfn) internalization in cells that displayed substantially reduced (<90%) levels of Syt III (RBL-Syt III(-)). In these cells, Tfn binding and internalization into early endosomes were unaltered. However, whereas in the mock-transfected cells Tfn was subsequently delivered to the ERC, in the RBL-Syt III(-) cells, Tfn remained associated with dispersed peripheral vesicles and Rab 11 remained cytosolic. Nevertheless, the rates of Tfn internalization and recycling were not affected. RBL-Syt III(-) cells also displayed enlarged SGs, reminiscent of the SGs present in Chediak-Higashi (beige) mice. However, morphometric analyses suggested that granule formation was unaltered and that the calculated unit granule volume is the same in both cell lines. Therefore, our results implicate Syt III as a critical factor for the generation and delivery of internalized cargo to the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment and suggest a possible link between ERC and recycling from immature SGs during the process of SG maturation.","['Grimberg, Elena', 'Peng, Ze', 'Hammel, Ilan', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Grimberg E', 'Peng Z', 'Hammel I', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Msln protein, rat)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Syt3 protein, rat)', '0 (Transferrin)', '134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rab11 protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', '*Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Compartmentation/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endocytosis/*genetics', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Mesothelin', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Secretory Vesicles/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Synaptotagmins', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Transport Vesicles/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/jcs.00186 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Jan 1;116(Pt 1):145-54. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncogenic v-Myb alterations include N- and C-terminal deletions as well as point mutations. Whereas truncations in Myb cause loss of various protein modifications, none of the point mutations in v-Myb has been directly linked to protein modifications. Here we show that the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb can be phosphorylated on serine 116 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of Ser(116) differentially destabilizes a subtype of c-Myb-DNA complexes. The V117D mutation of the AMV v-Myb oncoprotein abolishes phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser(116) residue. Modification of Ser(116) was also detected in live cells in c-Myb, but not in AMV v-Myb. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutants of c-Myb failed to activate the resident mim-1 gene. Our data imply that protein kinase A or a kinase with similar specificity negatively regulates c-Myb function, including collaboration with C/EBP, and that the leukemogenic AMV v-Myb version evades inactivation by a point mutation that abolishes a phosphoacceptor consensus site. This suggests a novel link between Myb, a signal transduction pathway, cooperativity with C/EBP, and a point mutation in the myb oncogene.","['Andersson, Kristin Brevik', 'Kowenz-Leutz, Elisabeth', 'Brendeford, Elen Margrethe', 'Tygsett, Ann-Helen Herwig', 'Leutz, Achim', 'Gabrielsen, Odd S']","['Andersson KB', 'Kowenz-Leutz E', 'Brendeford EM', 'Tygsett AH', 'Leutz A', 'Gabrielsen OS']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Quail', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/03/22 04:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M209404200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)30789-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Feb 7;278(6):3816-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M209404200.

Because the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt activation pathway is required for BCR-ABL-mediated transformation and survival signaling in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in this study we examined the involvement of FKHRL1 in the BCR-ABL-mediated signaling pathway. FKHRL1 was constitutively phosphorylated in BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines KCL22 and KU812, and its phosphorylation was inhibited by treatment with STI571, a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Concomitantly, STI571 induced cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase, accompanied by up-regulation of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1 in KCL22 cells. In addition, FKHRL1 was constitutively phosphorylated in the TF-1/bcr-abl cell line ectopically expressing BCR-ABL but not in the parent TF-1 cell line. Considering several lines of evidence that phosphorylated FKHRL1 has lost transcriptional activity and that p27/Kip1 expression is positively regulated by dephosphorylated ""active"" FKHRL1, BCR-ABL may down-regulate p27/Kip1 expression via the loss of FKHRL1 function as a transcription factor. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible ""active FKHRL1"" FKHRL1-TM (a triple mutant of FKHRL1, in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites have been mutated), estrogen receptor system in the KCL22 cell line. The addition of tamoxifen inhibited the cell growth indicating that overexpression of FKHRL1 in the nucleus antagonized deregulated proliferation of CML cells. Collectively, FKHRL1 regulates the expression of p27/Kip1 as a downstream molecule of BCR-ABL signaling in CML cells. BCR-ABL-induced loss of FKHRL1 function may be involved in oncogenic transformation of CML partially via the down-regulation of p27/Kip1 proteins.","['Komatsu, Norio', 'Watanabe, Tomoko', 'Uchida, Mie', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Kirito, Keita', 'Kikuchi, Satoru', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke', 'Endo, Hitoshi', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Komatsu N', 'Watanabe T', 'Uchida M', 'Mori M', 'Kirito K', 'Kikuchi S', 'Liu Q', 'Tauchi T', 'Miyazawa K', 'Endo H', 'Nagai T', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan. nkomatsu@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211562200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86638-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Feb 21;278(8):6411-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211562200.

However, only recently has the welfare of adolescent cancer sufferers gained momentum, including their infertility, and unsurprisingly relatively little is known about their semen quality and feasibility of cryopreservation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 238 adolescent cancer patients referred to our centre between 1991 and 2000, from post-pubertal age up to 19 years 11.9 months, were included. Their semen was processed after appropriate counselling. Semen cryopreservation was possible in 205 of the initial 238 patients referred (86.1%). The pathology of the cancer cases included Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), testicular, leukaemia, and others. The mean sperm counts were broadly uniform across the disease and age groups, except for the AML group. There was no cancer group analysed in which sperm could not be stored. Semen volume was broadly uniform across the disease groups, except the ALL and Ewing's sarcoma groups, which showed relatively lower and higher mean semen volumes respectively. Older adolescent patients appeared to have a higher mean semen volume. CONCLUSIONS: Semen cryopreservation was possible in most adolescent cancer cases regardless of age or diagnosis. In all cases the quality of the semen was potentially useful for assisted conception procedures. An offer to freeze sperm in all patients aged >12 years should be made. Adequate support and counselling of both the boys and their parents is essential.","['Bahadur, G', 'Ling, K L E', 'Hart, R', 'Ralph, D', 'Wafa, R', 'Ashraf, A', 'Jaman, N', 'Mahmud, S', 'Oyede, A W']","['Bahadur G', 'Ling KL', 'Hart R', 'Ralph D', 'Wafa R', 'Ashraf A', 'Jaman N', 'Mahmud S', 'Oyede AW']","['Royal Free and University College Medical School, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, UCL/University College Hospitals Trust, Rosenheim Building, 25 Grafton Way, London WC1E 6DB. g.bahadur@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Counseling', '*Cryopreservation', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/therapy', 'Semen/*physiology', '*Semen Preservation', 'Sperm Count', 'Testicular Neoplasms/therapy']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/17.12.3157 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2002 Dec;17(12):3157-61. doi: 10.1093/humrep/17.12.3157.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because LBL is similar to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, some centers prefer allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (SC) transplantation to autologous SC transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for patients who underwent autologous (auto, n = 128) or HLA-identical sibling (allo, n = 76) SC transplantations from 1989 to 1998 and were reported to International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) or Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry (ABMTR). Allo stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients had higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months (18% versus 3%, P =.002), and this disadvantage persisted at 1 and 5 years. Early relapse rates after alloSC transplantation and autoSC transplantation were similar, but significantly lower relapse rates were observed in alloSCT recipients at 1 and 5 years (32% versus 46%, P =.05; and 34% versus 56%, P =.004, respectively). No differences were noted in lymphoma-free survival rates between alloSC transplantations and autoSC transplantations (5-year rates 36% versus 39%, P =.82). AutoSCT recipients had higher overall survival at 6 months (75% versus 59%, P =.01), but survival did not significantly differ between the 2 groups at 1 and 5 years (60% versus 49%, P =.09; 44% versus 39%, P =.47, respectively). Multivariate analyses to account for confounding factors confirmed these results. Independent of SCT type, BM involvement at the time of transplantation and disease status more advanced than first complete remission were associated with inferior outcomes. In summary, alloSC transplantation for LBL is associated with fewer relapses than with autoSC transplantation, but higher TRM offsets any potential survival benefit.","['Levine, John E', 'Harris, Richard E', 'Loberiza, Fausto R Jr', 'Armitage, James O', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Van Besien, Koen', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Gibson, John', 'Goldstein, Steve C', 'Laughlin, Mary J', 'Lister, John', 'Marks, David I', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Miller, Alan M', 'Milone, Gustavo A', 'Pavlovsky, Santiago', 'Pecora, Amdrew L', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Zhang, Mei Jie']","['Levine JE', 'Harris RE', 'Loberiza FR Jr', 'Armitage JO', 'Vose JM', 'Van Besien K', 'Lazarus HM', 'Horowitz MM', 'Bashey A', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Burns LJ', 'Cairo MS', 'Champlin RE', 'Freytes CO', 'Gibson J', 'Goldstein SC', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Lister J', 'Marks DI', 'Maziarz RT', 'Miller AM', 'Milone GA', 'Pavlovsky S', 'Pecora AL', 'Rizzo JD', 'Schiller G', 'Schouten HC', 'Zhang MJ']","['University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, USA.']",['eng'],"['CP-21161/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-05-1483 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51128-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2476-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-05-1483.

We compared gene expression profiles of 4 ALCL (Karpas 299, SU-DHL-1, DEL, SR-786) and 3 HD cell lines and found that BCL3, which encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the I kappa B family of inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) transcriptional factors, was expressed at higher levels in ALCL than HD. Northern and Western blotting analyses confirmed the high-level expression of BCL3 in ALCL at both mRNA and protein levels. We established a real-time reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction assay to measure the BCL3 mRNA level and found a predominant level of BCL3 expression in t(2;5)(+) ALCL; the levels of cell lines and clinical materials were comparable to or higher than that of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia carrying t(14;19)(q32;q13). Southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization disclosed that the BCL3 gene copies were amplified in SU-DHL-1, whereas Karpas 299 carried 4 BCL3 gene loci. The BCL3 gene contains 2 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands, and the intragenic 3' CpG was entirely demethylated in SU-DHL-1 and DEL. In contrast to HD, in which NF-kappa B was constitutively activated, ALCL cells consistently showed (p50)(2) homodimer binding activity on electrophoretic mobility shift assay. It is suggested that the high-level nuclear Bcl-3 sequesters the (p50)(2) homodimer to the nucleus, which may account for the contradictory effect of CD30 stimulation on ALCL and HD.

Recent studies have shown that CD38 surface expression on the malignant cell clone may serve as a prognostic marker in that CD38(+) patients with B-CLL are characterized by advanced disease stage, lesser responsiveness to chemotherapy, and shorter survival than CD38(-) patients. To further investigate the molecular phenotype of these 2 clinical subgroups, we compared the gene expression profiles of CD38(+) (n = 25) with CD38(-) (n = 45) B-CLL patients using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays representative of approximately 5600 genes. The results showed that B-CLLs display a common gene expression profile that is largely independent of CD38 expression. Nonetheless, the expression of 14 genes differed significantly between the 2 groups, including genes that are involved in the regulation of cell survival. Furthermore, unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of 76 B-CLL samples led to the separation of 2 major subgroups, comprising 20 and 56 patients. Clustering to the smaller group was due in part to the coordinate high expression of a large number of ribosomal and other translation-associated genes, including elongation factors. Importantly, we found that patients with high expression of translation factors were characterized by a more favorable clinical course with significantly longer progression-free survival and reduced chemotherapy requirements than the remaining patients (P <.05). Our data show that gene expression profiling can help identify B-CLL subtypes with different clinical characteristics. Furthermore, our results suggest a role of translation-associated genes in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Durig, Jan', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Huttmann, Andreas', 'Kruse, Elisabeth', 'Holter, Tanja', 'Halfmeyer, Katja', 'Fuhrer, Anja', 'Rudolph, Roland', 'Kalhori, Naser', 'Nusch, Arnd', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Moroy, Tarik', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich']","['Durig J', 'Nuckel H', 'Huttmann A', 'Kruse E', 'Holter T', 'Halfmeyer K', 'Fuhrer A', 'Rudolph R', 'Kalhori N', 'Nusch A', 'Deaglio S', 'Malavasi F', 'Moroy T', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Hematology, Medical Faculty, University of Essen, Germany. duerig@t-online.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2683 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51166-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2748-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2683.

Two patients who had been treated with intramuscular injections of pegylated bovine ADA (PEG-ADA) for 2 to 4 years were enrolled in this trial and each received a total of approximately 10(11) cells in 11 or 12 infusions over a period of about 2 years. No adverse events were observed. During and after treatment, the patients continued to receive PEG-ADA, although at a reduced dose. Ten years after the last cell infusion, approximately 20% of the first patient's lymphocytes still carry and express the retroviral gene, indicating that the effects of gene transfer can be remarkably long lasting. On the contrary, the persistence of gene-marked cells is very low (< 0.1%), and no expression of the transgene is detectable in lymphocytes from the second patient who developed persisting antibodies to components of the gene transfer system. Data collected from these original patients have provided novel information about the longevity of T lymphocytes in humans and persistence of gene expression in vivo from vectors driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. This long-term follow-up has also provided unique evidence supporting the safety of retroviral-mediated gene transfer and illustrates clear examples of both the potential and the pitfalls of gene therapy in humans.","['Muul, Linda Mesler', 'Tuschong, Laura M', 'Soenen, Sherry Lau', 'Jagadeesh, G Jayashree', 'Ramsey, W Jay', 'Long, Zhifeng', 'Carter, Charles S', 'Garabedian, Elizabeth K', 'Alleyne, Melinna', 'Brown, Margaret', 'Bernstein, Wendy', 'Schurman, Shepherd H', 'Fleisher, Thomas A', 'Leitman, Susan F', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Blaese, R Michael', 'Candotti, Fabio']","['Muul LM', 'Tuschong LM', 'Soenen SL', 'Jagadeesh GJ', 'Ramsey WJ', 'Long Z', 'Carter CS', 'Garabedian EK', 'Alleyne M', 'Brown M', 'Bernstein W', 'Schurman SH', 'Fleisher TA', 'Leitman SF', 'Dunbar CE', 'Blaese RM', 'Candotti F']","['Clinical Gene Therapy Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. muul1@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'HW3H7D91F6 (pegademase bovine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', '*Antibody Formation', 'Cattle', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2003/05/22 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2800 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51141-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Apr 1;101(7):2563-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2800.

Recent studies have suggested a prominent role for mast cells in host defense. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a common airway pathogen, Moraxella catarrhalis and a commensal bacterium, Neiserria cinerea, on activation of human mast cells. Human mast cell leukemia cells (HMC-1) were activated with either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore or with varying concentrations of heat-killed suspensions of bacteria. Supernatants were assayed for the cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Nuclear proteins were isolated and assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) nuclear binding activity. In some experiments, NF-kappaB inhibitor, Bay-11 was added to determine functional significance. Both M. catarrhalis and N. cinerea induced mast cell activation and selective secretion of two key inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and MCP-1. This was accompanied by NF-kappaB activation. Neither spun bacterial supernatants nor bacterial lipopolysaccharide induced cytokine secretion, suggesting need for direct bacterial contact with mast cells. Scanning electron microscopy revealed active aggregation of bacteria over mast cell surfaces. The NF-kappaB inhibitor, Bay-11, inhibited expression of MCP-1. These findings suggest the possibility of direct interactions between human mast cells and common bacteria and provide evidence for a novel role for human mast cells in innate immunity.","['Krishnaswamy, G', 'Martin, R', 'Walker, E', 'Li, C', 'Hossler, F', 'Hall, K', 'Chi, D S']","['Krishnaswamy G', 'Martin R', 'Walker E', 'Li C', 'Hossler F', 'Hall K', 'Chi DS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, Tennessee 37614-1709, USA. krishnas@etsu.edu']",['eng'],"['AI-43310/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-63072/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Moraxella catarrhalis/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Neisseria cinerea/immunology']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2004/02/03 05:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2741/988 [doi]'],epublish,Front Biosci. 2003 Jan 1;8:a40-7. doi: 10.2741/988.,,,,,,20030101,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time- and age-adjusted relative risk models were fitted to the Japanese atomic-bomb survivor mortality data, taking account of the modifying effects of acute injury status and adjusting for random dosimetric errors. RESULTS: For leukaemia, there were statistically significantly higher relative risks among those persons reporting either epilation (two-sided p=0.03) or burns (two-sided p=0.02), but after adjustment is made for the effects of dosimetric error these results become statistically non-significant (two-sided p>0.05) For all other endpoints (cancers other than leukaemia, benign neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, non-cancer and non-cardiovascular disease) there were no statistically significant modifying effects on relative risk of acute injury status, whether or not adjustment is made for the effects of dosimetric error. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from leukaemia, there are generally no indications for cancer or other disease endpoints of variations in dose-response by acute injury status. The increased risks observed for leukaemia among those reporting epilation or burns are much diminished after adjustment for dosimetric error, and so there is no strong evidence of a sensitive subgroup within the Life Span Study cohort.","['Little, Mark P']",['Little MP'],"[""Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK. mark.little@ic.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alopecia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Burns/epidemiology/etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/classification/complications/*mortality', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time']",,2002/11/29 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0955300021000013803 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2002 Nov;78(11):1001-10. doi: 10.1080/0955300021000013803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, t(14;18) also has been reported in rare cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In 2215 cases of CLL studied by conventional cytogenetics in our institution, we identified 2 cases of CLL carrying t(14;18). Both patients were men, aged 52 and 71 years at the time of diagnosis. One patient presented with leukemia and the other primarily with nodal disease. In addition to t(14;18), trisomy 12 (+12) was identified in the same clone in both cases. Atypical morphologic features were identified: case 1 contained more than 15% lymphoid cells with cleaved nuclei, whereas case 2 contained more than 15% plasmacytoid lymphoid cells. The immunophenotype of case 2 was also unusual for CLL, showing weak CD23 expression and FMC7 positivity. We identified 6 other t(14;18)-carrying CLL cases in the literature; 2 had t(14;18) as the sole abnormality and 2 contained +12 as the additional abnormality. To conclude, cases of CLL carrying t(14;18) are exceedingly rare, and +12 appears to be the most common cytogenetic abnormality coexisting with t(14;18) in CLL.","['Sen, Filiz', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Sen F', 'Lai R', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

Examination revealed a large, smooth, circumscribed, tan mass located at the cranial border of the right kidney. Microscopically, the mass consisted almost entirely of well-differentiated ganglion cells mixed with satellite and Schwann cells within a neurofibrillar matrix. The cells displaced the adrenal medulla and were partially surrounded by a thin rim of compressed adrenal cortex. Focal areas of hemorrhage and infiltrates of leukemic mononuclear cells were evident throughout the mass, but pheochromocytes were not detected. On the basis of findings during histologic examination, a diagnosis of adrenal medullary ganglioneuroma was made. Mononuclear cell leukemia was also diagnosed in the adrenal gland and was evident in lymphoid organs such as the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Ganglioneuroma is rarely seen in rats and can be differentiated from more common complex pheochromocytomas, which consist of fewer neural components (< 80% of the mass). In rats, ganglioneuromas can develop in the central nervous system, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. Differential diagnoses for a primary neoplasm of the adrenal gland should include carcinomas and adenomas of the adrenal cortex, and pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas of the adrenal medulla.","['Goelz, Mary', 'Dixon, Darlene', 'Myers, Page', 'Clark, James', 'Forsythe, Diane']","['Goelz M', 'Dixon D', 'Myers P', 'Clark J', 'Forsythe D']","['Comparative Medicine Branch, The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Contemp Top Lab Anim Sci,Contemporary topics in laboratory animal science,9204153,,,,,2002/11/29 04:00,2002/11/29 04:00,['2002/11/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/11/29 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Contemp Top Lab Anim Sci. 1998 Mar;37(2):75-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
