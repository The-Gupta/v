Primary and secondary end points were end of consolidation minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity and event-free survival. METHODS: 392 patients were randomized to experimental and 396 to standard therapy. Patients allocated to standard therapy received oral 6-mercaptopurine (25 mg/m(2) /day) from days 30 to 85, while the experimental arm received stepwise increments of additional 25 mg/m(2) /day beginning on days 50 and/or 71 unless dose-limiting myelosuppression had occurred. RESULTS: In the experimental arm, 166 patients (42%) received one dose increment, and 62 (16%) received two. Fifty-seven of 387 (15%) patients in the experimental arm were MRD positive at end of consolidation vs 77 of 389 (20%) in the control arm (P = .08). Five-year probability of event-free survival was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93) in the experimental arm vs 0.93 (0.90-0.96) in the control arm (P = .13). The median accumulated length of 6-mercaptopurine treatment interruptions was 7 (IQR 2-12) in the experimental arm vs 4 (IQR 0-10) in the control arm (P = .002).

Epub 2017 Nov 9.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with the conventional cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (CY/TBI) regimen is an essential therapeutic strategy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults. Medium-dose etoposide (VP16, 30-40 mg/kg) can be added to intensify this CY/TBI regimen and reduce relapse; however, differences in prognosis between the VP16/CY/TBI and CY/TBI regimens have not yet been fully analyzed. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese transplant registry database to compare the prognosis between the VP16/CY/TBI (VP16, total 30-40 mg/kg) (N = 376) and CY/TBI (N = 1178) regimens in adult patients with ALL transplanted at complete remission (CR) between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2014. Our analyses indicated that VP16/CY/TBI significantly reduced relapse compared with CY/TBI (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.00; P = .05) with a corresponding improvement in leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95%CI, 0.62-0.93; P = .01), particularly in patients transplanted at CR1 with advanced-risk (positive minimal residual disease, presence of poor-risk cytogenetics, or an initial elevated leukocyte count) (HR, 0.75; 95%CI, 0.56-1.00; P = .05) or those transplanted beyond CR2 (HR, 0.58; 95%CI, 0.39-0.88; P = .01). The addition of VP16 did not increase post-transplant complications or nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.65-1.18; P = .38). This study is the first to reveal the efficacy of the addition of medium-dose VP16 to CY/TBI in high-risk ALL. To establish new myeloablative conditioning regimens including VP16, a large-scale prospective study is necessary.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent epidemiological study suggests that children with ASD might have an increased cancer risk. CASE PRESENTATION: The 14.5-year-old boy, previously diagnosed with ASD, was referred with persistent bone pain. Diagnostic work-up confirmed diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); cytogenetic analysis revealed low hypodiploid karyotype with a mutation (c.733G>A, p.Gly245Ser, rs28934575) in TP53 in the leukemic blasts. By Sanger sequencing, the presence of this mutation in the germline was subsequently confirmed and, thus, diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was made. His family history was remarkable with two siblings with intellectual disability and a mother who has died of premenopausal breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes causing cancer susceptibility syndromes overlap with those involved in autism. This functional overlap between autism and cancer is novel and particularly compelling. The surprising coincidence of LFS and ASD in our patient raises the question whether this is purely coincidental or mechanistically associated.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autism spectrum disorder', 'Hypodiploid leukemia', 'Li-Fraumeni syndrome']",PMC5629188,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 5.,"Rituximab (MabThera((R))/Rituxan((R))), a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen CD20, was the first therapeutic antibody to enter clinical practice for the treatment of cancer. As monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, rituximab has been shown to prolong progression-free survival and, in some indications overall survival, in patients with various B-cell malignancies, while having a well-established and manageable safety profile and a wide therapeutic window. As a result, rituximab is considered to have revolutionized treatment practices for patients with B-cell malignancies. A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of rituximab has been developed, comprising the same monoclonal antibody as the originally marketed formulation [rituximab concentrate for solution for intravenous (IV) infusion], and has undergone a detailed, sequential clinical development program. This program demonstrated that, at fixed doses, rituximab SC achieves non-inferior serum trough concentrations in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with comparable efficacy and safety relative to the IV formulation. The added benefit of rituximab SC was demonstrated in dedicated studies showing that rituximab SC allows for simplified and shortened drug preparation and administration times resulting in a reduced treatment burden for patients as well as improved resource utilization (efficiency) at the treatment facility. The improved efficiency of delivering rituximab's benefit to patients may broaden patient access to rituximab therapy in areas with low levels of healthcare resources, including IV-chair capacity constraints.

We summarized recent genetic data that may guide future efforts towards implementing risk-adapted therapy based on mutational profile and improving disease control and survival of affected patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent genetic data in CNL and aCML prompted modifications to the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria, which have improved our understanding of how CNL and aCML are different diseases despite sharing common findings of peripheral granulocytosis and marrow myeloid hyperplasia. The overlap of recurrently mutated genes between aCML and CMML support considering CSF3R-T618I mutated cases as a distinct entity, either as CNL or CNL with dysplasia.

Epub 2017 Oct 5.,"Rituximab is a human/murine, chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with established efficacy, and a favorable and well-defined safety profile in patients with various CD20-expressing lymphoid malignancies, including indolent and aggressive forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Since its first approval 20 years ago, intravenously administered rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies and has become a standard component of care for follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma. For all of these diseases, clinical trials have demonstrated that rituximab not only prolongs the time to disease progression but also extends overall survival. Efficacy benefits have also been shown in patients with marginal zone lymphoma and in more aggressive diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma. Although the proven clinical efficacy and success of rituximab has led to the development of other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in recent years (e.g., obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, veltuzumab, and ocrelizumab), rituximab is likely to maintain a position within the therapeutic armamentarium because it is well established with a long history of successful clinical use. Furthermore, a subcutaneous formulation of the drug has been approved both in the EU and in the USA for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Using the wealth of data published on rituximab during the last two decades, we review the preclinical development of rituximab and the clinical experience gained in the treatment of hematologic B-cell malignancies, with a focus on the well-established intravenous route of administration.

The benefit of early treatment is currently unclear, and treatment may be held until the disease exhibits accelerated blast counts or the patient becomes symptomatic. Optimal treatments for CMML are not well defined. Conventional treatments include hydroxyurea, cytarabine, and hypomethylating agents. However, all treatment options are limited and, with the exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, are considered palliative.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nationwide cohort included patients who were diagnosed with HCC and received LT from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. We analyzed frequency and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to estimate the risk of SPC in HCC patients after LT. RESULTS: A total of 2462 patients who were diagnosed with HCC and received LT were confirmed. Of these patients, 103 (4.2%) developed SPC after LT; the most common cancer site was lung (16.5%). Patients with HCC receiving LT had high risk of SPC [SIR 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27-3.38], particularly lymphoma (SIR 9.26), myeloma (SIR 10.60), and bladder cancer (SIR 7.19). The 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month overall survival for patients with HCC after LT was 92.7, 87.8, 84.6, and 82.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients with LT had longer life expectancy and higher risk for SPC compared with the general population. Therefore, close surveillance for SPC is important in patients with HCC receiving LT.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Liver transplantation', 'Second primary cancer', 'South Korea']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 27.,"Hydroquinone (HQ), a major reactive metabolite of benzene, contributes to benzeneinduced leukemia. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this activity remain to be elucidated. Poly ADPribosylation (PARylation) is a type of reversible posttranslational modification that is performed by enzymes in the PAR polymerase (PARP) family and mediates different biological processes, including apoptosis. Zona occludens 2 (ZO2) is a tight junction scaffold protein, which is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The present study investigated the activity and mechanisms regulated by PARP1 during HQinduced apoptosis using TK6 lymphoblastoid cells and PARP1silenced TK6 cells. The results revealed that exposure to 10 microM HQ for 72 h induced apoptosis in TK6 cells and that apoptosis was attenuated in PARP1silenced TK6 cells. In cells treated with HQ, inhibition of PARP1 increased the expression of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), increased ATP production and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production relative to the levels observed in cells treated with HQ alone. Colocalization of ZO2 and PAR (or PARP1 protein) was determined using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The findings of the present study revealed that ZO2 was PARylated via an interaction with PARP1, which was consistent with an analysis of protein expression that was performed using western blot analysis, which determined that ZO2 protein expression was upregulated in HQtreated control cells and downregulated in HQtreated PARP1silenced TK6 cells. These findings indicated that prolonged exposure to a low dose of HQ induced TK6 cells to undergo apoptosis, whereas inhibiting PARP1 attenuates cellular apoptosis by activating Bcl2 and energysaving processes and reducing ROS. The present study determined that PARP1 was involved in HQinduced apoptosis by PARylation of ZO2.",,,,PMC5779892,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcellspecific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 protein (Bmi1) has been reported to be associated with the initiation and progression of osteosarcoma, and as a prognostic indicator in the clinic. In the current study, a fulllength antibody targeting Bmi1 (AbBmi1) was produced and the preclinical value of Bmi1targeted therapy was evaluated in bone carcinoma cells and tumor xenograft mice. The results indicated that the Bmi1 expression level was markedly upregulated in bone cancer cell lines, and inhibition of Bmi1 by AbBmi1 reduced the invasiveness and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression of Bmi1 promoted proliferation and angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis resistance induced by cisplatin via the nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB) signal pathway. In addition, AbBmi1 treatment inhibited the tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells in vivo. Furthermore, AbBmi1 blocked NFkappaB signaling and reduced MMP9 expression. Furthermore, Bmi1 promoted osteosarcoma tumor growth, whereas AbBmi1 significantly inhibited osteosarcoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Notably, AbBmi1 decreased the percentages of Ki67positive cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelingpositive cells in tumors compared with Bmi1treated and PBS controls. Notably, MMP9 and NFkappaB expression were downregulated by treatment with AbBmi1 in MG63 osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion, the data provides evidence that AbBmi1 inhibited the progression of osteosarcoma, suggesting that AbBmi1 may be a novel anticancer agent through the inhibition of Bmi1 via activating the NFkappaB pathway in osteosarcoma.",,,,PMC5779877,,,,,,,,,,,,

After BMT, he showed a remarkable reduction in psychotic symptoms without administration of neuroleptics. He also showed drastic improvement in social functioning. Follow-up evaluations 2 and 4 years after BMT showed persistent significant improvement of the psychotic state and social functioning. Recent findings show that the major underlying pathogenic mechanism of schizophrenia is immune dysregulation.

Further studies are required to define the true benefits of BMT for the possible curative treatment of schizophrenia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'cellular therapy', 'curative treatment', 'immune alterations', 'maternal immune activation', 'schizophrenia']",PMC5613125,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human cancer virus to be described, and its discovery paved the way for further investigations into the oncogenic potential of viruses. In the decades following the discovery of EBV, multinational research efforts led to the discovery of further viral causes of various human cancers. Lymphomas are perhaps the cancer type that is most closely associated with oncogenic viruses: infection with EBV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8, and hepatitis C virus have all been associated with lymphomagenesis. Lymphomas have also played an important role in the history of oncoviruses, as both the first human oncovirus (EBV) and the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) were discovered through isolates taken from patients with unique lymphoma syndromes. The history of the discovery of these 2 key oncoviruses is presented here, and their impact on further medical research, using the specific example of HIV research, is briefly discussed.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Burkitt lymphoma', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'history', 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1']",PMC5621661,,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 5.,"In the European Intergroup EURO-LB02 trial, children and adolescents with lymphoblastic lymphoma underwent the non-Hodgkin lymphoma Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol without prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. The primary aims of this trial were to test whether replacing prednisone with dexamethasone during induction increases event-free survival in the subgroups with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and whether therapy duration could be reduced from 24 to 18 months (factorial design, randomizations). These questions could not be answered due to premature closure of the trial. Here we report on the secondary aims of the trial: whether the results of the NHL-BFM90 study could be reproduced and evaluation of disease features and prognostic factors. Three hundred and nineteen patients (66 with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 233 with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 12 with mixed phenotype, 8 not classifiable) were enrolled. In induction, 215 patients received prednisone and 104 patients received dexamethasone. The median follow-up was 6.8 years (range, 3.0-10.3). The 5-year event-free survival was 82+/-2% [12 toxic deaths, 5 secondary malignancies, 43 non-response/relapse (central nervous system n=9; all received prednisone during induction)]. The event-free survival rate was 80+/-5% for patients with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 82+/-3% for those with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 100% for patients with a mixed phenotype. During induction, significantly more grade III/IV toxicities were observed in patients receiving dexamethasone, resulting in significant treatment delays. The number of toxic deaths did not differ significantly. The only variable associated with outcome was performance status at diagnosis. The 90% event-free survival rate for patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma shown in study NHL-BFM90 was not replicated, mainly due to more toxic deaths and central nervous system relapses. Dexamethasone in induction may prevent central nervous system relapse more effectively than prednisone but produces a higher burden of toxicity.

Epub 2017 Aug 9.,"Novel therapies are needed to overcome chemotherapy resistance for children with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moxetumomab pasudotox is a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin. A multicenter phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated cumulative dose (MTCD) and evaluate safety, activity, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of moxetumomab pasudotox in children, adolescents, and young adults with ALL (N = 55). Moxetumomab pasudotox was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion at doses of 5 to 50 microg/kg every other day for 6 (cohorts A and B) or 10 (cohort C) doses in 21-day cycles. Cohorts B and C received dexamethasone prophylaxis against capillary leak syndrome (CLS). The most common treatment-related adverse events were reversible weight gain, hepatic transaminase elevation, and hypoalbuminemia. Dose-limiting CLS occurred in 2 of 4 patients receiving 30 microg/kg of moxetumomab pasudotox every other day for 6 doses. Incorporation of dexamethasone prevented further dose-limiting CLS. Six of 14 patients receiving 50 microg/kg of moxetumomab pasudotox for 10 doses developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), or HUS-like events, exceeding the MTCD. Treatment expansion at 40 microg/kg for 10 doses (n = 11) exceeded the MTCD because of 2 HUS/TMA/HUS-like events. Dose level 6B (ie, 50 microg/kg x 6 doses) was the MTCD, selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. Among 47 evaluable patients, an objective response rate of 32% was observed, including 11 (23%) composite complete responses, 5 of which were minimal residual disease negative by flow cytometry. Moxetumomab pasudotox showed a manageable safety profile and evidence of activity in relapsed or refractory childhood ALL.

We examined whether RT usage following the CALGB publication had decreased over time and evaluated sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with RT omission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the National Cancer Data Base, we analyzed a cohort of 120,308 women aged 70 years or older with stage I, ER-positive breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy. Patients were classified into two groups based on the time of CALGB 9343 publication: (i) pre-CALGB (up to 2004), and (ii) post-CALGB (2005-2012). Clinicopathological and sociodemographic variables were compared between pre- and post-CALGB groups. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression were employed, with the omission of adjuvant RT as the primary outcome in the regression analysis. RESULTS: Radiation therapy usage decreased by 4.1% after CALGB publication (on average 71.6% pre-CALGB vs. 67.5% post-CALGB; p<0.0001). Almost one-third of women aged >/=85 years received RT in the post-CALGB group. In a multivariable model, the variables significantly associated with increased odds for omission of RT in the post-CALGB group were: advanced age, African-American, increased great circle distance, therapy under academic research program, residents of East South-Central region, living in a rural population <2,500 not adjacent to a metropolitan area, low income level, Medicaid recipients, high comorbidity index, small tumor, well-differentiated histology, residual tumor, and lack of receipt of chemotherapy and anti-hormonal therapy. CONCLUSION: During the study period, the CALGB trial publication had a minimal impact on the rate of adjuvant RT use among elderly women with small, ER-positive breast cancers.

In Jurkat cells, PKB is constitutively active and phosphorylated at the activation-loop residue (Thr308). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), an enzyme that also contains a PH domain, catalyses Thr308 phosphorylation of PKB in addition to other kinase families such as PKC isoforms. It is unknown, however, whether the loss of PTEN in Jurkat cells also results in unregulated PDK1 activity and whether such loss has an impact on activation-loop phosphorylation of other PDK1 substrates e.g. PKC. In this study, we addressed whether loss of PTEN in Jurkat cells affects PDK1 catalytic activity and intracellular localization. We demonstrated that reducing the level of 3-phosphoinositides in Jurkat cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or expression of PTEN does not affect PDK1 activity or its intracellular localization. We conclude, therefore, that although Jurkat cells lack PTEN expression, only a subset of pathways downstream of PDK1 are perturbed as a consequence of PTEN loss.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Jurkat cells', '*PDK1', '*PI3K', '*PTEN', '*protein phosphorylation']",,,,,['Anticancer Res. 2017 Nov;37(11):6496.

Whilst the importance of clinical trials in informing best practice is well established, data regarding individual patient benefit are scarce. We have investigated the association between overall survival and trial recruitment in TYA patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: National (England) TYA patients treated for ALL. PARTICIPANTS: 511 patients aged 15-24 years diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2010 inclusive, of whom 239 (46.7%) participated in the UKALL2003 trial. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were identified using National Clinical Trial (UKALL2003) and Cancer Registry (National Cancer Data Repository, English National Cancer Online Registration Environment) Databases. Relative survival rates were calculated for trial and non-trial patients and observed differences were modelled using a multiple regression approach. The numbers and percentages of deaths in those patients included in the survival analysis were determined for each 3-month period, p values were calculated using the two-tailed z-test for difference between proportions and 95% CIs for percentage deaths were derived using the binomial distribution based on the Wilson Score method. RESULTS: Patients treated on the trial had a 17.9% better 2-year survival (85.4% vs 67.5%, p<0.001) and 8.9% better 1-year survival (90.8% vs 81.9%, p=0.004) than those not on the trial. 35 (14.6%) patients recruited to the trial died in the 2 years following diagnosis compared with 86 (32.6%) of those not recruited (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TYA patients recruited to the clinical trial UKALL 2003 in England had a lower risk of mortality and a higher overall survival than contemporaneous non-trial patients. These data underline the potential for individual patient benefit in participating in a clinical trial and the importance of international efforts to increase trial participation in the TYA age group.

Bim is expressed in nonapoptotic cells at the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is activated by largely unknown mechanisms. We found that Bim is regulated by formation of large protein complexes containing dynein light chain 1 (DLC1). Bim rapidly inserted into cardiolipin-containing membranes in vitro and recruited DLC1 to the membrane. Bim binding to DLC1 induced the formation of large Bim complexes on lipid vesicles, on isolated mitochondria, and in intact cells. Native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration showed Bim-containing mitochondrial complexes of several hundred kilodaltons in all cells tested. Bim unable to form complexes was consistently more active than complexed Bim, which correlated with its substantially reduced binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. At endogenous levels, Bim surprisingly bound only anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, recruiting only Mcl-1 into large complexes. Targeting of DLC1 by RNAi in human cell lines induced disassembly of Bim-Mcl-1 complexes and the proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 and sensitized the cells to the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor ABT-737. Regulation of apoptosis at mitochondria thus extends beyond the interaction of monomers of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members but involves more complex structures of proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane, and targeting complexes may be a novel therapeutic strategy.",['(c) 2017 Singh et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*BH3-only', '*Bcl-2', '*Bim', '*DLC1, DYNLL1', '*apoptosis', '*complexes']",PMC5666674,,,,,,,,,,,,

Publicly available AML databases were mined for SHB gene expression and patient survival. SHB gene expression was determined in the Uppsala cohort of AML patients by qPCR. Cell proliferation was determined after SHB gene knockdown in leukemic cell lines. Despite a low frequency of SHB gene mutations, many tumors overexpressed SHB mRNA compared with normal myeloid blood cells. AML patients with tumors expressing low SHB mRNA displayed longer survival times. A subgroup of AML exhibiting a favorable prognosis, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a PMLRARA translocation, expressed less SHB mRNA than AML tumors in general. When examining genes co-expressed with SHB in AML tumors, four other genes ( PAX5, HDAC7, BCORL1, TET1) related to leukemia were identified. A network consisting of these genes plus SHB was identified that relates to certain phenotypic characteristics, such as immune cell, vascular and apoptotic features. SHB knockdown in the APL PMLRARA cell line NB4 and the monocyte/macrophage cell line MM6 adversely affected proliferation, linking SHB gene expression to tumor cell expansion and consequently to patient survival. It is concluded that tumor SHB gene expression relates to AML survival and its subgroup APL.

The CD150 receptor was colocalized with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and early endosomes. In contrast, CD180 was detected preferentially in early endosomes. Analysis of CD150 isoforms differential expression revealed that regardless of CD150 cell surface expression the mCD150 isoform with two ITSM signaling motifs was a predominant CD150 isoform in CLL B cells. The majority of CLL cases had significantly elevated expression level of the soluble sCD150, moreover CLL B cells secrete this isoform. CD150 or CD180 crosslinking on CLL B cells alone led to activation of Akt, mTORC1, ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK1/2 networks. Both CD150 and CD180 target the translation machinery through mTOR independent as well as mTOR dependent pathways. Moreover, both these receptors transmit pro-survival signals via Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK3beta and FOXO1/FOXO3a. Unexpectedly, coligation CD150 and CD180 receptors on CLL B cells led to mutual inhibition of the Akt and MAPK pathways. While CD150 and CD180 coligation resulted in reduced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, c-Jun, RSK, p70S6K, S6RP, and 4E-BP; it led to complete blocking of mTOR and p38MAPK phosphorylation. At the same time coligation of CD150 and CD40 receptors did not result in Akt and MAPK inhibition. This suggests that combination of signals via CD150 and CD180 leads to blocking of pro-survival pathways that may be a restraining factor for neoplastic CLL B cells propagation in more than 50% of CLL cases where these receptors are coexpressed.",,,,PMC5628907,['R01 AI052203/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To understand specific molecular characteristics of different MDS subtypes with del(5q), we analyzed the gene expression profiles of CD34+ cells from MDS patients of different databases and its enriched pathways. 44 genes, such as MME and RAG1, and eight related pathways were identified to be commonly changed, indicating their conserved roles in MDS development. Additionally, U43604 was identified to be specifically changed in three subtypes with del(5q), including refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). C10orf10 and CD79B were specifically changed in RA patients with del(5q), while POU2AF1 were in RARS patients with del(5q). We also analyzed specific pathways of MDS subtypes, such as ""Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin sulfate"" which was specific identified in RARS patients. Importantly, those findings can be validated well using another MDS database.

METHODS: Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay and apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to determine expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, P21, P15 and DNMT1 as well as levels of histone H3 acetylation, histone H3K9 mono- di- and tri-methylation. RESULTS: BIX-01294 inhibits expression of Bcl-2, upregulates expression of Bax and caspase-3 and induces cell apoptosis. BIX-01294 upregulates cell cycle inhibitor P21 expression and induces cell cycle arrest in the phase G0/G1. Furthermore, BIX-01294 suppresses expression of DNA demethylase DNMT1 and promotes expression of tumor suppressor protein P15, thereby inhibiting proliferation of MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells. BIX-01294 downregulates histone H3K9 mono- and di-methylation levels and has no effect on H3K9 trimethylation and histone H3 acetylation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that by regulating H3K9 methylation and cell cycle, BIX-01294 inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

METHODS: A total of 170 ALL patients (patient group) and 1241 unrelated healthy bone marrow donors (control group) were genotyped at a high-resolution level using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT), sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSO) and sequence specific primer (SSP) typing methods. Frequencies of HLA alleles and haplotypes were calculated with Arlequin 3.5.2 software. The distribution of genes and haplotypes were analyzed through a case-control study, and the odd ratio (OR) of ALL was also calculated. RESULTS: By cha-square test and correction, an increased frequency of B*13:01 and B*40:02 among ALL patients was discovered in comparison with the controls (7.35% vs. 4.63%, P=0.030; 2.94% vs. 1.45%, P=0.042), whereas B*35:03 and B*46:01 were less frequent compared with the controls (0.29% vs. 1.69%, P=0.048; 4.41% vs. 7.82%, P=0.025). Although the above discrepancies were not statistically significant by Bonferroni correction, within DRB1*15 group, the frequency of DRB1*15:01 in ALL patients was significantly greater than that of the controls (16.18% vs. 10.19%, Pc'=0.041) and was correlated with ALL (OR=1.70, 95% CI:1.24-2.33). Nineteen haplotypes identified in the ALL patients had a frequency greater than those of the controls. Of these, 11 were absent from the control group and were correlated with ALL. CONCLUSION: The association of HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 polymorphisms with ALL was determined among patients from northern Chinese Hans. The correlation between DRB1*15:01 and ALL suggested that DRB1*15:01 may be a susceptibility gene for ALL with its particular haplotypes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As herpesvirus genomes enter the nucleus as naked DNA, we asked whether the HIRA chaperone complex affects herpesvirus infection. After infection of primary cells with HSV or CMV, or transient transfection with naked plasmid DNA, HIRA re-localizes to PML bodies, sites of cellular anti-viral activity. HIRA co-localizes with viral genomes, binds to incoming viral and plasmid DNAs and deposits histone H3.3 onto these. Anti-viral interferons (IFN) specifically induce HIRA/PML co-localization at PML nuclear bodies and HIRA recruitment to IFN target genes, although HIRA is not required for IFN-inducible expression of these genes. HIRA is, however, required for suppression of viral gene expression, virus replication and lytic infection and restricts murine CMV replication in vivo.

Epub 2017 Nov 30.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication in paediatric oncology patients. To identify the incidence, risk factors and recurrence rate of VTE in paediatric oncology patients, an observational, retrospective cohort study of all consecutive children (</=18 years) with malignancies, treated at the Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Centre between January 1989 and December 2013, was done. A matched case-control study in children with lymphomas was performed, to identify thrombotic risk factors. Cumulative recurrence-free survival after first VTE was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 2,183 children included (male: female = 1.4:1.0; median age, 6.6 years) with cancer, 78 patients developed VTE (3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-4.4). The incidence increased from 0.8% (4/478, 95% CI, 0.0-1.6) between 1989 and 1993 to 10.4% (44/423, 95% CI, 7.6-13.4) between 2009 and 2013. Independent risk factors for VTE were age >/= 12 years, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoma. The case-control study in lymphoma patients showed a trend for increased VTE incidence in stage IV lymphoma. Twelve (15.4%) patients developed recurrent thrombosis, 7 patients while on therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. The cumulative recurrence-free survival after first VTE was 88.5, 87.1 and 80.6% after 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrated an increasing incidence of VTE in children with malignancies, with age >/= 12 years, ALL and lymphoma as independent risk factors. The elevated recurrence rate underlines the importance of full anticoagulant therapy and might warrant prophylactic anticoagulation after first VTE during cancer treatment.",['Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.'],,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Nov 1.,"Stem cells are proving to be a promising therapy for a wide range of pediatric disorders, from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy to pediatric leukemia. Owing to their low immunogenicity and ease of availability, umbilical cord blood (UCB) progenitor cells are increasingly replacing fetal- and adult-derived cells in therapeutic settings. Multiple environmental and demographic factors affect the number and type of stem cells extracted from UCB, and these differences have been associated with disparities in outcomes after transplantation. To avoid variations in efficacy, as well as the potential adverse effects of stem cell transplantation, evaluation of the stem cell secretome is critical to identify key paracrine signals released by the stem cells that could be used to provide similar neuroprotective effects to stem cell transplantation. This article describes the cell types found in UCB and reviews the available literature surrounding the effects of collection timing and volume, maternal risk factors, delivery characteristics, and neonatal demographics on the cellular composition of UCB. In addition, the current findings regarding the stem cell secretome are discussed to identify factors that could be used to supplement or replace stem cell transplantation in pediatric neuroprotection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2(HSV-1/2), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*EBV', '*HBV', '*HCV', '*HDV', '*HHV-8', '*HIV', '*HPV', '*HSV', '*HTLV', '*VZV', '*exhaustion', '*senescence', '*telomerase', '*telomere']",PMC5691640,['R01 CA201309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Nov 2.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related gene expression data mostly originate from unfractionated bulk samples, leading to ""expression averaging"" of heterogeneous populations. Multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) may distinguish heterogeneous populations based on the phenotypic characterization of single-cells, but is not applicable for RNA targets. Here, we evaluated the PrimeFlow RNA assay, a novel FCM-based assay designed to measure gene expressions, in two cancer entities with high and low RNA target levels. METHODS: Neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines were studied for MYCN gene expression by PrimeFlow and compared with the gold standard, RT-qPCR. Dilution series of NB cells (0.10-11%) were prepared to evaluate performance in small cell populations. Diagnostic material of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients was used to measure Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) expression in bulk leukemic cells and rare subsets, e.g. leukemic stem cells (LSCs). FCM analysis was performed on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) using Infinicyt (Cytognos((R)) ) for data analysis. mRNA expression was reported by normalized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values and staining indices. RESULTS: MYCN mRNA quantified by PrimeFlow significantly correlated with RT-qPCR and remained detectable in small (0.1%) populations. Using PrimeFlow(TM) , WT1 levels were shown to be significantly higher in AML patient samples with WT1 overexpression, previously defined by RT-qPCR. Moreover, WT1 overexpression was distinguishable between heterogeneous cell populations and remained measurable in rare LSCs. CONCLUSION: PrimeFlow is a sensitive technique to investigate mRNA expressions, with high concordance to RT-qPCR. High (MYCN) and subtle (WT1) overexpressed mRNA targets can be quantified in heterogeneous and rare subpopulations e.g. LSCs.

Allo-HCT recipients were younger (50 (14-74) vs. 67 (45-72) years, P = 0.01) and had 1-year and 3-year OS of 68% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 49-81%] and 58% (95% CI = 38-75%), respectively. Allo-HCT in first complete remission (CR1) yielded superior 3-year OS (versus not in CR1) [74% (95% CI = 48-89%) vs. 0, P < 0.0001]. Allo-HCT outcomes were not impacted by regimen intensity [3-year OS for myeloablative conditioning = 61% (95% CI = 28-83%) vs. reduced-intensity conditioning = 55% (95% CI = 28-76%)]. One-year OS for auto-HCT recipients was 11% (95% CI = 8-50%). These results demonstrate efficacy of allo-HCT in BPDCN, especially in patients in CR1. Pertaining to auto-HCT, our results suggest lack of efficacy against BPDCN, but this observation is limited by the small sample size. Larger prospective studies are needed to better define the role of HCT in BPDCN.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation', '*autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation', '*blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', '*survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, almost all studies of TP53 gene abnormality so far have been limited to mutation searches in the DNA binding domain. As there have been few reports examining both mutation and deletion over the full-length of the TP53 gene, the clinical characteristics of TP53 gene abnormality have not yet been clearly established. In this study, TP53 gene mutation was observed in 7.3% of the total 412 de novo AML cases (33 mutations in 30 cases), with mutation outside the DNA binding domain in eight cases (27%). TP53 gene deletion was observed in 3.1% of 358 cases. All cases had monoallelic deletion with TP53 gene mutation on the opposite allele. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TP53 gene mutation in the DNA binding domain and outside the DNA binding domain was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival among the total cohort and it is also an unfavorable prognostic factor in FLT3-ITD-negative AML cases aged 70 years or below with intermediate cytogenetic prognosis. In stratified treatment, full-length search for TP53 gene mutation is therefore very important.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Mutation', 'Prognostic factor', 'TP53', 'Whole-exome gene analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, determining the molecular drivers of these expression changes remains challenging. In ALL blasts, the p53 tumor suppressor is the primary regulator of the apoptotic response to genotoxic chemotherapy, which is predictive of outcome. Consequently, we hypothesized that the normal p53-regulated apoptotic response to DNA damage would be altered in ALL and that this alteration would influence drug response and treatment outcome. To test this, we first used global expression profiling in related human B-lineage lymphoblastoid cell lines with either wild type or mutant TP53 to characterize the normal p53-mediated transcriptional response to ionizing radiation (IR) and identified 747 p53-regulated apoptotic target genes. We then sorted these genes into six temporal expression clusters (TECs) based upon differences over time in their IR-induced p53-regulated gene expression patterns, and found that one cluster (TEC1) was associated with multidrug resistance in leukemic blasts in one cohort of children with ALL and was an independent predictor of survival in two others. Therefore, by investigating p53-mediated apoptosis in vitro, we identified a gene signature significantly associated with drug resistance and treatment outcome in ALL. These results suggest that intersecting pathway-derived and clinically derived expression data may be a powerful method to discover driver gene signatures with functional and clinical implications in pediatric ALL and perhaps other cancers as well.",,['NOTNLM'],"['gene expression signature', 'outcomes analysis', 'p53', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",PMC5602435,['R01 MH111099/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

Their diagnostic potential could largely benefit from a simultaneous screening of intrinsic biophysical properties at single-cell level. For such a purpose, we analyzed light scattering signatures of individual mononuclear blood cells in microfluidic flow. In particular, we extracted a set of biophysical properties including morphometric (dimension, shape and nucleus-to-cytosol ratio) and optical (optical density) ones to clearly discriminate different cell types and stages. By considering distinctive ranges of biophysical properties along with the obtained relative cell frequencies, we can identify unique cell classes corresponding to specific clinical conditions (p < 0.01). Based on such a straightforward approach, we are able to discriminate T-, B-lymphocytes, monocytes and beyond that first results on different stages of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells are presented. This work shows that the simultaneous screening of only three biophysical properties enables a clear distinction between pathological and physiological mononuclear blood stream cells.

The miR-148/152 family has been reported to be express differently in various kinds of tumors. We investigated the expression level of the miR-148/152 family in AML patients and their clinical significance. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression levels of the miR-148/152 family in 80 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 20 healthy participants were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the relationship between the expression levels of the miR-148/152 family and clinicopathological features of AML patients. RESULTS Compared with healthy controls, we found a significant lower expression of downregulated miR-148/152 in AML patients (p<0.0001). The expression of miR148/152 family was associated with various AML clinicopathological risk parameters including FAB classifications, cytogenetics, and gene mutations. The number of patients with high expression levels of miR-148a/b was significantly increased in the low-risk group and significantly decreased in the high-risk group. (p=0.025, p=0.000, respectively). Patients with higher expression of miR-148b showed a higher complete remission (CR) rate (p=0.043). Importantly, higher expression of miR-148a/b was correlated with lower relapse rate (p=0.035, p=0.027, respectively) and showed a longer relapse-free survival (RFS) (p=0.0321, p=0.002, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, RFS was significantly affected by the expression of miR-148a/b in patients the high and the intermediate-risk groups (p=0.0499, p=0.0114, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The expression levels of the miR-148/152 family were lower in patients with AML compared to healthy controls, and were associated with various AML clinicopathological parameters and therapeutic effect.

Moreover, recent large-scale sequencing studies have revealed the acquisition of clonal somatic mutations, in the myeloid neoplasm-associated genes of the hematopoietic cells. Such mutations were detected in people with normal blood cell counts, without any apparent disease. Presence of these mutations confers an increased risk for subsequent hematological neoplasms, indicating the concept of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

In recent years, the conditioning regimens have become less intensive, thus enabling the use of additional therapies post-transplantation. In this review, we have discussed the use of each targeted therapy, such as TKIs for Philadelphia chromosome positive disease, Flt3 inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and hypomethylating agents, in the context of using them with HSCT. Furthermore, we have discussed the importance of the intensity of chemotherapy and conditioning for HSCT and whether the depth of remission and the time of achieving deep remission are important. MRD tests can help to further delineate this point. Molecular targeted therapy will be more prevalent in the near future in the treatment of hematological malignancies where each new agent may impact the GVHD/GVL effect.

In proliferation centers, the survival and growth of CLL cells requires a permissive microenvironment comprising T-cells, macrophages, and stromal cells. FISH analysis has revealed that almost 80% of CLL cases carry chromosomal abnormalities including the most frequent del (13q14) and the strongest poor prognostic factor del (17p), both related to TP53 mutations. Current treatment approaches are not curative for CLL, except allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is rarely offered to the majority of patients aged 70 years and older. Currently, there is no evidence that the initiation of therapy for asymptomatic early-stage disease improves the overall survival, even for patients with high-risk disease. The identification that the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is aberrantly and constitutively activated in CLL has recently led to the development of BCR signaling inhibitors, ibrutinib and idelalisib. In addition, a novel BCL-2 antagonist, venetoclax, appears promising when used alone or in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies.

Recent analysis using next generation sequencing has provided great progress in identifying relationships between gene mutations and clinical phenotypes of MDS. It is estimated that one or more gene mutations occur in greater than 90% of MDS patients. More than 50 gene mutations affecting RNA splicing machinery, DNA methylation, histone modifications, transcription factors, signal transduction proteins, and components of the cohesion complex participate in the pathogenesis of MDS. The sequential accumulation of additional cooperating mutations drives disease evolution from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to symptomatic MDS and from MDS to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Mutations in RNA splicing and DNA methylation occur early and are considered founding mutations, whereas others that occur later are regarded as subclonal mutations. RUNX1 mutations are more likely to be subclonal; however, they apparently play a pivotal role in familial MDS. In addition, large alterations of chromosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. 5q- syndrome, which leads to haploinsufficiency of the located genes, has consistent clinical features.

Previous studies have revealed specific molecular machineries essential for LSCs. Targeting LSC-specific molecules should be a good therapeutic approach to kill LSCs without affecting normal cells. In this review, we would like to introduce the recent progress in the LSC study.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Leukemic stem cell', '*Target therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MDS, mutations of genes such as NRAS and FLT3, designated as Type-1 genes, may be significantly associated with leukemic evolution. Another type (Type-2) of genes, including RUNX1 and GATA2, are related to progression from low-risk to high-risk MDS.

Mechanistically, beta-catenin regulates expression of downstream targets of a key transcriptional memory gene, Hoxa9 that is highly enriched in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs and helps sustain leukemic self-renewal. Suppression of Hoxa9 sensitizes LSK-derived MLL-CSCs to beta-catenin inhibition resulting in abolishment of CSC transcriptional program and transformation ability. In addition, further molecular and functional analyses identified Prmt1 as a key common downstream mediator for beta-catenin/Hoxa9 functions in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs. Together, these findings not only uncover an unexpectedly important role of cells of origin transcriptional memory in regulating CSC self-renewal, but also reveal a novel molecular network mediated by beta-catenin/Hoxa9/Prmt1 in governing leukemic self-renewal.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Hoxa9', '*MLL leukemia', '*Prmt1', '*Wnt/beta-catenin', '*cells of origin']",PMC5666593,"['14018/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'A16753/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G0800892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_1102/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed at further understanding DAPK2 function and regulation during arsenic trioxide (ATO) cytotoxic or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) differentiation therapy in APL cells. We found that the p53 family member transactivation domain-p73 isoform (TAp73) binds to and activates the DAPK2 promoter, whereas the dominant-negative DeltaNp73 isoform inhibits DAPK2 transcription. Furthermore, the knocking down of tumor protein p73 (TP73) in NB4 cells resulted in reduced DAPK2 expression associated with decreased cell death and autophagy upon ATO and ATRA treatment, respectively. Moreover, the silencing of DAPK2 revealed that DAPK2 is an important downstream effector of p73 in ATO-induced apoptosis but not autophagy responses of APL cells. In contrast, the p73-DAPK2 pathway is essential for ATRA-induced autophagy that is mediated by an interaction of DAPK2 with the key autophagy-related protein (ATG)5. Lastly, we show that DAPK2 binds and stabilizes the p73 protein; thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which ATO- or ATRA-induced therapy responses initiate a positive p73-DAPK2 feedback loop.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*DRP-1', '*apoptosis', '*p73']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a mouse ischemic hind-limb model, CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) cells migrated to ischemic femoral muscles through CX3CL1-mediated chemotaxis. CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) macrophages isolated from ischemic tissues [tissue (T)-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) ] of muscle exert a proangiogenic effect through platelet factor-4 (CXCL4; PF-4) production. PF-4 does not promote angiogenesis by itself but, instead, increases VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Despite proangiogenic effects of muscle-derived T-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) macrophages, their clinical implementation is limited because muscle excision is required for cell harvesting. Therefore, we focused on the more accessible bone marrow (BM)-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) monocytes, which migrate from BM into ischemic muscles via CX3CL1-mediated chemotaxis. PF-4 expression was not detected in BM-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) monocytes under normal conditions, but CX3CL1 (50 ng/ml) induced high PF-4 expression and enabled BM-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) monocytes to achieve a similar angiogenic potential to that of T-CD11b(+) CX3CR1(+) macrophages ex vivo. Furthermore, we were able to identify a subset of monocytes that express CD11b and CX3CR1 in human peripheral blood and confirmed the proangiogenic effect of CX3CL1 treatment.

Epub 2017 Oct 4.,"A number of studies have recently demonstrated that super-enhancers, which are large cluster of enhancers typically marked by a high level of acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 and mediator bindings, are frequently associated with genes that control and define cell identity during normal development. Super-enhancers are also often enriched at cancer genes in various malignancies. The identification of such enhancers would pinpoint critical factors that directly contribute to pathogenesis. In this study, we performed enhancer profiling using primary leukemia samples from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which is a genetically heterogeneous intractable cancer. Super-enhancers were enriched at genes involved in the T-cell activation pathway, including IL2RA/CD25, CD30, and FYN, in both ATL and normal mature T cells, which reflected the origin of the leukemic cells. Super-enhancers were found at several known cancer gene loci, including CCR4, PIK3R1, and TP73, in multiple ATL samples, but not in normal mature T cells, which implicated those genes in ATL pathogenesis. A small-molecule CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, efficiently inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, and downregulated the expression of super-enhancer-associated genes in ATL cells. Furthermore, enhancer profiling combined with gene expression analysis identified a previously uncharacterized gene, TIAM2, that was associated with super-enhancers in all ATL samples, but not in normal T cells. Knockdown of TIAM2 induced apoptosis in ATL cell lines, whereas overexpression of this gene promoted cell growth. Our study provides a novel strategy for identifying critical cancer genes.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC5701524,['R01 CA179483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporating 4-1BB costimulation in CARs may enable T cells to resist this functional exhaustion; however, the potential ramifications of tonic 4-1BB signaling in CAR T cells remain unclear. Here, we found that tonic CAR-derived 4-1BB signaling can produce toxicity in T cells via continuous TRAF2-dependent activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and augmented FAS-dependent cell death. This mechanism was amplified in a non-self-inactivating gammaretroviral vector through positive feedback on the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, further enhancing CAR expression and tonic signaling. Attenuating CAR expression by substitution with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector minimized tonic signaling and improved T cell expansion and anti-tumor function. These studies illuminate the interaction between tonic CAR signaling and the chosen expression platform and identify inhibitory properties of the 4-1BB costimulatory domain that have direct implications for rational CAR design.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Here, we introduce quantitative deformability cytometry (q-DC), a method for rapid, calibrated, single-cell mechanotyping. We track changes in cell shape as cells deform into microfluidic constrictions, and we calibrate the mechanical stresses using gel beads. We observe that time-dependent strain follows power-law rheology, enabling single-cell measurements of apparent elastic modulus, Ea, and power-law exponent, beta. To validate our method, we mechanotype human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells and thereby confirm q-DC measurements of Ea = 0.53 +/- 0.04 kPa. We also demonstrate that q-DC is sensitive to pharmacological perturbations of the cytoskeleton as well as differences in the mechanotype of human breast cancer cell lines (Ea = 2.1 +/- 0.1 and 0.80 +/- 0.19 kPa for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells). To establish an operational framework for q-DC, we investigate the effects of applied stress and cell/pore-size ratio on mechanotype measurements. We show that Ea increases with applied stress, which is consistent with stress stiffening behavior of cells. We also find that Ea increases for larger cell/pore-size ratios, even when the same applied stress is maintained; these results indicate strain stiffening and/or dependence of mechanotype on deformation depth. Taken together, the calibrated measurements enabled by q-DC should advance applications of cell mechanotype in basic research and clinical settings.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Biophysical Society.

MYC and MCL1 are frequently co-amplified in drug-resistant TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Herein, we demonstrate that MYC and MCL1 cooperate in the maintenance of chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) in TNBC. MYC and MCL1 increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), processes involved in maintenance of CSCs. A mutant of MCL1 that cannot localize in mitochondria reduced mtOXPHOS, ROS levels, and drug-resistant CSCs without affecting the anti-apoptotic function of MCL1. Increased levels of ROS, a by-product of activated mtOXPHOS, led to the accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1alpha attenuated CSC enrichment and tumor initiation in vivo. These data suggest that (1) MYC and MCL1 confer resistance to chemotherapy by expanding CSCs via mtOXPHOS and (2) targeting mitochondrial respiration and HIF-1alpha may reverse chemotherapy resistance in TNBC.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

METHODS: The MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide), flow cytometry, qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and western blot assay were used for cells growth inhibitory effects, cells apoptosis (DNA content of sub-G1), mRNA and protein expressions, respectively. RESULTS: The 10 mug/mL of Res had no growth inhibitory effect on Nthy-ori 3-1 normal cells or HepG2 cancer cells meanwhile the 5 or 10 mug/mL of PA also had no growth inhibitory effect on Nthy-ori 3-1 normal cells. Where as PA-L (5 mug/mL) and PA-H (10 mug/mL) had the growth inhibitory effects in HepG2 cancer cells, and Res increase these growth inhibitory effects. By flow cytometry experiment, after Res (5 mug/mL) + PA-H (10 mug/mL) treatment, the HepG2 cells showed the most apoptosis in cells as compared to other treatments groups, and after additionally treated with Res, both the apoptosis cells of two concentrations PA were raised. As PA raised it also raised the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bax (Bcl-2 assaciated X protein), p53, p21, IkappaB-alpha (inhibitor of NF-kappaB alpha), Fas (factor associated suicide), FasL (factor associated suicide ligand), TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1), TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2) and decrease Bcl-2 (B cell leukemia 2), Bcl-xL (B cell leukemia extra large), HIAP-1 (cIAP-1, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1), HIAP-2 (cIAP-2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2), NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa B), COX-2 (cyclooxygenase 2), iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), MMP-2 (metalloproteinase 2), MMP-9 (metalloproteinase 9), EGF (epidermal growth factor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), Fit-1 (VEGFR-1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1). Meanwhile, the 5 mug/mL of Res could enhance these mRNA expressions changes as compared to the control cells. CONCLUSION: From these results, we can conclude that Res could raise the anticancer effects of PA in HepG2 cells, Res could be used as a good sensitizing agent for PA.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'HepG2 human liver cancer cells', 'Paclitaxel', 'Resveratrol', 'Sensitizing']",PMC5628430,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, identification ofsafe and effective multidrug resistance-reversing compounds with minimal side effects is an important approach in cancer treatment. Here, we investigated the role and potential mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia (K562/DOX) cells. The effect of doxorubicin on cell viability following treatment with balaglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, was evaluated using trypan blue and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Rhodamine123 assay was used to determine the activity of two common drug efflux membrane transporters P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein-1. P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein-1, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 messenger RNA/protein expression levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate assay was also employed to investigate apoptosis. We showed that balaglitazone considerably enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. Balaglitazone also significantly downregulated P-glycoprotein expression and activity in K562/DOX cells and reduced multidrug resistance through elevation of intracellular doxorubicin in cells. Furthermore, upon balaglitazone treatment, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 expression could be restored in K562/DOX cells in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-dependent manner. We concluded that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, balaglitazone, could reverse multidrug resistance by inducing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/ phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma might serve as an effective approach for circumventing multidrug resistance in chemotherapy of cancerous patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor', 'multidrug resistance protein-1', 'phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 5.,"INTRODUCTION: Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is becoming an increasingly successful and widespread form of treatment for different types of cancer. Compared to chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies, ACT is an active biological strategy, with infused immune cells featuring dynamic migration, expansion and long-term persistence properties. ACT in hematological malignancies offered the initial proof of principle of the feasibility for this innovative 'live-drug'. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors summarize the clinical results achieved with two specific strategies in hematological malignancies: chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (transgenic TCR) redirected T cells. Moreover, they discuss the recent pre-clinical studies aimed at increasing the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ACT. EXPERT OPINION: ACT can promote cancer regression in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, more precise targeting of tumor cells and containment of side effects are needed. Overcoming tumor-associated immunosuppressive mechanisms and preventing tumor escape are also emerging as critical barriers.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of imatinib therapy in 10 adult SM patients lacking exon 17 KIT mutations, 9 of which fulfilled criteria for well-differentiated SM (WDSM). The World Health Organization 2008 disease categories among WDSM patients were mast cell (MC) leukemia (n = 3), indolent SM (n = 3) and cutaneous mastocytosis (n = 3); the remainder case had SM associated with a clonal haematological non-MC disease. Patients were given imatinib for 12 months -400 or 300 mg daily depending on the presence vs. absence of > 30% bone marrow (BM) MCs and/or signs of advanced disease-. Absence of exon 17 KIT mutations was confirmed in highly-purified BM MCs by peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR, while mutations involving other exons were investigated by direct sequencing of purified BM MC DNA. Complete response (CR) was defined as resolution of BM MC infiltration, skin lesions, organomegalies and MC-mediator release-associated symptoms, plus normalization of serum tryptase. Criteria for partial response (PR) included >/= 50% reduction in BM MC infiltration and improvement of skin lesions and/or organomegalies. Treatment was well-tolerated with an overall response rate of 50%, including early and sustained CR in four patients, three of whom had extracellular mutations of KIT, and PR in one case. This later patient and all non-responders (n = 5) showed wild-type KIT. These results together with previous data from the literature support the relevance of the KIT mutational status in selecting SM patients who are candidates for imatinib therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['KIT', 'imatinib', 'mast cell', 'mastocytosis', 'well-differentiated systemic mastocytosis']",PMC5620310,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that kinase inhibitors targeting oncogenic B-RAF can also affect Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP)1 and RIP3. Sorafenib, a multi-targeting kinase inhibitor with activity against B-RAF, is used for the treatment of acute leukemia. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether Sorafenib interferes with therapeutic induction of necroptosis in acute leukemia. Here, we report that Sorafenib inhibits necroptotic signaling and cell death in two models of necroptosis in acute leukemia. Sorafenib significantly reduces Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) mimetic-induced necroptosis in apoptosis-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells as well as Smac mimetic/Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)alpha-induced necroptosis in FADD-deficient acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Sub- to low micromolar concentrations of Sorafenib corresponding to its plasma levels reported in cancer patients are sufficient to inhibit necroptosis, emphasizing the clinical relevance of our findings. Furthermore, Sorafenib blocks Smac mimetic-mediated phosphorylation of mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) that marks its activation, indicating that Sorafenib targets components upstream of MLKL such as RIP1 and RIP3. Intriguingly, Sorafenib reduces the Smac mimetic/TNFalpha-stimulated interaction of RIP1 with RIP3 and MLKL, demonstrating that it interferes with the assembly of the necrosome complex. Importantly, Sorafenib significantly protects primary, patient-derived AML blasts from Smac mimetic-induced necroptosis. By demonstrating that Sorafenib limits the anti-leukemic activity of necroptosis-inducing drugs in acute leukemia cells, our study has important implications for the use of Sorafenib in the treatment of acute leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Smac', 'Sorafenib', 'cell death', 'leukemia', 'necroptosis']",PMC5620249,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,

The PKM1/M2 shift is controlled by the alternative splicing of two mutually exclusive exons in the PKM gene. PKM1 is expressed in differentiated tissues, whereas PKM2 is expressed in cancer tissues. This study revealed that the haplodeficiency of FUSE-binding protein (FBP)-interacting repressor (FIR), a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene, contributed to the splicing of PKM1 to PKM2 in mice thymic lymphoma and/or T-cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using six-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis. TMT revealed 648 proteins that were up- or downregulated in mice thymic lymphoma tissues compared with wild type mouse. These proteins included transcription factors and proteins involved in DNA damage repair, DNA replication, T-cell activation/proliferation, apoptosis, etc. Among them, PKM2 protein, but not PKM1, was upregulated in the thymic lymphoma as well as T-ALL. Using qRT-PCR, we revealed that the activation of PKM2 mRNA was higher in thymic lymphoma cells of FIR(+/-)TP53(-/-) mice than that in control lymphocytes of FIR(+/+)TP53(-/-) sorted by flow cytometry. FIR knockdown by siRNA suppressed hnRNPA1 expression in HeLa cells. These results indicated that FIR haplodeficiency contributes the alternative splicing of PKM1 to PKM2 by partly inhibiting hnRNPA1 expression in the thymic lymphoma cells prior to T-ALL. Taken together, our findings suggest that FIR and its related spliceosomes are potential therapeutic targets for cancers, including T-ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['FUSE-binding protein-interacting repressor', 'LC-MS/MS', 'pyruvate kinase M2', 'six-plex tandem mass tags labeling', 'thymic lymphoma']",PMC5620227,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST We have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,

Direct targeting of the SHH pathway with SANT-1, following Vorinostat induced epi-sensitisation, resulted in synergistic cell death of AML cells.

Despite improved therapy only a subset of patients can be cured. Therefore, current research is focusing on new drug-targets. Members of the BCL-2 family and components of the PI3-kinase/mTOR pathway are critically involved in the regulation of growth and survival of ALL cells. We examined the effects of the pan-BCL-2 blocker obatoclax and the PI3-kinase/mTOR-inhibitor BEZ235 on growth and survival of ALL cells. In (3)H-thymidine uptake experiments, both drugs suppressed the in vitro proliferation of leukemic cells in all patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) ALL and Ph(-) ALL (obatoclax IC50: 0.01-5 muM; BEZ235, IC50: 0.01-1 muM). Both drugs were also found to produce growth-inhibitory effects in all Ph(+) and all Ph(-) cell lines tested. Moreover, obatoclax and BEZ235 induced apoptosis in ALL cells. In drug-combination experiments, obatoclax and BEZ235 exerted synergistic growth-inhibitory effects on ALL cells. Finally, we confirmed that ALL cells, including CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cells and all cell lines express transcripts for PI3-kinase, mTOR, BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-xL.

Elevated levels of NADPH, a central metabolic factor involved in redox reactions, are common in myeloid leukemia cells, but the significance or biochemical basis underlying this increase is unknown. Using a small molecule analog that efficiently inhibits NADPH-producing enzymes, we found that AML cells require NADPH homeostasis for cell growth. We also found that inhibiting NADPH production through knockdown of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) within the pentose phosphate pathway was sufficient to reduce cell growth and lactate production, a measure of metabolic reprogramming. Further, inhibition of 6PGD activity reduced NADH levels and enzymatic activity of the oxidized NADH-dependent sirtuin-1. Targeting 6PGD and NADPH production was sufficient to block growth of AML cell lines resistant to the chemotherapeutics daunorubicin and cytarabine. Importantly, stromal cell-mediated resistance to targeted inhibition of oncogenic FLT3 kinase activity by quizartinib was circumvented by 6PGD knockdown. Overall, these data suggest that the dependency of AML cells on NADPH to permit increased glycolytic flux creates a potential vulnerability of possible therapeutic benefit, since much of the enhanced production of NADPH is dependent on the activity of a single enzyme, 6PGD.",,['NOTNLM'],"['6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD)', 'FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'cancer metabolism', 'drug resistance']",PMC5620199,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No conflicts of interest are reported for this study.'],,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it is upregulated in malignant disease and has been described as an important factor for cancer prognosis and therapy. Under physiological conditions HO-1 is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Under stress conditions HO-1 can be cleaved and subsequently translocates to the cytosol and nucleus. In this study we systematically investigated the influence of HO-1's catabolic activity and subcellular localization on resistance against the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in leukemia cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy, hemoglobin synthesis experiments and cell viability assays. We created two types of monoclonal K562 cell lines stably transfected with GFP-tagged HO-1: cell lines expressing ER anchored HO-1 or anchorless HO-1. Since translocation of HO-1 disrupts the association with cytochrome P450 reductase, heme degrading activity was higher for ER anchored versus anchorless HO-1. Cell viability tests with increasing concentrations of imatinib showed IC50-values for all six cell lines with ER localized HO-1 that were similar to control cells. However, out of the seven cell lines with anchorless HO-1, two showed a statistically significant increase in the imatinib IC50 (19.76 muM and 12.35 muM versus 2.35 - 7.57 muM of sensitive cell lines) corresponding to plasma concentrations outside the therapeutic range. We conclude that the presence of translocated HO-1 in the cytosol and nucleus supports imatinib resistance while it is not sufficient to cause imatinib resistance in every cell line. In contrast, an increase in ER anchored HO-1 with high heme degrading activity does not contribute to imatinib resistance.",,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'heme oxygenase-1', 'imatinib', 'nuclear translocation']",PMC5620182,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest', 'with the contents of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,

We found PLC-gamma1 as one of the highest phosphorylated peptides in t(8;21) AML samples compared to NBM or CN-AML in our previous peptide microarray. PLC-gamma1 is known to play a role in cancer progression, however, the impact of PLC-gamma1 in AML is currently unknown. Therefore, we aimed to study the functional role of PLC-gamma1 by investigating the cellular growth, survival and its underlying mechanism in t(8;21) AML. In this study, PLC-gamma1 expression was significantly higher in t(8;21) AML compared to other karyotypes. The PLC-gamma1 protein expression was suppressed in AML1-ETO knock down cells indicating that it might induce kasumi-1 cell death. ShRNA-mediated PLC-gamma1 knockdown in kasumi-1 cells significantly blocked cell growth, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest which was explained by the increased activation of apoptotic related and cell cycle regulatory protein expressions. Gene expression array analysis showed the up-regulation of apoptotic and DNA damage response genes together with the downregulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation genes in the PLC-gamma1 suppressed kasumi-1 cells, consistent with the observed phenotypic effects. Importantly, PLC-gamma1 suppressed kasumi-1 cells showed higher chemosensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug treatments and lower cell proliferation upon hypoxic stress. Taken together, these in vitro finding strongly support an important role for PLC-gamma1 in the survival of t(8;21) AML mimicking kasumi-1 cells and identify PLC-gamma1 as a potential therapeutic target for t(8;21) AML treatment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PLC-gamma1', 'leukemia', 'peptide microarray', 't(8;21)']",PMC5620177,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, elevated expression levels of MSX1 persist in mature natural killer (NK)-cells, indicating a functional role in this compartment. While T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) subsets exhibit aberrant overexpression of MSX1, we show here that in malignant NK-cells the level of MSX1 transcripts is aberrantly downregulated. Chromosomal deletions at 4p16 hosting the MSX1 locus have been described in NK-cell leukemia patients. However, NK-cell lines analyzed here showed normal MSX1 gene configurations, indicating that this aberration might be uncommon. To identify alternative MSX1 regulatory mechanisms we compared expression profiling data of primary normal NK-cells and malignant NK-cell lines. This procedure revealed several deregulated genes including overexpressed IRF4, MIR155HG and MIR17HG and downregulated AUTS2, EP300, GATA3 and HHEX. As shown recently, chromatin-modulator AUTS2 is overexpressed in T-ALL subsets where it mediates aberrant transcriptional activation of MSX1. Here, our data demonstrate that in malignant NK-cell lines AUTS2 performed MSX1 activation as well, but in accordance with downregulated MSX1 transcription therein we detected reduced AUTS2 expression, a small genomic deletion at 7q11 removing exons 3 and 4, and truncating mutations in exon 1. Moreover, genomic profiling and chromosomal analyses of NK-cell lines demonstrated amplification of IRF4 at 6p25 and deletion of PRDM1 at 6q21, highlighting their potential oncogenic impact. Functional analyses performed via knockdown or forced expression of these genes revealed regulatory network disturbances effecting downregulation of MSX1 which may underlie malignant development in NK-cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['NKL-code', 'T-ALL', 'homeobox']",PMC5620138,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare they have no known conflicts of', 'interest in this work.']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program to identify 50,825 patients who had their clinical and follow-up information available and were diagnosed for AML between the years 1988 and 2015. The univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze the patient data, and to minimize the group differences due to covariates between groups, a 1:1 propensity score matching was used in subsequent subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that married patients were less likely to die due to AML after adjusting for demographic and clinicopathological variables, than patients with variable unmarried status. Further analysis indicated that widowed, divorced and never married status correlated with poor cancer-cause specific survival than being married in almost all subgroups after being adjusted for the aforementioned variables (P<0.05). However, the difference between married and separated was not apparent. Moreover, similar survival analysis results were also observed in the 1:1 matched subgroups of marital status, but they displayed varied prognostic factors between them. The association of survival benefit with marriage in AML was consistent with the published survival benefit of conventional therapeutic approaches. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study concluded that unmarried AML patients were at greater risk of cancer-specific mortality than married, and thus indicated that physicians should focus on health care strategies that target social support, in order to reduce the cancer-specific mortality in unmarried patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['SEER', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'marital status', 'subgroup analysis', 'survival analysis']",PMC5617539,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Considering the heterogeneity of the disease and the several immunophenotypes that LGL clone may express, the aim of this work was to evaluate whether STAT3 mutations might be associated with a distinctive LGL immunophenotype and/or might be indicative for specific clinical features. Our series of cases included a pilot cohort of 101 T-LGL leukemia patients (68 CD8+/CD4- and 33 CD4+/CD8+/-) from Padua Hematology Unit (Italy) and a validation cohort of additional 20 patients from Rennes Hematology Unit (France). Our results indicate that i) CD8+ T-LGL leukemia patients with CD16+/CD56- immunophenotype identify a subset of patients characterized by the presence of STAT3 mutations and neutropenia, ii) CD4+/CD8+/- T-LGL leukemia are devoid of STAT3 mutations but characterized by STAT5b mutations, and iii) a correlation exists between STAT3 activation and presence of Fas ligand, this molecule resulting highly expressed in CD8+/CD16+/CD56- patients. Experiments with stimulation and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation confirmed this relationship. In conclusion, our data show that T-LGL leukemia with specific molecular and phenotypic patterns is associated with discrete clinical features contributing to get insights into molecular bases accounting for the development of Fas ligand-mediated neutropenia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3 mutation', 'fas ligand', 'immunophenotype', 'large granular lymphocyte leukemia', 'neutropenia']",PMC5617471,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Most human cancers overexpress CD47, and antibodies to CD47 have shown a remarkable ability to clear a range of cancers in animal models. However, the mechanism by which these antibodies cause cancer cell death is unclear. We find that CD47 is expressed on the surface of three B-cell lines from human malignancies: 697 (pre-B-ALL lymphoblasts), Ramos and DG-75 (both mature B-cells, Burkitt's lymphoma), and anti-CD47 antibodies greatly increase the phagocytosis of all three cell line by macrophages. In the presence of macrophages, the antibodies cause clearance of the lymphoblasts within hours, but in the absence of macrophages, the antibodies have no effect on lymphoblast viability. Macrophages engulf viable lymphoblasts containing mitochondria with a normal membrane potential, but following engulfment the mitochondrial membrane potential is lost indicating a loss of viability. Inhibition of phagocytosis protects lymphoblasts from death indicating that phagocytosis is required for anti-CD47 mediated cell death. Blocking either the antibody Fc domain or Fc receptors inhibits antibody-induced phagocytosis. Antibodies against cell surface markers CD10 or CD19 also induced Fc-domain-dependent phagocytosis, but at a lower level commensurate with expression. Thus, phagoptosis may contribute to the efficacy of a number of therapeutic antibodies used in cancer therapy, as well as potentially endogenous antibodies. We conclude that anti-CD47 antibodies induce phagocytosis by binding CD47 on lymphoblast and Fc receptors on macrophages, resulting in cell death by phagocytosis, i.e. phagoptosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'antibodies', 'cell death', 'leukemia', 'phagocytosis', 'phagoptosis']",PMC5617392,['MR/L010593/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that there are no competing financial', 'interests in relation to the work described.']",,,,,,,,,,

To date, ALT1 biological roles in human vascular endothelial cells have not been reported. METHODS: ALT1 was knocked down by siRNAs. Cell proliferation was analyzed by cck-8. The existence and sequence of human ALT1 were identified by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The interaction between lncRNA and proteins was analyzed by RNA-Protein pull down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: ALT1 was expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of ALT1 was significantly downregulated in contact-inhibited HUVECs and in hypoxia-induced, growth-arrested HUVECs. Knocking down of ALT1 inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. We observed that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) was a direct target gene of ALT1. Knocking-down of ALT1 or its target gene ACE2 could efficiently decrease the expression of cyclin D1 via the enhanced ubiquitination and degradation, in which HIF-1alpha and protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) might be involved. CONCLUSION: The results suggested the human long non-coding RNA ALT1 is a novel regulator for cell cycle of HUVECs via ACE2 and cyclin D1 pathway.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

In this study, we found that the treatment of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with the innate immunity protein Tag7 (PGRP-S, PGLYRP1) induces differentiation of the populations of NK (natural killer) cells and CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes that are cytotoxic for human leukocyte antigen-negative tumor cells. These populations employ different mechanisms of tumor cell lysis (based on the release of granzymes in the case of NK cells and on the FasL-Fas interaction in the case of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes) and induce different death pathways (apoptosis or necroptosis) in tumor cells. An analysis of genes activated in leukocyte populations after Tag7 treatment and experiments with specific inhibitors have shown that the TREM-1 receptor expressed on the monocyte cell surface is essential for activation of cytotoxic activity. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence for a novel role of the Tag7 protein in the immune response.","['(c) 2017 S.

The clinical manifestations of radiation nephropathy occur months after exposure. To date, there are no known early biomarkers to predict the future development of radiation nephropathy. This study focuses on the development of urinary biomarkers providing readout of acute responses in renal tubular epithelial cells. An amplification-free hybridization-based nCounter assay was used to detect changes in mouse urinary miRNAs after irradiation. After a single LD50 of total-body irradiation (TBI) or clinically relevant fractionated doses (2 Gy twice daily for 3 days), changes in urinary levels of microRNAs followed either an early pattern, peaking at 6-8 h postirradiation and gradually declining, or later pattern, peaking from 24 h to 7 days. Of 600 miRNAs compared, 12 urinary miRNAs showed the acute response and seven showed the late response, common to both irradiation protocols. miR-1224 and miR-21 were of particular interest, since they were the most robust acute and late responders, respectively. The early responding miR-1224 also exhibited good dose response after 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy TBI, indicating its potential use as a biomarker for radiation exposure. In situ hybridization of irradiated mouse kidney sections and cultured mouse primary renal tubular cells confirmed the tubular origin of miR-1224. A significant upregulation in hsa-miR-1224-3p expression was also observed in human proximal renal tubular cells after irradiation. Consistent with mouse urine data, a similar expression pattern of hsa-miR-1224-3p and hsa-miR-21 were observed in urine samples collected from human leukemia patients preconditioned with TBI.

Epub 2017 Nov 6.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) as treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) relies on immune-mediated graft-versus-leukaemia effects. Previous studies have suggested a strong association between graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurrence and graft-versus-leukaemia effects after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. METHODS: Here, we evaluated the kinetics of relapse rate in correlation with GVHD occurrence after UCBT. The kinetics of relapse rate over time in correlation to GVHD occurrence were assessed by calculating the relapse rate per patient-year within sequential 90-day intervals. The impact of GVHD on relapse and mortality was further studied in multivariate Cox models handling GVHD as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: The study included data from 1068 patients given single (n = 567) or double (n = 501) UCBT. The proportion of patients with grade II, III and IV acute GVHD was 20%, 7% and 4%, respectively. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 42%, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 32%, and overall survival was 32% as well. Relapse rates declined gradually over time during the first 30 months after transplantation. There was a possible suggestion that grade II-IV acute (HR = 0.8, P = 0.1) and chronic (HR = 0.65, P = 0.1) GVHD decreased relapse risk. However, grade II-IV acute GVHD significantly increased early (the first 18 months after UCBT) mortality (HR = 1.3, P = 0.02), whilst chronic GVHD increased each early (HR = 2.7, P < 0.001) and late (HR = 4.9, P < 0.001) mortality after UCBT. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of grade II-IV acute or chronic GVHD each increases overall mortality after UCBT for AML mitigating the possible graft-versus-leukemia effect of GVHD.",['(c) 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukaemia effects', '*umbilical cord blood transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 101 patients was performed. BMD and body composition were evaluated using bone densitometry and were interpreted according to the age group and the reference population. Values between -1.1 and -1.9 in the group of children under 20 years were considered as risk group for low BMD z-scores. BMD values were compared to clinical characteristics, treatment received and body composition. A chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, likelihood ratio and Student's t-test were applied, with a 5% significance level. RESULTS: The patients presented a frequency of fractures of 2%, of osteonecrosis, 2%, and of low BMD, 2.9%. In the group of 79 patients under 20 years of age, three had low BMD. The 16 that presented risk for low BMD, demonstrated lower valutes in lumbar vertebrae L1-L4 (p=0.01) and whole body (p=0.005), and smaller values of lean body mass (p=0.03). In the group of 22 patients over 20 years of age, ten had osteopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The low impact of treatment on BMD of this study confirms the concept that the bone mass gain occurs with increasing age and that the treatment does not influence the process. The population at risk for low BMD values presented lower bone mass values and could benefit from a long-term monitoring for possible bone toxicity.",,,,PMC5417798,,,,,,AVALIACAO DOS EFEITOS OSSEOS TARDIOS E COMPOSICAO CORPORAL DE CRIANCAS E ADOLESCENTES TRATADOS DE LEUCEMIA LINFOIDE AGUDA SEGUNDO PROTOCOLOS BRASILEIROS.,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Nov 23.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a clonal hematologic malignancy that results in bone marrow failure, is the most common acute leukemia in adults (median age of diagnosis 67 yrs), and treatment options, especially in the elderly population, are limited. Induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3, the combination of continuous-infusion cytarabine and intermittent dosing of an anthracycline administered over 7 and 3 days, respectively, has remained the standard of care since its introduction in 1973 in the United States. Midostaurin is a first-generation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor (TKI) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2017 for the treatment of FLT3-mutant AML. We performed a search of the PubMed database (January 1990-January 2017) to review pertinent clinical trials of midostaurin. Phase I, II, and III trials reported in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of midostaurin in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome were included. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was also searched for ongoing trials. In the only phase III trial that has been conducted to date, midostaurin demonstrated significant improvement compared with placebo in overall and event-free survival in patients aged 18-59 years with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML treated with standard induction chemotherapy. The median overall survival for patients randomized to the midostaurin group was 74.7 months versus 25.6 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.96, p=0.009). Median event-free survival was 8.2 months with midostaurin compared with 3.0 months with placebo (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93, p=0.002). In addition to being evaluated in combination with conventional chemotherapy, midostaurin has been studied as monotherapy, in combination with the hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine, and as single-agent maintenance. Studies evaluating midostaurin in the maintenance setting after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are underway. Midostaurin is the first oral multitargeted TKI to improve overall survival in patients with FLT3-mutant AML and represents an important addition to the limited armamentarium against AML.","['(c) 2017 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3-mutant AML', '*PKC412', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*midostaurin', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 4.,"BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve the survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) dramatically; however, nonadherence to TKI therapy may lead to resistance to the therapy. TKIs are very expensive and are covered under Part D insurance for Medicare patients. To the authors' knowledge, the impact of low-income subsidy status and cost sharing on adherence among this group has not been well studied in the literature. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data linked with Medicare Part D data from the years 2007 through 2012 were used in the current study. The authors identified 836 patients with CML with Medicare Part D insurance coverage who were new TKI users. Treatment nonadherence was defined as a binary variable indicating the percentage of days covered was <80% during the 180-day period after the initiation of TKI therapy. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between out-of-pocket costs per 30-day drug supply, Medicare Part D plan characteristics, and treatment adherence while controlling for other patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 244 of the 836 patients with CML (29%) were nonadherent to targeted oral therapy during the 180 days after the initiation of treatment with TKIs. The multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that patients with heavily subsidized (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-15.9) and moderately subsidized (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.5) Medicare Part D plans were much more likely to demonstrate nonadherence compared with patients without a subsidy. CONCLUSIONS: The current population-based study found a significantly higher rate of nonadherence among heavily subsidized patients with substantially lower out-of-pocket costs, which suggests that future research is needed to help lower the nonadherence rate among these individuals.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of a purified white grape pomace extract (PWGPE) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells and to characterize the underlying mechanism. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by flow cytometry and protein expression levels were analysed by Western blotting. PWGPE induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The anticancer effect was associated with an increased expression of p73 and down-regulation of pro-survival factors, including p-Akt, Bcl-2, and survivin. PWGPE reduced the expression of several proteins that block the expression of apoptosis-related genes such as DNMT1, HDAC1/2, UHRF1, and the polycomb group protein members: EZH2, SUZ12, and BMI1. In addition, the extract induced the formation of ROS, whereas pre-treatment with PEG-catalase and N-acetylcysteine prevented the ROS formation and markedly decreased the induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that PWGPE-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells, is mediated by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 cleavage, and depends on ROS generation and regulation of epigenetic gene silencing. Therefore, PWGPE may play an important role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that expression of JMML-initiating PTPN11 mutations in HSC-independent yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors (YS EMPs) would result in a mouse model of pediatric myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). RESULTS: E9.5 YS EMPs from VavCre+;PTPN11(D61Y) embryos demonstrated growth hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling. Mutant EMPs engrafted the spleens of neonatal recipients, but did not cause disease. To assess MPN development during unperturbed hematopoiesis we generated CSF1R-MCM+;PTPN11(E76K) ;ROSA(YFP) mice in which oncogene expression was restricted to EMPs. Yellow fluorescent protein-positive progeny of mutant EMPs persisted in tissues one year after birth and demonstrated hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling. Nevertheless, these mice had normal survival and did not demonstrate features of MPN. CONCLUSIONS: YS EMPs expressing mutant PTPN11 demonstrate functional and molecular features of JMML but do not cause disease following transplantation nor following unperturbed development.

Epub 2017 Oct 16.,"The antitumor effectiveness of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and other chemotherapeutics was shown to rely not only on direct cytotoxicity but also on immunogenic tumor cell death and systemic immunomodulatory mechanisms, including regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion, Th1 cell polarization, type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine production. IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is a transcriptional regulator of IFNs and IFN-inducible genes, involved in the control of Th1 and Treg differentiation and in sterile inflammation. Aim of this study was to explore the role of IRF-1 in CTX-induced antitumor effects and related immune activities. This study shows for the first time that IRF-1 is important for the antitumor efficacy of CTX in mice. Moreover, experiments in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice showed that Irf1 gene expression in the spleen was transiently increased following CTX administration and correlated with the induction of Th1 cell expansion and of Il12p40 gene expression, which is the main Th1-driving cytokine. At the same time, CTX administration reduced both Foxp3 expression and Treg cell percentages. These effects were abrogated in Irf1(-/-) mice. Further experiments showed that the gene and/or protein expression of caspase-1, iNOS, IL-1beta, IL-6 and CXCL10 and the levels of nitric oxide were modulated following CTX in an IRF-1-direct- or -indirect-dependent manner, and highlighted the importance of caspase-1 in driving the sterile inflammatory response to CTX. Our data identify IRF-1 as important for the antitumor efficacy of CTX and for the regulation of many immunomodulatory activities of CTX, such as Th1 polarization, Treg depletion and inflammation.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*IRF-1', '*alkylating agents', '*cyclophosphamide', '*cytokines', '*immune responses to anticancer drugs', '*immunomodulation', '*regulatory T cell depletion', '*sterile inflammation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been very few studies comparing infections during induction and consolidation. We have analyzed blood cultures of patients with AML during episodes of fever occurring during induction and consolidation, for comparing the bloodstream infections in both the phases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood cultures of patients during febrile episodes were collected from central venous catheters and peripheral blood, both during induction and consolidation therapy of AML. RESULTS: The study population included 52 AML patients. During induction, there were 52 episodes of fever and 25 (48%) blood cultures were positive, 15 of these blood cultures reported Gram-negative organisms, 9 reported Gram-positive organisms and 1 as yeast. During consolidation, 47 episodes of fever were recorded and blood cultures were positive in 12, of which 7 were Gram-negative, 5 were Gram-positive. CONCLUSION: The incidence of blood culture positive infections during therapy of AML at our center was higher. The predominant organism isolated was Gram-negative both during induction and consolidation. The incidence of blood culture positive infections had decreased by 50% during consolidation.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'consolidation', 'induction']",PMC5615885,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

The biguanide metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) have been reported to inhibit proliferation of solid tumors and hematological malignancies, but their role in differentiation is less explored. Our previous study demonstrated that AICAR alone induced AMPK-independent expression of differentiation markers in monocytic U937 leukemia cells, and no such effects were observed in response to metformin. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of AICAR-mediated effects and to test for the possible role of autophagy in differentiation of leukemia cells. The results showed that AICAR-mediated effects on the expression of differentiation markers were not mimicked by A769662, a more specific direct AMPK activator. Long-term incubation of U937 cells with AICAR and other differentiation agents, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, increased the expression of the autophagy marker LC3B-II, and these effects were not observed in response to metformin. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses of U937 cells treated with bafilomycin A1 or transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3 proved that the increase in the expression of LC3B-II was due to an increase in autophagy flux, and not to a decrease in lysosomal degradation. 3-Methyladenine inhibited the expression of differentiation markers in response to all inducers, but had stimulatory effects on autophagy flux at dose that effectively inhibited the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. The small inhibitory RNA-mediated down-modulation of Beclin 1 and hVPS34 had no effects on AICAR and ATRA-mediated increase in the expression of differentiation markers. These results show that AICAR and other differentiation agents induce autophagy flux in U937 cells and that the effects of AICAR and ATRA on the expression of differentiation markers do not depend on the normal levels of key proteins of the classical or canonical autophagy pathway.",,,,PMC5624282,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Transformation into Richter disease and occurrence of second malignancies involving the lungs are rare complications. The hallmarks of any thoracic involvement are still unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 56-year-old male patient, with history of tobacco smoking, who presented with recurrent hemoptysis, fatigue and weight loss. Physical examination was normal except a slightly enlarged supraclavicular lymph node. Chest x-ray revealed a mediastinal widening due to enlarged paratracheal nodes and a left parahilar infiltrate. Blood tests showed a hyperlymphocytosis and a biological inflammatory syndrome. CT scan showed bilateral mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy, as well as left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, with a left upper lobe alveolar attenuation and a solitary contralateral pulmonary nodule. Examination of Virchow's node and bone marrow biopsies confirmed metastasis of a pulmonary adenocarcinoma, as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia with Richter's transformation. The clinical course was unfavorable since the first days of therapy as the patient passed away in a matter of a few days.

A chimeric fusion between the RNA binding protein EWS and the ETS family transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1), which is generated from a chromosomal translocation, is implicated in driving most ES cases by modulation of transcription and alternative splicing. The small-molecule YK-4-279 inhibits EWS-FLI1 function and induces apoptosis in ES cells. We aimed to identify both the underlying mechanism of the drug and potential combination therapies that might enhance its antitumor activity. We tested 69 anticancer drugs in combination with YK-4-279 and found that vinca alkaloids exhibited synergy with YK-4-279 in five ES cell lines. The combination of YK-4-279 and vincristine reduced tumor burden and increased survival in mice bearing ES xenografts. We determined that independent drug-induced events converged to cause this synergistic therapeutic effect. YK-4-279 rapidly induced G2-M arrest, increased the abundance of cyclin B1, and decreased EWS-FLI1-mediated generation of microtubule-associated proteins, which rendered cells more susceptible to microtubule depolymerization by vincristine. YK-4-279 reduced the expression of the EWS-FLI1 target gene encoding the ubiquitin ligase UBE2C, which, in part, contributed to the increase in cyclin B1. YK-4-279 also increased the abundance of proapoptotic isoforms of MCL1 and BCL2, presumably through inhibition of alternative splicing by EWS-FLI1, thus promoting cell death in response to vincristine. Thus, a combination of vincristine and YK-4-279 might be therapeutically effective in ES patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"Purpose: BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL leukemic cells are highly dependent on the expression of endogenous antiapoptotic MCL-1 to promote viability and are resistant to BH3-mimetic agents such as navitoclax (ABT-263) that target BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W. However, the survival of most normal blood cells and other cell types is also dependent on Mcl-1 Despite the requirement for MCL-1 in these cell types, initial reports of MCL-1-specific BH3-mimetics have not described any overt toxicities associated with single-agent use, but these agents are still early in clinical development. Therefore, we sought to identify approved drugs that could sensitize leukemic cells to ABT-263.Experimental Design: A screen identified dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a water-soluble metabolite of the antimalarial artemisinin. Using mouse and human leukemic cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts, the effect of DHA on survival was tested, and mechanistic studies were carried out to discover how DHA functions. We further tested in vitro and in vivo whether combining DHA with ABT-263 could enhance the response of leukemic cells to combination therapy.Results: DHA causes the downmodulation of MCL-1 expression by triggering a cellular stress response that represses translation. The repression of MCL-1 renders leukemic cells highly sensitive to synergistic cell death induced by ABT-263 in a mouse model of BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL both in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, DHA synergizes with ABT-263 in human Ph(+) ALL cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts of Ph(+) ALL in culture.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combining DHA with ABT-263 can improve therapeutic response in BCR-ABL(+) B-ALL.

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of thymocytes. Using a transgenic screen in zebrafish, thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) was uncovered as a collaborating oncogenic driver that accelerated T-ALL onset by expanding the initiating pool of transformed clones and elevating genomic instability. TOX is highly expressed in a majority of human T-ALL and is required for proliferation and continued xenograft growth in mice. Using a wide array of functional analyses, we uncovered that TOX binds directly to KU70/80 and suppresses recruitment of this complex to DNA breaks to inhibit nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Impaired NHEJ is well known to cause genomic instability, including development of T-cell malignancies in KU70- and KU80-deficient mice. Collectively, our work has uncovered important roles for TOX in regulating NHEJ by elevating genomic instability during leukemia initiation and sustaining leukemic cell proliferation following transformation.Significance: TOX is an HMG box-containing protein that has important roles in T-ALL initiation and maintenance. TOX inhibits the recruitment of KU70/KU80 to DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting NHEJ repair. Thus, TOX is likely a dominant oncogenic driver in a large fraction of human T-ALL and enhances genomic instability. Cancer Discov; 7(11); 1336-53.

Epub 2017 Sep 30.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are enzymes that catalyze the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNAs. Inosine exhibits similar properties as guanosine. As a result, A-to-I editing has a great impact on edited RNAs, not only affecting the base pairing properties, but also altering codons after translation. A-to-I editing are known to mediate and diversify transcripts. However, the overall biological effect of ADARs are still largely unknown. Aberrant ADAR activity and editing dysregulation are present in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, glioblastoma and melanoma. ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing can influence uncontrolled nucleotide changes, resulting in susceptibility of cells to developmental defects and potential carcinogenicity. A deeper understanding of the biological function of ADARs may provide mechanistic insights in the development of new cancer therapy. Here, we discuss recent advances in research on ADAR in detail including the structure and function of ADARs, the biochemistry of ADAR-mediated RNA editing, and the relevance of ADAR proteins in cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that SALL4 exerts its effect by recruiting important epigenetic factors such as DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). Both of these proteins are critically involved in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia, which has a very poor clinical prognosis. Recently, SALL4 has been further linked to the functions of MLL and its target gene homeobox A9 (HOXA9). However, it remains unclear whether SALL4 is indeed a key player in MLL-r leukemia pathogenesis. METHODS: Using a mouse bone marrow retroviral transduction/ transplantation approach combined with tamoxifen-inducible, CreER(T2)-mediated Sall4 gene deletion, we studied SALL4 functions in leukemic transformation that was induced by MLL-AF9-one of the most common MLL-r oncoproteins found in patients. In addition, the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms were explored using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-Seq), mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR, histone modification, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. The effects of SALL4 loss on normal hematopoiesis in mice were also investigated. RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that SALL4 expression is critically required for MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation and disease progression in mice. Loss of SALL4 in MLL-AF9-transformed cells induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1. ChIP-Seq assay identified that Sall4 binds to key MLL-AF9 target genes and important MLL-r or non-MLL-r leukemia-related genes. ChIP-PCR assays indicated that SALL4 affects the levels of the histone modification markers H3K79me2/3 and H3K4me3 at MLL-AF9 target gene promoters by physically interacting with DOT1-like histone H3K79 methyltransferase (DOT1l) and LSD1/KDM1A, and thereby regulates transcript expression. Surprisingly, normal Sall4 (f/f) /CreER(T2) mice treated with tamoxifen or vav-Cre-mediated (hematopoietic-specific) Sall4 (-/-) mice were healthy and displayed no significant hematopoietic defects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that SALL4 critically contributes to MLL-AF9-induced leukemia, unraveling the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in this disease and suggesting that selectively targeting the SALL4 pathway may be a promising approach for managing human MLL-r leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DOT1l', '*Epigenetic', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Histone methylation', '*LSD1', '*Transcription factor']",PMC5627455,"['P30 AI036211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL121294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024574/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigate the frequency of hematological malignancies, their relative primary and secondary occurrences, and further characterize the distinct histopathologies of these malignancies with a special focus on lymphomas. To our knowledge this is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of breast hematologic malignancies. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of our institution's pathology database for hematologic neoplasms diagnosed in breast tissue during a period of 22 years (1992-2014). Clinical characteristics, patient history, histologic subtype, and patient outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 52 cases; 46 lymphomas, 4 plasmacytomas, and 2 myeloid sarcomas. The lymphoma cases were 15 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), 14 follicular lymphomas (FLs), 8 marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), 2 anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas, 2 peripheral T-cell lymphomas-not otherwise specified, 1 each of small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. In total, 30 cases were primary and 22 cases were secondary to the breast. Primary lymphomas accounted for 60% of lymphomas. Most FLs and almost all MZLs were primary. CONCLUSIONS: Primary hematological malignancies of the breast are more common than secondary: 58 % versus 42%. This finding is more evident in lymphomas: 63% versus 37%. The most common hematological malignancy in our study was DLBCL, followed by FL and MZL. Most FLs and almost all MZLs were primary. At the same time, the percentage of primary DLBCLs in our study is lower than the percentage reported in previous studies. We suggest that this could be the result of transformation from low-grade lymphomas. Although rare, hematological malignancies of the breast warrant a higher level of clinical suspicion as they present similarly to breast carcinomas but require a substantially different therapeutic approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia have been reported after idarubicin treatment. Dexrazoxane is the only medication approved by FDA to prevent anthracycline-evoked cardiotoxicity. However, lack of information on the genomic damage caused by the combination of these 2 drugs prompted us to conduct the current study. We treated mice with different doses of idarubicin and/or dexrazoxane. Genomic DNA damage, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated in the bone marrow cells. Our results demonstrate that mice pretreated of with dexrazoxane had significant lower genomic damage, apoptosis and ROS generation compared with that of mice treated with idarubicin alone, an effect that was dependent on dexrazoxane dose. The expression of 84 genes implicated in DNA damage-signaling pathways was quantified using an RT2 Profiler PCR Array. Idarubicin treatments altered the expression of 58 genes, and 16 of those were expressed at significantly different level. In treatments combining idarubicin and dexrazoxane, substantial restorations of mRNA expression of these genes were observed. RT-qPCR was performed for selected genes and the alteration of these genes was confirmed. Alterations in mRNA expression of a subset of genes were further proved by Western blotting analysis of protein levels, which nearly showed similar alterations. Conclusively, dexrazoxane can be safely co-administered with idarubicin. Moreover, dexrazoxane minimizes idarubicin-evoked genomic damage via its radical scavenging and DNA repair-enhancing activities. Thus, dexrazoxane may help avert secondary malignancies in cancer patients in remission who are exposed to idarubicin.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Here, using high-resolution optical tweezers to follow the activity of the murine leukemia Virus RT, we show that strand-displacement polymerization is frequently interrupted. Abundant pauses are modulated by the strength of the DNA duplex approximately 8 bp ahead, indicating the existence of uncharacterized RT/DNA interactions, and correspond to backtracking of the enzyme, whose recovery is also modulated by the duplex strength. Dissociation and reinitiation events, which induce long periods of inactivity and are likely the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the genome in vivo, are modulated by the template structure and the viral nucleocapsid protein. Our results emphasize the potential regulatory role of conserved structural motifs, and may provide useful information for the development of potent and specific inhibitors.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) type III promoters (U6 or H1) are typically used to drive shRNA expression. While useful for some knockdown applications, the robust expression of U6/H1-driven shRNAs can induce toxicity and generate heterogeneous small RNAs with undesirable off-target effects. Additionally, typical U6/H1 promoters encompass the majority of the approximately 270 base pairs (bp) of vector space required for shRNA expression. This can limit the efficacy and/or number of delivery vector options, particularly when delivery of multiple gene/shRNA combinations is required. Here, we develop a compact shRNA (cshRNA) expression system based on retroviral microRNA (miRNA) gene architecture that uses RNAP III type II promoters. We demonstrate that cshRNAs coded from as little as 100 bps of total coding space can precisely generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are active in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We provide an algorithm with a user-friendly interface to design cshRNAs for desired target genes. This cshRNA expression system reduces the coding space required for shRNA expression by >2-fold as compared to the typical U6/H1 promoters, which may facilitate therapeutic RNAi applications where delivery vector space is limiting.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

The developmental stage of the block in haematopoietic specification is not known. We show that Lmo2-/- mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated to Flk-1+ haemangioblasts, but less efficiently to haemogenic endothelium, which only produced primitive haematopoietic progenitors. Genome-wide approaches indicated that LMO2 is required at the haemangioblast stage to position the TAL1/LMO2/LDB1 complex to regulatory elements that are important for the establishment of the haematopoietic developmental program. In the absence of LMO2, the target site recognition of TAL1 is impaired. The lack of LMO2 resulted in altered gene expression levels already at the haemangioblast stage, with transcription factor genes accounting for approximately 15% of affected genes. Comparison of Lmo2-/- with Tal1-/- Flk-1+ cells further showed that TAL1 was required to initiate or sustain Lmo2 expression.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 96 adolescent and adult cases of Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia to evaluate whether allo-HSCT should be performed after first complete remission (1CR). Results: In total, 34 patients received chemotherapy followed by allo-HSCT (HSCT group) and 62 received chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group). No significant differences in the event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival were observed between the two groups. In the chemotherapy group, use of pediatric regimens was significantly associated with favorable EFS, while high white blood cell (WBC) count and CD20 positivity were associated with poor outcome. In patients who received pediatric regimens, subsequent allo-HSCT did not influence EFS. In patients who received conventional chemotherapy (adult regimen), subsequent allo-HSCT did not improve EFS. High WBC count and CD20 positivity were also significantly associated with poor EFS in patients who received adult regimens. Patients with low WBC count and absence of CD20 who received adult regimens did not benefit from allo-HSCT. Conclusions: Allo-HSCT may not be required in the pediatric regimen-eligible patients; however, pediatric regimen-ineligible patients with either CD20 positivity or high WBC count should receive allo-HSCT after achieving 1CR.

METHODS: Forty-one children with ALL were studied at the end of induction. Two samples were obtained from each iliac spine and each sample was assayed twice. Assay, sample and side-to-side variation were quantified by analysis of variance and presumptively incorrect decisions related to high-risk disease were determined using the result from each MRD assay, the mean MRD in the patient as the measure of the true value, and each of 3 different MRD cut-off levels which have been used for making decisions on treatment. RESULTS: Variation between assays, samples and sides each differed significantly from zero and the overall standard deviation for a single MRD estimation was 0.60 logs. Multifocal residual disease seemed to be at least partly responsible for the variation between samples. Decision errors occurred at a frequency of 13-14% when the mean patient MRD was between 10-2 and 10-5. Decision errors were observed only for an MRD result within 1 log of the cut-off value used for assessing high risk. Depending on the cut-off used, 31-40% of MRD results were within 1 log of the cut-off value and 21-16% of such results would have resulted in a decision error. CONCLUSION: When the result obtained for the level of MRD is within 1 log of the cut-off value used for making decisions, variation in the assay and/or sampling may result in a misleading assessment of the true level of marrow MRD. This may lead to an incorrect decision on treatment.",,,,PMC5626434,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"BACKGROUND: The current study followed-up site-specific cancer risks in an unique cohort with 30 years' follow-up after long-term low-dose-rate radiation exposure in Taiwan. METHODS: Six thousand two hundred and forty two Taiwanese people received extra exposure in residential and school buildings constructed with Co-60-contaminated steel from 1982 until informed and relocated in early 1990s. The additional doses received have been estimated. During 1983-2012, 300 cancer cases were identified through the national cancer registry in Taiwan, 247 cases with minimum latent periods from initial exposure. The hazard ratios (HR) of site-specific cancers were estimated with additional cumulative exposure estimated individually. RESULTS: Dose-dependent risks were statistically significantly increased for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (HR100mSv 1.18; 90% CI 1.04-1.28), breast cancers (HR100mSv 1.11; 90% CI 1.05-1.20), and all cancers (HR100mSv 1.05; 90% CI 1.0-1.08, P=0.04). Women with an initial age of exposure lower than 20 were shown with dose response increase in breast cancers risks (HR100mSv 1.38; 90% CI 1.14-1.60; P=0.0008).

Paternal diabetes did not alter offspring ALL risk, and we found no association between offspring ALL and later maternal risk of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless that absolute ALL risk among offspring of women with diabetes remains low, our findings suggest that characteristics of the diabetic intrauterine environment promote ALL development.

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), is approved for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Besides directly inhibiting BTK, ibrutinib possesses immunomodulatory properties through targeting multiple signaling pathways. Understanding how this ancillary property of ibrutinib modifies the CLL microenvironment is crucial for further exploration of immune responses in this disease and devising future combination therapies. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of ibrutinib. In peripheral blood samples collected prospectively from CLL patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy, we observed selective and durable downregulation of PD-L1 on CLL cells by 3 months post-treatment. Further analysis showed that this effect was mediated through inhibition of the constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in CLL cells. Similar downregulation of PD-1 was observed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We also demonstrated reduced interleukin (IL)-10 production by CLL cells in patients receiving ibrutinib, which was also linked to suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for immunomodulation by ibrutinib through inhibition of the STAT3 pathway, critical in inducing and sustaining tumor immune tolerance. The data also merit testing of combination treatments combining ibrutinib with agents capable of augmenting its immunomodulatory effects.",,,,PMC6128536,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS953732'],,,,,,,

However, comprehensive data on the frequency and prognostic value of subclonal mutations in well-defined subgroups using highly sensitive and quantitative methods are lacking. Targeted deep sequencing of 13 RAS pathway genes was performed in 461 pediatric BCP-ALL cases at initial diagnosis and in 19 diagnosis-relapse pairs. Mutations were present in 44.2% of patients, with 24.1% carrying a clonal mutation. Mutation frequencies were highest in high hyperdiploid, infant t(4;11)-rearranged, BCR-ABL1-like and B-other cases (50-70%), whereas mutations were less frequent in ETV6-RUNX1-rearranged, and rare in TCF3-PBX1- and BCR-ABL1-rearranged cases (27-4%). RAS pathway-mutated cells were more resistant to prednisolone and vincristine ex vivo. Clonal, but not subclonal, mutations were linked to unfavorable outcome in standard- and high-risk-treated patients. At relapse, most RAS pathway mutations were clonal (9 of 10). RAS mutant cells were sensitive to the MEK inhibitor trametinib ex vivo, and trametinib sensitized resistant cells to prednisolone. We conclude that RAS pathway mutations are frequent, and that clonal, but not subclonal, mutations are associated with unfavorable risk parameters in newly diagnosed pediatric BCP-ALL. These mutations may designate patients eligible for MEK inhibitor treatment.",,,,PMC5886052,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"NK cells, lymphocytes of the innate immune system, are important for defense against infectious pathogens and cancer. Classically, the CD56dim NK cell subset is thought to mediate antitumor responses, whereas the CD56bright subset is involved in immunomodulation. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that brief priming with IL-15 markedly enhanced the antitumor response of CD56bright NK cells. Priming improved multiple CD56bright cell functions: degranulation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine production. Primed CD56bright cells from leukemia patients demonstrated enhanced responses to autologous blasts in vitro, and primed CD56bright cells controlled leukemia cells in vivo in a murine xenograft model. Primed CD56bright cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patients displayed superior responses to autologous myeloma targets, and furthermore, CD56bright NK cells from MM patients primed with the IL-15 receptor agonist ALT-803 in vivo displayed enhanced ex vivo functional responses to MM targets. Effector mechanisms contributing to IL-15-based priming included improved cytotoxic protein expression, target cell conjugation, and LFA-1-, CD2-, and NKG2D-dependent activation of NK cells.

CLL is the most common type of the adult leukemia in the Western world. The disease is incurable, albeit there are new molecular and immunotherapy methods currently available in conjunction with chemotherapy, leading to the ""precision therapy"". The majority of immunotherapeutic approaches are based on the ability of therapeutic antibodies (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) to mobilize anti-tumour potential of the Natural Killer cells and macrophages/monocytes through their Fcg-receptors (FcgammaR). Therefore functional status of monocytes in CLL is an important contributor to the efficacy of this treatment. In addition, CLL patients are characterized by a profound immunodeficiency, and how this affects monocytes, has not been established. Here we study ex vivo phagocytic function and the expression of Fcg receptors and CD180 toll-like receptor (TLR) by monocytes of 14 untreated and 8 treated with Cyclophosmamide, Adriamycin, Prednisolone (COP) CLL patients, and 12 age-matched control volunteers. Phagocytic function was assessed through the ability of freshly isolated monocytes to attach and to engulf intact or opsonized Staphylococcus aureus particles in vitro with or without Granulocyte/Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and Interferon g (IFNg). Simultaneously, immunophenotyping for FcgammaRI (CD64), FcgammaRII (CD32), FcgammaRIII (CD16) and CD180 has been carried out. The results were assessed by Flow Cytometry. Our results demonstrated that phagocytosis of the intact and opsonised or intact S. aureus by monocytes of CLL patients was significantly decreased in comparison with normal controls, with no recovery upon the treatment with GM-CSF and IFNg. A significant decrease in the expression of CD64 and CD180 has been detected on monocytes of CLL patients, with the drop in CD64 expression correlating with the disease progression and advanced Rai stages. In addition, the treatment with COP led to a more profound decrease in the expression of CD64. No appreciable changes were detected in the expression of CD32 and CD16 throughout the experiments. The diminished expression of CD64 and CD180 provides possible explanation for the impaired phagocytic function of monocytes in CLL, as FcgammaRI receptor interaction with opsonising IgG1, and CD180 with the ligands on S. aureus might affect the ability of monocytes to attach and to engulf S. aureus particles and effectively eliminate the pathogen. Our data indicates that the decreased functional status of monocytes in CLL might contribute to the diminished efficacy of therapeutic antibodies as well as to the immunodeficiency, characteristic for these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite excellent response rates, resistance or intolerance may develop. We conducted a retrospective review of the outcome of patients with chronic (CP) and accelerated (AP) phase CML refractory to prior TKI who discontinued ponatinib for resistance or intolerance. Nineteen CP patients, discontinued due to resistance (n = 13), toxicity (n = 5) and to pursue stem cell transplantation (n = 1). At discontinuation, 14 were still in CP, three had progressed to AP and two to blast phase (BP). Three CP patients improved their cytogenetic response (CyR) to complete CyR (CCyR), two after SCT and one on omacetaxine. None of the 12 patients, without a major cytogenetic response at ponatinib discontinuation, including all patients treated with subsequent TKIs, responded to therapy. Seventeen AP patients, stopped ponatinib due to resistance (n = 15) or intolerance (n = 2). At discontinuation, 14 were still in AP and three had progressed to BP. Four patients were treated with SCT and one achieved major molecular response. None of the 12 patients treated with non-SCT approaches responded to subsequent therapy. Median survival for all patients was 16.6 months after ponatinib discontinuation (31, 9 and 13 months for patients in CP, AP and BP, respectively). Median survival was 60 months for patients who discontinued ponatinib for toxicity and 11 months for those who discontinued for resistance.

Selection of an appropriate first-line therapy can be difficult as both the unique characteristics of each TKI and patient need to be taken into account to find the optimal match. Patient characteristics include comorbidities, concomitant medications, lifestyle, risk factors, BCR-ABL1 transcript type (e.g. b2a2 or b3a2) and additional chromosomal abnormalities. Just as patients differ, side effects, drug-drug interactions, administration plans, dosing schedules and treatment-related expenses across TKIs also vary. Alignment of these characteristics with the appropriate TKI is key to successfully initiating CML treatment. Continued success relies on communication between the patient and the healthcare team, adherence and optimization of therapy once it is initiated. In this review, we discuss these factors, in addition to TKI efficacy and safety, the cost of therapy, the future of treating CML and treatment-free remission.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myeloid leukemias and dysplasias', '*myeloproliferative disorders', '*signaling therapies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 9.,"INTRODUCTION: Venetoclax, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2, was approved in 2016 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with 17p deletion [del(17p)], who have received at least one prior therapy. Areas covered: We focus on the mechanism of action of venetoclax and on the clinical trial data that led to the approval of venetoclax for CLL patients. We also review the studies in which this drug has being explored in combination with other anti-CLL drugs. Expert opinion: Data from early clinical trials have shown that venetoclax, as a single agent, is highly effective for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, including those cases with high-risk features. Furthermore, venetoclax seems to be an appropriate option for patients who progress on B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway kinase inhibitors. Venetoclax is also safe, with the most common serious adverse events being neutropenia.

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that acquire somatic mutations, leading to disease and clonogenic evolution. AML is characterized by accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and phenotypic cellular heterogeneity reflective of normal hematopoietic differentiation. Here, we show that JAM-C expression defines a subset of leukemic cells endowed with leukemia-initiating cell activity (LIC). Stratification of de novo AML patients at diagnosis based on JAM-C-expressing cells frequencies in the blood served as an independent prognostic marker for disease outcome. Using publicly available leukemic stem cell (LSC) gene expression profiles and gene expression data generated from JAM-C-expressing leukemic cells, we defined a single cell core gene expression signature correlated to JAM-C expression that reveals LSC heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrated that JAM-C controls Src family kinase (SFK) activation in LSC and that LIC with exacerbated SFK activation was uniquely found within the JAM-C-expressing LSC compartment.

Epub 2017 Oct 2.,"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), also referred to as BCR-ABL1-like ALL, is a high-risk subset with a gene expression profile that shares significant overlap with that of Ph-positive (Ph(+)) ALL and is suggestive of activated kinase signaling. Although Ph(+) ALL is defined by BCR-ABL1 fusion, Ph-like ALL cases contain a variety of genomic alterations that activate kinase and cytokine receptor signaling. These alterations can be grouped into major subclasses that include ABL-class fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB that phenocopy BCR-ABL1 and alterations of CRLF2, JAK2, and EPOR that activate JAK/STAT signaling. Additional genomic alterations in Ph-like ALL activate other kinases, including BLNK, DGKH, FGFR1, IL2RB, LYN, NTRK3, PDGFRA, PTK2B, TYK2, and the RAS signaling pathway. Recent studies have helped to define the genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL and how it varies across the age spectrum, associated clinical features and outcomes, and genetic risk factors. Preclinical studies and anecdotal reports show that targeted inhibitors of relevant signaling pathways are active in specific Ph-like ALL subsets, and precision medicine trials have been initiated for this high-risk ALL subset.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC5680607,"['K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

By applying next-generation functional testing of primary patient-derived lymphoma cells using a library of 106 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drugs or compounds currently in clinical development, we set out to identify novel effective treatments for T-PLL patients. We found that the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) demonstrated the strongest T-PLL-specific response when comparing individual ex vivo drug response in 86 patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Mechanistically, responses to venetoclax correlated with protein expression of BCL-2 but not with expression of the BCL-2 family members myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) and BCL-XL in lymphoma cells. BCL-2 expression was inversely correlated with the expression of MCL-1. Based on the ex vivo responses, venetoclax treatment was commenced in 2 late-stage refractory T-PLL patients resulting in clinical responses. Our findings demonstrate first evidence of single-agent activity of venetoclax both ex vivo and in humans, offering a novel agent in T-PLL.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,['P 27132/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,['Blood. 2017 Dec 7;130(23 ):2447-2448.

To uncover new strategies to restore thymic function and adaptive immunity in immunodeficiency, we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms that control life and death decisions in TECs. Guided by gene expression profiling, we created mouse models that specifically deleted prosurvival genes in TECs. We found that although BCL-2 and BCL-XL were dispensable for TEC homeostasis, MCL-1 deficiency impacted on TECs as early as embryonic day 15.5, resulting in early thymic atrophy and T-cell lymphopenia, with near complete loss of thymic tissue by 2 months of age. MCL-1 was not necessary for TEC differentiation but was continually required for the survival of mature cortical and medullary TECs and the maintenance of thymic architecture. A screen of TEC trophic factors in organ cultures showed that epidermal growth factor upregulated MCL-1 via MAPK/ERK kinase activity, providing a molecular mechanism for the support of TEC survival. This signaling axis governing TEC survival and thymic function represents a new target for strategies for thymic protection and regeneration.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC6207344,"['105045/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '105045/Z/14/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,['EMS79733'],,['Blood. 2017 Dec 7;130(23 ):2448-2450.

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome is a long-term complication of cancer treatment in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy, characterized by high-risk genetics and poor outcomes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only potential cure for this disease, but the prognostic impact of pre-transplant genetics and clinical features has not yet been fully characterized. We report here the genetic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of a relatively large cohort of patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (n=67) who underwent allogeneic transplantation, comparing these patients to similarly treated patients with de novo disease (n=199). The 5-year overall survival was not different between patients with therapy-related and de novo disease (49.9% versus 53.9%; P=0.61) despite a higher proportion of individuals with an Intermediate-2/High International Prognostic Scoring System classification (59.7% versus 43.7%; P=0.003) and high-risk karyotypes (61.2% versus 30.7%; P<0.01) among the patients with therapy-related disease. In mutational analysis, TP53 alteration was the most common abnormality in patients with therapy-related disease (n=18: 30%). Interestingly, the presence of mutations in TP53 or in any other of the high-risk genes (EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, ASXL1: n=29: 48%) did not significantly affect either overall survival or relapse-free survival. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is, therefore, a curative treatment for patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, conferring a similar long-term survival to that of patients with de novo disease despite higher-risk features. While TP53 alteration was the most common mutation in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, the finding was not detrimental in our case-series.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5709102,['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Haematologica. 2017 Dec;102(12):1970-1971.

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are provided with essential survival and proliferative signals in the lymph node microenvironment. Here, CLL cells engage in various interactions with bystander cells such as T cells and macrophages. Phenotypically distinct types of tumor infiltrating macrophages can either be tumor supportive (M2) or play a role in tumor immune surveillance (M1). Although recent in vitro findings suggest a protective role for macrophages in CLL, the actual balance between these macrophage subsets in CLL lymphoid tissue is still unclear. Furthermore, the mechanism of recruitment of monocytes towards the CLL lymph node is currently unknown. Both questions are addressed in this paper. Immunofluorescence staining of lymph node samples showed macrophage skewing towards an M2 tumor-promoting phenotype. This polarization likely results from CLL-secreted soluble factors, as both patient serum and CLL-conditioned medium recapitulated the skewing effect. Considering that CLL cell cytokine secretion is affected by adjacent T cells, we next studied CLL-mediated monocyte recruitment in the presence or absence of T-cell signals. While unstimulated CLL cells were inactive, T cell-stimulated CLL cells actively recruited monocytes. This correlated with secretion of various chemokines such as C-C-motif-ligand-2,3,4,5,7,24, C-X-C-motif-ligand-5,10, and Interleukin-10. We also identified CD40L as the responsible T-cell factor that mediated recruitment, and showed that recruitment critically depended on the C-C-motif-chemokine-receptor-2 axis. These studies show that the shaping of a tumor supportive microenvironment depends on cytokinome alterations (including C-C-motif-ligand-2) that occur after interactions between CLL, T cells and monocytes. Therefore, targeted inhibition of CD40L or C-C-motif-chemokine-receptor-2 may be relevant therapeutic options.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5709106,,,,,,,,,,,,

Global evaluation of circRNA expression in sorted healthy hematopoietic controls (n=10) and acute myeloid leukemia (n=10) reveals circRNA transcripts for 47.9% of all highly expressed genes.

The optimal treatment approach and the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are not entirely clear. In this study, we investigated 519 patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia in first complete remission who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2000 and 2014, and who were reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). Median age was 38.1 years (range 18-75). Cytogenetics classified 49.3% as poor risk. At three years, relapse incidence was 31.4% (26.9-35.9), non-relapse mortality was 22.1% (18.4-26.1), the leukemia-free survival was 46.5% (41.7-51.4), and the overall survival was 56.3% (51.5-61.2). At six months, 32.5% had developed acute graft-versus-host disease, while at three years, 37.5% had developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (32.6-42.3). In a multivariate analysis, age and year of transplant had a strong impact on outcome. Myeloablative conditioning using total body irradiation correlated with a better leukemia-free survival. Our study suggests that mixed phenotype acute leukemia is potentially sensitive to graft-versus-leukemia and thus can benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a potential for cure.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5709113,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 31.,"The aim of the study was to assess the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients diagnosed with BCR-ABL1-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Fifty-seven patients (median age, 48 years, range: 19-67) with BCR-ABL1 positive AML undergoing SCT were identified. The majority of the patients (70%) received a TKI before the transplant. At SCT 48 patients were in CR (45 in CR1), while 9 patients were transplanted in a more advanced stage of the disease. MRD was negative (BCR-ABL1/ABL < 10(4) ) at time of SCT in 36.1% (14/40). After SCT, 16 (61.5%) out of 26 patients with MRD positive at transplantation reached MRD negativity. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years (0.7-14.2), NRM, RI, LFS, OS, and GRFS at 5 years were 18.1%, 37%, 44.2%, 53.8%, and 32.1%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GvHD grade II-IV was 16.4%, incidence of chronic GvHD 24.9%, and of extensive cGvHD 21.4%, respectively. In patients who received SCT in CR1, 5-yr NRM, RI, LFS, OS, and GRFS were 15.9%, 36.4%, 46.5%, 59.4%, and 34.9%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age (<50 vs. >/=50 years) was associated with RI (5-yr: 22.7 vs. 50%), LFS (5-yr: 61.9 vs. 31.8%), and GRFS (5-yr: 52.4 vs. 18.2%), whereas MRD-negative status before SCT was associated with an improved GRFS (38.9 vs. 16.7%). We conclude that the outcome of patients <50 years of age with BCR-ABL1-positive AML receiving allogeneic SCT in CR is relatively favorable, possibly reflecting the beneficial effect of the use of TKI.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 31.,"Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a biologically, clinically, and genetically distinct subtype of precursor-B ALL. The Ph chromosome, results from a reciprocal translocation of the ABL1 kinase gene on chromosome 9 to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22. Depending on the translocation breakpoint, typically a p210 BCR-ABL1 or a p190 BCR-ABL onc protein are generated; both are constitutively active tyrosine kinases that play a central role to alter signaling pathways of cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal, leading to leukemogenesis. In Ph-positive ALL, the p190-BCR-ABL (minor [m]-bcr) subtype is more frequent than the p210-BCR-ABL (major [M]-bcr) subtype, commonly found in chronic myeloid leukemia. The Philadelphia chromosome is the most frequent recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in elderly patients with ALL. Its incidence increases with age, reaching approximately 50% in patients with ALL aged 60 years and over. Patients traditionally had a very poor outcome with chemotherapy, particularly if they do not undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in first complete remission (CR1). With the availability of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding quickly. However, there is no consensus on how to best treat Ph-positive ALL. With modern therapy, improved outcomes have led to the emergence of a number of controversies, including the need for intensive chemotherapy, the ideal TKI, and whether all eligible patients should receive an allo-HSCT, and if so, what type. Here, we discuss these controversies in light of the available literature.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last years, immunogenetic studies have identified that approximately 30% of CLL patients carry (quasi)identical BcR IG and thus can be assigned to different subsets with distinct clinicobiological profiles. This characterization was achieved by applying rules mainly concerning the diversity of the VH complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3). Following, studies have also identified subset-specific somatic hypermutation further highlighting antigen selection in disease ontogeny and evolution. In this study, an innovative attempt to explore possible associations amongst SHMs in different CLL patients is implemented and also the potential correlations with VH CDR3 stereotypy is examined, leading to a new classification algorithm implicating both SHM and CDR3 patterns. All results are classified to a ground level analysis, focusing on the most frequent SHMs, their paired associated amino acid changes and the formation of subgroups sharing the same VH CDR3 pattern, the latter being used as a similarity metric. In addition, all results are compared to established VH CDR3 patterns of the well-known CLL subsets in order to confirm the validity of our findings.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CDR3 patterns', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)', 'Mutation Association', 'Somatic Hypermutation (SHM)', 'Visual Analytics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 2.,"Pleural effusion (PE) represents the leading cause of dasatinib (DAS) discontinuation. However, the pathogenic mechanism of this adverse event (AE) is unknown and its management unclear. We investigated if a DAS dose reduction after the first PE would prevent the recurrence of this AE. We retrospectively collected data on all the cases of PE in CML-chronic phase (CP) DAS-treated patients from November 2005 to February 2017 in 21 Italian hematological centers. We identified 196 cases of PE in a series of 853 CML-CP DAS-treated patients (incidence 23.0%). DAS starting dose was 100 mg/day in 70.4% of patients, less than 100 mg/day in 14.3%, and more than 100 mg/day in the remaining cases. Median time from DAS start to PE was 16.6 months. At first PE development, 28.6% of patients were in MMR, and 37.8% in deep molecular response (DMR). DAS was temporary interrupted in 71.9% of cases, with a dose reduction in 59.2%. Recurrence was observed in 59.4% of the cases. Treatment was definitively discontinued due to PE in 29.1% of the cases. Interestingly, among patients whose DAS dosage was reduced, 59.5% experienced PE recurrence. DAS dose reduction after the first episode of PE did not prevent recurrence of this AE. Therefore, once a MMR or a DMR is achieved, different strategies of DAS dose management can be proposed prior to the development of PE, such as daily dose reduction or, as an alternative option, an on/off treatment with a weekend drug holiday.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose reduction', 'Molecular response', 'Pleural effusion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although its exact pathogenesis is unknown, aAA is thought to be driven by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-restricted T cell immunity, with earlier studies favoring HLA class II-mediated pathways. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we recently identified two aAA patients with somatic mutations in HLA class I genes. We hypothesized that HLA class I mutations are pathognomonic for autoimmunity in aAA, but were previously underappreciated because the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region is notoriously difficult to analyze by WES. Using a combination of targeted deep sequencing of HLA class I genes and single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) genotyping we screened 66 aAA patients for somatic HLA class I loss. We found somatic HLA loss in eleven patients (17%), with thirteen loss-of-function mutations in HLA-A*33:03, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*14:02 and HLA-B*40:02 alleles. Three patients had more than one mutation targeting the same HLA allele. Interestingly, HLA-B*14:02 and HLA-B*40:02 were significantly overrepresented in aAA patients, compared to ethnicity-matched controls. Patients who inherited the targeted HLA alleles, regardless of HLA mutation status, had a more severe disease course with more frequent clonal complications as assessed by WES, SNP-A, and metaphase cytogenetics, and more frequent secondary MDS. The finding of recurrent HLA class I mutations provides compelling evidence for a predominant HLA class I-driven autoimmunity in aAA, and establishes a novel link between aAA patients' immunogenetics and clonal evolution.",,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA', 'aplastic anemia', 'autoimmunity', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",PMC5621748,"['T32 DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK100836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL132101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL122306/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 DK103001/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial', 'interests.']",,,['NIHMS901710'],,,,,,,

Our azobenzene-containing peptides selectively block the WDR5-MLL1 interaction by binding to WDR5 with high affinity (Ki = 1.25 nM). We determined the co-crystal structure of this photoswitchable peptiomimetic with WDR5 to understand the interaction at the atomic level. Importantly, the photoswitchable trans and cis conformers of the probe display a clear difference in their inhibition of MLL1. We further demonstrate that the designed photo-controllable azo-peptidomimetics affect the transcription of the MLL1-target gene Deptor, which regulates hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, and inhibit the growth of leukemia cells. This strategy demonstrates the potential of photopharmacological inhibition of methyltransferase protein-protein interactions as a novel method for external epigenetic control, providing a new toolbox for controlling epigenetic states.",,,,PMC5618341,['R01 GM082856/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We present a case series of ten such patients in a 4-year period. Sixteen therapeutic leukocyte reduction (TLR) were done in ten cases along with other supportive measures. The American Society for Apheresis supports the routine implementation of TLR in cases of HL secondary to myeloid leukemias with signs of leukostasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The procedures were performed on the intermittent flow cell separator after discussion with the treating physician about patient's condition. Clinical, demographic, analytical, and technical variables were reviewed retrospectively and the patients were followed up at the end of 4 years. Descriptive analysis was performed for all variables, and relationships between quantitative variables and categorical variables were determined by applying the Student's t-test. RESULTS: The mean age of presentation was 34 years. Priapism was the most common symptom followed by respiratory distress and neurological disturbances. After an average of 1.6 TLR procedures, the mean leukocyte count reduction achieved was 39.9% along with symptomatic relief. The mean survival at 4-year follow-up was 12.8 months and the overall mortality was 20%. Acute myeloid leukemia patients presented with lower mean platelet counts compared to chronic myeloid leukemia patients; however, the platelet loss in the final product was minimized. CONCLUSION: TLR is a safe and effective therapy for leukoreduction in hematological malignancies in our experience.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hyperleukocytosis', 'leukemia', 'leukocytapheresis', 'therapeutic leukocyte reduction', 'tumor lysis syndrome']",PMC5613424,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Most patients are characterised by an indolent disease course and an anergic phenotype of their leukaemia cells, which refers to a state of unresponsiveness to B cell receptor stimulation. Up to 10% of CLL patients transform from an indolent subtype to an aggressive form of B cell lymphoma over time (Richter s syndrome) and show a significantly worse treatment outcome. Here we show that B cell-specific ablation of Nfat2 leads to the loss of the anergic phenotype culminating in a significantly compromised life expectancy and transformation to aggressive disease. We further define a gene expression signature of anergic CLL cells consisting of several NFAT2-dependent genes including Cbl-b, Grail, Egr2 and Lck. In summary, this study identifies NFAT2 as a crucial regulator of the anergic phenotype in CLL.NFAT2 is a transcription factor that has been linked with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), but its functions in CLL manifestation are still unclear. Here the authors show, by analysing mouse CLL models and characterising biopsies from CLL patients, that NFAT2 is an important regulator for the anergic phenotype of CLL.",,,,PMC5624906,['R01 AI040127/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoproliferative disorders are less commonly associated with systemic mastocytosis and a few cases of systemic mastocytosis associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been described in the literature. CASE REPORT We present a case of indolent systemic mastocytosis associated with small lymphocytic lymphoma. The bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mast cells in the form of clusters and perivascular distribution on immunohistochemistry for tryptase, CD2, and CD25 markers. In addition, 30% involvement by small lymphocytic lymphoma was discovered in the form of interstitial lymphoid aggregates composed of small lymphocytes. Flow cytometry showed B-cells positively stained for CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, and kappa light chains, and the CD38 expression was <5%. CONCLUSIONS In systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease, the combination of systemic mastocytosis associated with small lymphocytic lymphoma is rare and the management strategy follows the principle of treating the two entities individually as if they are not related. Clinical surveillance is indicated for indolent systemic mastocytosis and low-risk small lymphocytic lymphoma to monitor for disease progression.",,,,PMC5637574,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is the main chemotherapeutic agent used for treating newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most frequent malignant brain tumors in adults. This alkylating agent induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) which in turn lead to apoptosis by activating the Bcl-2 controlled mitochondrial pathway. However, GBM invariably recur as tumors become resistant to TMZ. We investigated the implication of EGFR ligands in this resistance and we found that the pro Heparin Binding Epidermal Growth Factor (proHB-EGF) expression is linked to the early response to TMZ in human glioma cell lines. However, HB-EGF does not affect apoptosis per se although its expression is associated with the degradation of Mcl-1. HB-EGF is implicated in DSBs repair as silencing of HB-EGF increased gammaH2AX foci half-life as well as USP9X expression, two features that could be linked to the observed effect on Mcl-1. Our data demonstrate a new role for HB-EGF in TMZ treated cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although most children with ALL are cured of their disease, AYAs have experienced much worse outcomes over time, with event-free survival ranging from 30 to 45%. This survival disparity is likely due to differences in tumor biology, treatment-related toxicities, and nonmedical issues. This review summarizes these differences as well as focusing on the various trials that have demonstrated superior outcomes with pediatric protocols in AYAs with ALL. Even with the widespread use of these protocols, a treatment gap remains, and novel therapies are one way to address this problem. Still, these therapies also have significant toxicities and unique issues that need to be tested further, especially in the AYA population. The development of more AYA-specific trials will be an important way to examine novel therapies and interventions designed to reduce treatment-related toxicities and improve long-term outcomes.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Adolescent and young adult', '*Clinical trials', '*Immunotherapy', '*Salvage chemotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of DR is complex and several vascular, inflammatory, and neuronal mechanisms are involved. The purpose of this study was to assess the levels of immune and inflammatory biomarkers in the aqueous humor of patients with different severities of DR and to analyze the correlations between Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and these biomarkers, and between IL-6 and the severity of the disease. METHODS: Aqueous humor samples were obtained from 51 non-diabetic patients and 151 diabetic patients. Levels of 45 different cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured using a multiplex bead immunoassay. RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, Inducible Protein-10 (IP-10), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the aqueous humor of the DR patients compared to the non-diabetic patients, while the concentrations of IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-9, IL-21, IL-23, IL-27, IL-31, RANTES, interferon-alpha, growth regulated oncogene (GRO), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the DR patients. The IL-6 levels increased as the severity of DR increased. In addition, the IL-6 level positively correlated with the IL-8, HGF and LIF levels, while negatively with the IL-31and GRO levels.

Pentoxifylline, a xanthine-derivative compound indicated for the treatment of microvascular disturbancies, has been suggested to have anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activities in various types of cancer. In the present study we extend these data showing one of the potential molecular mechanisms through which Pentoxifylline may promote apoptosis in CLL clonal lymphocytes. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 15 CLL patients 0 RAI stage and 15 healthy volunteers and treated for 24 and 48 hours with Pentoxifylline. Apoptosis induction was evaluated through Annexin V and TUNEL assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization analysis, active Caspase-3 assay, reactive oxygen species generation and Western Blot were assessed to further investigate the alterations induced by Pentoxifylline. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant occurrence of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and active Caspase-3 in lymphocytes from CLL patients compared to healthy volunteers after 48 hours of Pentoxifylline treatment. To clarify the molecular mechanism of the drug, we also evaluated the expression levels of NF-kB/p65 and its related proteins. In treated CLL cells, NF-kB/p65 was significantly decreased in comparison to normal cells, whereas we observed a less marked reduction of Bcl-2 expression. The treatment also induced a decrease of Mcl-1 in CLL cells with a greater down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic alternatively spliced isoform. CONCLUSION: These findings showed that Pentoxifylline induced apoptosis in leukemic cells through a molecular mechanism that involves the NF-kB signaling.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2', 'CLL', 'Mcl-1', 'NF-kB', 'Pentoxifylline']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 1.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a significant difference in the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) patients before and during treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). This is because high ROS levels support oncogenic phenotype of CML by inducing proliferation pathway and accumulation of further genetic mutations. Often the measurement is done on WBC or serum for ascertaining one type of ROS species, but measurement of global ROS in fresh whole blood will give more accurate estimation of ROS. AIM: To measure global ROS in peripheral blood of CML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control study was undertaken to measure ROS in peripheral blood of CML patients from Northern India. CML patients on TKIs (n=40 on imatinib herein called treated) and untreated (n=17, who were not on any TKIs or alternative medicine, called as treatment naive) and 52 healthy controls were also enrolled. Chemiluminescent assay was carried out using luminol as signal enhancer in 400 microl of blood to measure ROS. The chemiluminescence was measured as Relative Light Units (RLU)/sec/104 WBC. Data was presented in terms of mean+/-SE or geometric mean (95% Confidence Interval) for continuous variables and percentage for categorical variables. Groups were compared using two sample t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. RESULTS: The WBC profile and ROS levels of patients taking TKIs were quite similar and showed no significant difference (p<0.999) compared to healthy controls. In contrast, significant increase was observed in the ROS levels of CML patients not on TKIs (untreated) compared to patients under treatment (p<0.029) and healthy controls (p<0.007). We also observed that the absolute ROS values and WBC counts were higher in untreated patients compared to patients on TKIs and healthy controls, even though mean ROS value was less. CONCLUSION: To ascertain the alterations in ROS levels of CML patients before and during treatment with TKIs, it is better to measure global ROS in fresh whole blood by chemiluminescent method using luminol. Luminol assay is a quick, easy and inexpensive method to measure global ROS. Patient under treatment with TKIs show significant decrease in ROS levels almost similar to the levels measured in healthy controls yet the mechanisms by which this decrease occurs needs to be elucidated.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Luminol assay', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'White blood cells']",PMC5620896,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter hypermethylation is one potential cause of DKK3 inactivation. However, whether other mechanisms lead to DKK3 inactivation and the subsequent effects of these inactivations on cell proliferation and the Wnt signaling pathway in adult B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that low DKK3 expression levels were associated with high miR-708 expression and promoter hypermethylation in adult B-ALL. miR-708 was confirmed to directly decrease DKK3 expression in Nalm-6 and BALL-1 cells. Additionally, a miR-708 inhibitor decreased cell proliferation mainly through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and these effects were eliminated by DKK3 siRNA treatment. Moreover, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) decreased the methylation state of the DKK3 promoter based on methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR (BSP), although this demethylation effect was not enhanced by the miR-708 inhibitor. The miR-708 inhibitor or 5-aza significantly increased DKK3 expression and decreased p-GSK3beta, cyclin D1 and nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin protein expression, indicating that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited. These effects became more pronounced when the miR-708 inhibitor and 5-aza were used simultaneously. These findings provide greater insights into the mechanisms that increase DKK3 expression and suggest that a miR-708 inhibitor and 5-aza might be useful as targeted therapies for adult B-ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"[""5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", 'DKK3', 'Wnt/beta-catenin', 'adult B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'miR-708']",PMC5609988,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the chemical composition, anticancer and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitory effects of Teucrium alopecurus leaf essential oil was investigated. The analysis of Teucrium alopecurus (TA-1) with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) showed that alpha-Bisabolol, (+)-epi-Bicyclosesquiphellandrene and alpha-Cadinol, were found in relatively high amounts (16.16%, 15.40% and 8.52%, respectively). Cell viability was determined by 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2-5-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis assay were determined by flow cytometry. TA-1 functions as an anticancer agent by triggering apoptosis potentiated by chemotherapeutic agents and TNF in human myeloid leukemia cells (KBM5) through a mechanism involving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and initiator and effector caspases activation. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that TA-1 downregulated nuclear localization of NF-kappaB and its phosphorylation induced by TNF-alpha and this, allows the suppression of the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaB and the inhibition of the phosphorylation of p65 phosphorylation and the p50-p65 heterodimer nuclear translocation, causing attenuation of NF-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic (Survivin, Bcl-2, c-IAP1/2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and cFLIP), invasion (ICAM1), metasatsis (MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF) gene expression in KBM5; and finally reporter gene expression. Furthermore, treatment with essential oil and TNF-alpha suppressed the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. Finally, the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB induced by different plasmids (TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, and IKKbeta) was inhibited following treatment with TA-1. Overall, TA-1 inhibits NF-kappaB activation and further growth and proliferation of cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The analysis of single cell expression profiles creates new challenges due to the distributive nature of the data and the stochastic dynamics of gene transcription process. The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using single cell transcriptional profiles is particularly challenging, especially when directed gene-gene relationships are desired. RESULTS: We developed SINCERITIES (SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS) for the inference of GRNs from single cell transcriptional profiles. We focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, commonly generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers directed regulatory relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression (ridge regression), using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the modes of the gene regulations (activation and repression) come from partial correlation analyses between pairs of genes. We demonstrated the efficacy of SINCERITIES in inferring GRNs using in silico time-stamped single cell expression data and single cell transcriptional profiles of THP-1 monocytic human leukemia cells. The case studies showed that SINCERITIES could provide accurate GRN predictions, significantly better than other GRN inference algorithms such as TSNI, GENIE3 and JUMP3. Moreover, SINCERITIES has a low computational complexity and is amenable to problems of extremely large dimensionality. Finally, an application of SINCERITIES to single cell expression data of T2EC chicken erythrocytes pointed to BATF as a candidate novel regulator of erythroid development. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MATLAB and R version of SINCERITIES are freely available from the following websites: http://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools/sincerities.html and https://github.com/CABSEL/SINCERITIES.

The diagnosis of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) is occasionally first encountered on liver core biopsy, but TdT immunostain specificity for B-ALL is not clearly established in this setting, which can be problematic when only a few TdT-positive cells are identified. In this study, we evaluated the incidence and distribution of immature B lymphocytes coexpressing TdT and PAX-5, in pediatric and adult liver biopsies, to determine whether a normal complement of hepatic immature B cells can be detected, which must be recognized in a workup to exclude B-ALL. We selected 41 pediatric and adult liver biopsies with a significant portal and/or sinusoidal hematolymphoid infiltrate and performed immunohistochemical stains for TdT and PAX-5 to identify and categorize distribution of immature B cells. TdT-positive cells were detected in 40% of pediatric liver biopsies with a significant hematolymphoid infiltrate (4/10), which included all biopsies from neonates (and infants under 9 wk of age). In adults, immature B-cell infiltrates were less common (6%, 2/31). Dual immunostaining was performed on 2 cases of neonatal hepatitis, which documented B-cell lineage in at least a subset of TdT-positive cells and there was no colabeling with CD3. Immature B cells can be detected in liver biopsies in a variety of clinical settings, most commonly in children, and presence of a few TdT-positive cells cannot be considered entirely specific for involvement by B-ALL. Further workup for B-ALL can be warranted if there is more extensive multifocal portal and/or sinusoidal involvement by blasts with TdT labeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 2.,"Oncogenic forms of the kinase FLT3 are important therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, clinical responses to small-molecule kinase inhibitors are short-lived as a result of the rapid emergence of resistance due to point mutations or compensatory increases in FLT3 expression. We sought to develop a complementary pharmacological approach whereby proteasome-mediated FLT3 degradation could be promoted by inhibitors of the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for cleaving ubiquitin from FLT3. Because the relevant DUBs for FLT3 are not known, we assembled a focused library of most reported small-molecule DUB inhibitors and carried out a cellular phenotypic screen to identify compounds that could induce the degradation of oncogenic FLT3. Subsequent target deconvolution efforts allowed us to identify USP10 as the critical DUB required to stabilize FLT3. Targeting of USP10 showed efficacy in preclinical models of mutant-FLT3 AML, including cell lines, primary patient specimens and mouse models of oncogenic-FLT3-driven leukemia.",,,,PMC6314479,"['MC_UP_A500_1020/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12016/5/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['PubChem-Substance/341138788', 'PubChem-Substance/341138789']",,['NIHMS997465'],,,,,,,

METHODS: Five patients with peritoneal endometriosis and infertility (case group) and four healthy fertile patients (control group) were recruited. All patients were either diagnosed with or ruled out for endometriosis by laparoscopic surgery; the case group underwent surgery for infertility investigation and the control group for tubal ligation. Endometrial biopsies were performed in all patients during the window of implantation (LH+8 to LH+10), and then the samples were analyzed by immunochemistry for MFG-E8, integrin alphavbeta3, and LIF. RESULTS: In patients with endometriosis and infertility, expression of MFG-E8 was significantly increased in the glandular epithelium when compared to healthy fertile patients (p<0.001). Moreover, LIF expression was lower in patients with endometriosis and infertility (p<0.05). Nevertheless, we found no difference in integrin alphavbeta3 expression between the groups (p=0.084). CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that MFG-E8 expression is impaired in the endometrium of patients with endometriosis and infertility during the window of implantation.

It is driven by chromosomal translocation t(15;19) involving the rearrangement of NUT (nuclear protein in testis) and BRD4 (bromodomain 4) genes leading to fusion oncoprotein BRD4-NUT. CASE PRESENTATION:: We report the case of a woman who was previously treated with induction chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and adjuvant trastuzumab for HER-2 positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. After 6 months of follow-up a lung nodule appeared. A biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma fetal type/lung blastoma, so a left inferior lobectomy was performed: NMC harboring BRD4-NUT rearrangement was diagnosed. After 9 months of follow-up, bone and soft tissue metastases occurred, so the patient was given radiotherapy. Next-generation sequencing technology identified somatic mutations in deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), mixed lineage leukemia protein 3 (MLL3), and splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) genes in NMC cells from both primitive cancer and metastases. The patient was treated with the experimental BRD4 inhibitor for 10 months, until the disease progressed to the lung and bone. After spinal cord compression, the patient was offered palliative radiotherapy to bone and eventually died aged 39 years. CONCLUSIONS:: To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first DCC, MLL3, and SF3B1 mutated NUT midline carcinoma reported in the literature. If these mutations were confirmed to play a role in this neoplasm, clinical trials analyzing targeted therapies should be considered, eg. colorectal cancer-like chemotherapies for DCC mutations, hypomethylating agents for MLL3 mutations or SF3B1 inhibitors in case of specific somatic mutations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) differentiated the leukemia cell SERS spectra (HL60 plus K562) from normal cell SERS spectra (BMC) with high sensitivity (98.3%) and specificity (98.3%). Furthermore, partial least squares (PLS) approach was employed to develop a diagnostic model. The model successfully predicted the unidentified subjects with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.7%.

Epub 2016 Jan 9.,"BACKGROUND: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is highly effective in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). It is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been shown to induce apoptosis in several tumor cell lines. However, research into its effects on colon carcinoma cells is still very limited. We previously reported that ATO is cytotoxic and causes DNA damage in HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. In the present study, we further evaluated its effect on oxidative stress (OS), and examined its apoptotic mechanisms of action on HT-29 cells. METHODS: OS was assessed by spectrophotometric measurements of MDA levels while cell cycle analysis was evaluated by flow cytometry to determine whether ATO induces cell cycle arrest. Its effect on early apoptosis was also evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect the morphological changes, and Western blotting was carried out to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. RESULTS: The lipid peroxidation assay revealed a dose-dependent increase in MDA production. DAPI staining showed morphological changes in the cell's nucleus due to apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis and Annexin V-FITC assay also demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of ATO in the accumulation of cells at the sub G1 phase, and the percentages of Annexin V-positive cells, respectively. Western blot data showed that ATO upregulated the expression of caspase 3, Bax, and cytochrome C, and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicate that ATO induces OS and cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells through the mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells', 'Mitochondria apoptotic pathway', 'Oxidative stress']",PMC5619256,"['G12 MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD008149/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",['Competing Interests The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.'],,,['NIHMS854122'],,,,,,,

In this study, we present optical coherence tomography and T cell neurotrophin gene analysis findings in a small number of patients with benign multiple sclerosis. Our results demonstrated that retinal nerve fiber layer was mildly thinned, and T cells had a distinct gene expression profile that included upregulation of interleukin 10 and leukemia inhibitory factor, downregulation of interleukin 6 and neurotensin high affinity receptor 1 (a novel neurotrophin receptor).

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"The clinical value of assessing immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA subclasses in addition to the isotypes of soluble Igs in serum has been well established. >20years ago, the International Union of Immunological Societies and the World Health Organization performed collaborative studies in order to validate antibody (Ab) clones for the detection of IgG and IgA subclasses for a broad range of laboratory assays, except for flow cytometry. Here we analyzed the performance of commercially available Ab clones to detect IgG and IgA subclasses in memory B-cells and plasma cells (PCs) by flow cytometry. In a first step, 28 Ab clones were evaluated in peripheral blood from healthy donors. Only 17/28 clones showed reactivity against IgG and IgA subclasses expressed on the B-cell and PC surface membrane, including Ab clones for IgG1 (SAG1, HP6188, HP6001 and HP6186), IgG2 (SAG2, HP6014 and HP6002), IgG3 (SAG3, HP6095 and HP6050), IgG4 (SAG4), IgA1 (SAA1, H69-11.4 and B3506B4) and IgA2 (SAA2, 2E2, and A9604D2). In a second step, for each Ig subclass a single clone was selected according to its specificity and fluorescence intensity (resolution power), for further more detailed validation (SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, SAG4, SAA1 and SAA2). This validation process was carried out in 4 different laboratories by testing the selected Ab clones in human peripheral blood, bone marrow and tonsil samples, using different staining protocols (e.g. surface membrane and/or cytoplasmic staining). All selected Ab clones displayed strong positivity, high specificity and optimal resolution between negative and positive cells. Alternative Ab clones were also validated.

Specific functions of JAK1 in the context of hematopoiesis, and specifically within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have not clearly been delineated. Here, we show that conditional Jak1 loss in HSCs reduces their self-renewal and markedly alters lymphoid/myeloid differentiation in vivo. Jak1-deficient HSCs exhibit decreased competitiveness in vivo and are unable to rescue hematopoiesis in the setting of myelosuppression. They exhibit increased quiescence, an inability to enter the cell cycle in response to hematopoietic stress, and a marked reduction in cytokine sensing, including in response to type I interferons and IL-3. Moreover, Jak1 loss is not fully rescued by expression of a constitutively active Jak2 allele. Together, these data highlight an essential role for Jak1 in HSC homeostasis and stress responses.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

After a century of its descriptive history, many diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications relating to this unique leukemia subset remain uncertain. The rarity of the disease and the simultaneous involvement of its associated myeloid compartment have complicated in vitro studies of human erythroleukemia cell lines. Although murine and cell line erythroleukemia models have provided valuable insights into pathophysiology, translation of these concepts into treatment are not forthcoming. Integration of knowledge gained through a careful study of these models with more recent data emerging from molecular characterization will help elucidate key mechanistic pathways and provide a much needed framework that accounts for erythroid lineage-specific attributes.

Sixteen patients received systemic corticosteroid administration before GVHD progression. The cumulative incidence of GVHD progression at 28 days from the onset of grade IIs GVHD was 24%. Twenty-five patients did not require systemic corticosteroid administration throughout the entire episode of acute GVHD. Systemic corticosteroid administration before GVHD progression did not affect GVHD progression, chronic GVHD, or non-relapse mortality. Early onset (less than 26 days from transplantation) of grade IIs GVHD was identified as the only statistically significant risk factor for GVHD progression (hazard ratio 6.73, 95% confidence interval 1.5-31.1, P = 0.01).

The pathophysiological mechanism of AML is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the crucial miRNAs and mRNAs associated with AML survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS The full clinical dataset of miRNA and mRNA expression profiling of AML patients was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to obtain those miRNAs and mRNAs associated with AML survival. A miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed. The underlying functions of mRNAs were predicted through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEEG) pathway enrichment. The expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS Fourteen miRNAs and 830 mRNAs associated with AML survival were identified. Of the 14 miRNAs, hsa-mir-425, hsa-mir-1201, and hsa-mir-1978 were identified as risk factors and the other 11 miRNAs were identified as protective factors of AML survival. For target-genes of miRNAs, GTSF1, RTN4R, and CD44 were the top risk factor target-genes associated with AML survival. An interaction network was constructed that including 607 miRNA-target gene pairs associated with AML survival. Target-genes associated with AML survival were significantly enriched in several pathways including pancreatic secretion, calcium signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and Alzheimer's disease. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with our bioinformatics analyses. CONCLUSIONS The miRNA hsa-mir-425 was identified as the top risk factor miRNA of AML survival and CD44 was identified as one of the top three risk factor target-genes associated with AML survival. Both hsa-mir-425 and CD44 may play key roles in progression and development of AML through calcium signaling pathway and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity.",,,,PMC5634225,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the HLXB9 gene in a myeloid leukaemia cell line, GDM-1, known to harbour a rearrangement involving chromosome 7 with a breakpoint distal to HLXB9, highly expressed in these cells. We used FISH to target the regions involved in the translocation and to distinguish the translocated chromosome from the non-translocated one in interphase nuclei. Two-dimensional analysis of the interphase FISH data indicated that the 2 HLXB9 alleles had a different localisation in the cell nuclei, with the translocated allele consistently positioned in the nuclear periphery and the normal one in the more internal portion of the nucleus, known as the transcriptionally active compartment. Our data may indicate that HLXB9 transcripts in the GDM-1 cell line do not arise from the allele located in rearranged chromosome 7, suggesting that regulation of gene expression in cancer cells harbouring chromosomal translocations might be more complex than previously thought, paving the path to further investigations on mechanisms of gene expression.","['(c) 2017 S.

To determine whether MSCs in myeloid neoplasms harbor distinct somatic mutations that may affect their function, we used a targeted gene sequencing panel containing 50 myeloid neoplasm-associated genes with coverage of >/=500. We compared the genetic alterations between MSCs and bone marrow hematopoietic (BM) cells from patients with acute leukemia (n=5) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n=5). Non-synonymous somatic mutations, such as DNMT3A-R882H and FLT3-D835Y, were only detected in BM cells with high allelic frequency. We found several non-synonymous genetic variants overlapping BM cells and MSCs, including TP53 and ASXL1, partially owing to the heterogenous cell fraction of MSC samples and lineage fidelity. We also found MSC-specific genetic variants with very low allelic frequency (7% to 8%), such as NF1-G2114D and NF1-G140. Further studies in large cohorts are needed to clarify the molecular properties of MSCs including age-related genetic alterations by targeted deep sequencing.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"Epigenome regulation is a critical mechanism that governs cell identity, lineage specification and developmental cell fates. With the advent of low-input and single-cell technologies as well as sophisticated cell labeling techniques, our understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis is currently undergoing dramatic changes. Increasingly, evidence suggests that the epigenome conformation acts as a critical decision-making mechanism that instructs self-renewal, differentiation and developmental fates of hematopoietic progenitor cells. When dysregulated, this leads to the evolution of disease states such as leukemia. Indeed, aberrations in DNA methylation, histone modifications and genome architecture are characteristic features of many hematopoietic neoplasms in which epigenetic enzymes are frequently mutated. Sequencing studies and characterization of the epigenetic landscape in lymphomas, leukemias and in aged healthy individuals with clonal hematopoiesis have been indispensible to identify epigenetic regulators that play a role in transformation or pre-disposition to hematopoietic malignancies. In this review, we outline the current view of the hematopoietic system and the epigenetic mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions, with a particular focus on the role of DNA methylation in this process. We will also summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying dysregulated DNA methylation in hematologic malignancies and how this contributes to our understanding of the physiological functions of epigenetic regulators in hematopoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the ingestion of a soy-whey protein blend has been shown to promote muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the ingestion of a soy-whey blended protein (BP) may improve the PEM status and muscle mass in acute leukemia patients. In total, 24 patients from the same treatment group were randomly assigned to the natural diet plus soy-whey blended protein (BP) group and the natural diet only (ND) group. Our data showed that protein and energy intake decreased significantly (P < .05) after transplantation in both groups. In the absence of the BP intervention, dramatic decreases in muscle-related indicators (i.e., anthropometric variables, muscle strength and serum protein) were observed in the majority (>50%) of the patients. However, 66% of the patients who ingested the BP before transplantation showed obvious increases in arm muscle area. The gripping power value ( big up tri, openpost-pre or big up tri, openpost-baseline) was significantly higher in the BP group than in the ND group (P < .05). The ingestion of the BP also increased the levels of serum albumin, globulin and serum total protein to different extents. Notably, the average time to stem cell engraftment was significantly shorter for patients in the BP group (12.2 +/- 2.0 days) than for patients in the ND group (15.1 +/- 2.9 days). Collectively, our data supported that soy-whey protein can improve PEM status and muscle mass in leukemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 23.,"BACKGROUND: Despite dramatically improved long term outcomes seen with all-trans retinoic acid therapy, and now arsenic trioxide, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), early mortality remains a substantial challenge. Recent data from a single center study and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry report 30day mortality rates of 26% (n=18 of 70) and 17% (n=238 of 1400), respectively. Early deaths are predominately due to hemorrhage. Patients with APL invariably have abnormal laboratory hemostasis tests. The standard of practice is to prophylactically transfuse platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate to mitigate abnormal platelet counts, PT/PTT and fibrinogen levels. Standard blood bank practice is to transfuse platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate largely without regard to ABO blood group (platelets, cryoprecipitate), and, in some centers, transfusing ABO non-identical universal donor group AB plasma. Evidence from observational studies suggests that use of ABO non-identical blood components may be associated with increased bleeding. We hypothesized that use of ABO identical blood components and saline washed transfusions (red cells and platelets) would be associated with reduced early mortality in APL by avoidance of transfusion induced hemostatic dysfunction. METHODS: This is a single center cohort study of APL patients treated in an 800 bed university community and referral hospital. Novel approaches to transfusion support, based upon randomized trials, include implementation of ABO identical platelet transfusions for all patients with acute leukemia in 1990, use of only ABO identical cryoprecipitate in 2005, and washed transfusions of red cells and platelets for all patients with acute leukemia <50years of age beginning in 2006. Plasma transfusion has always been ABO identical. Two comparison populations were recent literature reports and the New York State Cancer Registry. We characterized 30 day mortality in APL patients seen in our institution since 2000 as a convenience sample comparable to literature reports, beginning approxcimately when ATRA therapy became uniform for induction therapy. Only patients receiving their induction therapy in our hospital were included. RESULTS: Of 41 patients there were 2 early (30 day) deaths (5%; a 71-81% reduction from expected). Early mortality at 100 days was 7% (n=3). The 30 day mortality in the younger cohort <50years of age (n=16) receiving washed transfusions was 0%. Restricting the analysis to patients treated since 2006 (ABO identical transfusions, mostly washed) (n=27; mean age 43 years; median 41 years; range 12-79), the early mortality rate at 30days was 3.7%. Long-term survival (5 years) of our APL patients was similar to New York State Cancer Registry and literature reports (80-83%). DISCUSSION: APL patients supported with transfusion regimens including ABO identical blood components, with or without washing, experienced early mortality at 30 days that was strikingly improved (71% to 86% lower) compared with that reported in the recent literature (3.7% to 5% vs. 17% to 26%). If these observed low rates of early mortality are related to transfusion practices, avoidance of ABO immune complex formation, and subsequent interference with hemostasis, is a plausible contributing mechanism. These favorable results provide a rationale for randomized trials of relatively simple and inexpensive approaches to reducing early hemorrhagic mortality in APL: use of ABO identical transfusions and washing to remove supernatant plasma.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In our study, we found that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from BM of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients have defective osteogenic differentiation and on interaction with K562 CML cells, the normal MSC showed reduced osteogenic differentiation. On interaction with K562 cells or its secreted factors, MSC acquired phenotypic abnormalities and secreted high levels of IL6 through NFkappaB activation. The MSC derived secreted factors provided a survival advantage to CML cells from imatinib induced apoptosis.

The aim of this paper is to disseminate work undertaken to design and develop pedagogical practice and innovation through an eLearning resource for health care professionals caring for children and young people with cancer across the globe. The work undertaken evaluated an existing cancer course (which has been withdrawn) that was developed and delivered through the Paediatric Oncology Nurses Forum, Royal College Nursing (Nurse Educators) and Warwick University. The evaluation consisted of 26 open and closed questions relating to the previous resource and was circulated to all health and social care professionals involved directly within specialist oncology services through the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group. Questionnaires were sent out to a convenience sample of 773 health care professionals and the response rate was 14%. The findings identified that the course was predominantly accessed by nurses, but other health care professionals also found it useful. Participants highlighted several areas where they believed content could be developed or was lacking. This included areas such as palliative and end of life care, nutrition, sepsis and teenagers and young people. This feedback was then used to develop a site dedicated to the care of children and young people with cancer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Children', '*Education', '*Health professionals', '*Young people', '*eLearning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These interactions provide instructive cues that influence the production and lineage determination of different types of blood cells and maintenance of HSC quiescence. They also contribute to hematopoietic deregulation and hematological myeloid malignancies. Alterations in the BM niche are commonly observed in myeloid malignancies and contribute to the aberrant function of myelodysplastic and leukemia-initiating stem cells. In this work, we review how different components of the BM niche affect normal hematopoiesis, the molecular signals that govern this interaction, and how genetic changes in stromal cells or alterations in remodeled malignant BM niches contribute to myeloid malignancies. Understanding the intricacies between normal and malignant niches and their modulation may provide insights into developing novel therapeutics for blood disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],,,PMC6027930,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We systematically examined the effect of propofol and its combination with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CML cell lines, patient progenitor cells and mouse xenograft model. We analyzed propofol's underlying mechanism focusing on survival pathway in CML cells. RESULTS: We show that propofol alone is active in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in KBM-7, KU812 and K562 cells, and acts synergistically with imatinib or dasatinib, in in vitro cell culture system and in vivo xenograft model. In addition, propofol is more effective in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting colony formation in CML CD34 progenitor cells than normal bone marrow (NBM) counterparts. Combination of propofol and dasatinib significantly eliminates CML CD34 without affecting NBM CD34 cells. We further demonstrate that propofol suppresses phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, S6 and 4EBP1 in K562. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt significantly reverses the inhibitory effects of propofol in K562, confirm that propofol acts on CML cells via inhibition of Akt/mTOR. Interestingly, the levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-S6 are lower in cells treated with combination of propofol and imatinib than cells treated with propofol or imatinib alone, suggesting that propofol augments BCR-ABL TKI's inhibitory effect via suppressing Akt/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Our work shows that propofol can be repurposed to for CML treatment. Our findings highlight the therapeutic value of Akt/mTOR in overcoming resistance to BCR-ABL TKI treatment in CML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt/mTOR', 'Drug repurposing', 'Leukemia', 'Propofol']",PMC5622516,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the hypomethylated STAT3 involved in benzene toxicity in vitro. As 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) is one of benzene's major toxic metabolites, AHH-1 cells were treated by 1,4-BQ for 24 h with or without pretreatment of the antioxidant a-LA or the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine (5-aza). The cell viability was investigated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. ROS was determined via 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) flow cytometric assays. The level of oxidative stress marker 8-OHdG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Methylation-specific PCR was used to detect the methylation status of STAT3. Results indicated the significantly increasing expression of ROS and 8-OHdG which accompanied with STAT3 hypomethylation in 1,4-BQ-treated AHH-1 cells. alpha-LA suppressed the expression of both ROS and 8-OHdG, simultaneously reversed 1,4-BQ-induced STAT3 hypomethylation.

Here, we examined the hypothesis that ATP release followed by activation of P2X7 receptor plays a role in UVA-induced oxidative cell damage, using human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Indeed, UVA irradiation of THP-1 cells induced ATP release and activation of P2X7 receptor. Irradiated cells showed a rapid increase of both p67 (phox) in membrane fraction and intracellular ROS. Pretreatment with ecto-nucleotidase or P2X7 receptor antagonist blocked the UVA-initiated membrane translocation of p67 (phox) and ROS production. Furthermore, pretreatment with antioxidant or P2X7 receptor antagonist efficiently protected UVA-irradiated cells from caspase-dependent cell death. These findings show that autocrine signaling through release of ATP and activation of P2X7 receptor is required for UVA-induced stimulation of oxidative stress in monocytes.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP', 'Cell death', 'P2X7 receptor', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Ultraviolet A']",PMC5598242,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is biotransformed to 2-ethenyl-2-methyloxirane (IP-1,2-O) and 2-(1-methylethenyl)oxirane (IP-3,4-O), both of which can be further metabolized to 2-methyl-2,2'-bioxirane (MBO). MBO is mutagenic, but IP-1,2-O and IP-3,4-O are not. While IP-1,2-O has been reported being genotoxic, the genotoxicity of IP-3,4-O and MBO, and the cross-linking potential of MBO have not been examined. In the present study, we used the comet assay to investigate the concentration- and time-dependent genotoxicity profiles of the three metabolites and the cross-linking potential of MBO in human hepatocyte L02 cells. For the incubation time of 1 h, all metabolites showed positive concentration-dependent profiles with a potency rank order of IP-3,4-O > MBO > IP-1,2-O. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human leukemia (HL60) cells, IP-3,4-O was still more potent in inducing DNA breaks than MBO at high concentrations (>200 muM), although at low concentrations (</=200 muM) IP-3,4-O exhibited slightly lower or similar potency to MBO. Interestingly, their time-dependent genotoxicity profiles (0.5-4 h) in L02 cells were different from each other: IP-1,2-O and MBO (200 muM) exhibited negative and positive profiles, respectively, with IP-3,4-O lying in between, namely, IP-3,4-O-caused DNA breaks did not change over the exposure time. Further experiments demonstrated that hydrolysis of IP-1,2-O contributed to the negative profile and MBO induced cross-links at high concentrations and long incubation times. Collectively, the results suggested that IP-3,4-O might play a significant role in the toxicity of isoprene.",,['NOTNLM'],"['%Tail DNA, percentage of DNA in the tail', '2-(1-Methylethenyl)oxirane', '2-Ethenyl-2-methyloxirane', ""2-Methyl-2,2'-bioxirane"", 'Comet assay', 'DEB, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium"", 'DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'Genotoxicity', 'HL60, human leukemia cells', 'HepG2, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells', ""IMDM, Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium"", 'IP-1,2-O, 2-ethenyl-2-methyloxirane', 'IP-3,4-O, 2-(1-methylethenyl)oxirane', 'Isoprene', 'Isoprene metabolites', ""MBO, 2-methyl-2,2'-bioxirane"", 'MMS, methyl methanesulfonate', 'MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide', 'PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'SD, standard deviation', 'mCPBA, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid']",PMC5598284,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombocytopenia represents a common problem for patients with MDS. ranging from mild to serious bleeding events and death. To manage thrombocytopenia, the current standard treatment includes platelet transfusion, unfortunately leading to a range of side effects. Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics represent an alternative treatment option for MDS patients with thrombocytopenia. However, it remains unclear, whether TPO mimetics influence the increase of blast cells and therefore to premature progression to AML. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for patients with MDS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 2000 to August 2017), trials registries (ISRCTN, EU clinical trials register and clinicaltrials.gov) and conference proceedings. We did not apply any language restrictions. Two review authors independently screened search results, disagreements were solved by discussion. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing TPO mimetics with placebo, no further treatment or another TPO mimetic in patients with MDS of all risk groups, without gender, age or ethnicity restrictions. Additional chemotherapeutic treatment had to be equal in both arms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials, disagreements were resolved by discussion. Risk ratio (RR) was used to analyse mortality during study, transformation to AML, incidence of bleeding events, transfusion requirement, all adverse events, adverse events >= grade 3, serious adverse events and platelet response. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) have been extracted as hazard ratios, but could not be pooled as results were reported in heterogenous ways. Health-related quality of life and duration of thrombocytopenia would have been analysed as standardised mean differences, but no trial reported these outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any trial comparing one TPO mimetic versus another. We analysed six eligible trials involving 746 adult patients. All trials were reported as randomised and double-blind trials including male and female patients. Two trials compared TPO mimetics (romiplostim or eltrombopag) with placebo, one trial evaluated eltrombopag in addition to the hypomethylating agent azacitidine, two trials analysed romiplostim additionally to a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) and one trial evaluated romiplostim in addition to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide. There are more data on romiplostim (four included, completed, full-text trials) than on eltrombopag (two trials included: one full-text publication, one abstract publication). Due to small sample sizes and imbalances in baseline characteristics in three trials and premature termination of two studies, we judged the potential risk of bias of all included trials as high.Due to heterogenous reporting, we were not able to pool data for OS. Instead of that, we analysed mortality during study. There is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study for thrombopoietin mimetics compared to placebo (RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.27, N = 6 trials, 746 patients, low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether the use of TPO mimetics induces an acceleration of transformation to AML (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77, N = 5 trials, 372 patients, very low-quality evidence).Thrombopoietin mimetics probably improve the incidence of all bleeding events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). This means that in the study population, 713 out of 1000 in the placebo arm will have a bleeding event, compared to 656 of 1000 (95% CI 613 to 699) in the TPO mimetics arm. There is little or no evidence for a difference that TPO mimetics significantly diminish the rate of transfusion requirement (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, N = 4 trials, 358 patients, low-quality evidence). No studies were found that looked at quality of life or duration of thrombocytopenia.There is no evidence that patients given TPO mimetics suffer more all adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). There is uncertainty whether the number of serious adverse events decrease under therapy with TPO mimetics (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.46, N = 4 trials, 356 patients, very low-quality evidence).We identified one ongoing study and one study marked as completed (March 2015), but without publication of results for MDS patients (only results reported for AML and MDS patients together). Both studies evaluate MDS patients receiving eltrombopag in comparison to placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No trial evaluated one TPO mimetic versus another.Six trials including adult patients analysed one TPO mimetic versus placebo, sometimes combined with standard therapy in both arms. Given the uncertainty of the quality of evidence, meta-analyses show that there is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study and premature progress to AML. However, these assumptions have to be further explored. Treatment with TPO mimetics resulted in a lower number of MDS patients suffering from bleeding events.There is no evidence for a difference between study groups regarding transfusion requirement. Enlarged sample sizes and a longer follow-up of future trials should improve the estimate of safety and efficacy of TPO mimetics, moreover health-related quality of life should be evaluated. As two ongoing studies currently investigate eltrombopag (one already completed, but without published results), we are awaiting results for this drug.",,,,PMC6483680,,,,,,,,,,,,

While they generally require treatment initiation shortly after diagnosis, it is unclear whether deferring treatment in selected patients with an indolent clinical behavior affects their overall outcome. Patients and methods: In this population-based study, all patients diagnosed with MCL during 1998-2014 were identified in the British Columbia Cancer Agency Lymphoid Cancer Database. The associations between clinico-pathologic characteristics, including the expression of Ki67, SOX11, and TP53, and time to treatment (TtT) and OS were analyzed. Results: A total of 440 patients with MCL were evaluated: 365 (83%) received early treatment and 75 (17%) were observed >/=3 months. In the observation group, 54 (72%) patients had a nodal presentation, 16 (21%) a non-nodal presentation, and 5 (7%) had only gastrointestinal involvement. Characteristics associated with deferred treatment included good performance status, no B symptoms, low LDH, non-bulky disease, non-blastoid morphology, and lower Ki67 values. The median TtT in the observation group was 35 months (range 5-79), and 60 (80%) patients were observed beyond 12 months. The median OS was significantly longer in the observation group than in the early treatment group (72 versus 52.5 months, respectively, P = 0.041). In multivariable analysis, treatment decision was not associated with OS [HR 0.804 (95% CI 0.529-1.221), P = 0.306]. Conclusions: A subgroup of patients with MCL may be safely observed from diagnosis without negatively impacting their outcomes, including patients with non-nodal presentation as well as asymptomatic patients with low burden nodal presentation and a low proliferative rate.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Methods: Patients (N = 237) received 300 mg of posaconazole iv twice daily on day 1, followed by 300 mg of posaconazole iv once daily for 4-28 days. After at least 5 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive posaconazole oral suspension, 400 mg twice daily or 200 mg three times daily, to complete a 28 day treatment course. Primary PK parameters were steady-state average concentration over the dosing interval (Cavg) and posaconazole trough levels (Cmin). Results: Mean posaconazole Cmin was 1320 ng/mL (day 6) and 1297 ng/mL (day 8); steady-state Cmin was 1090 ng/mL (day 10). Mean steady-state posaconazole Cavg was 1500 ng/mL (day 10 or 14) and was similar in HSCT recipients (1560 ng/mL) and AML/MDS patients (1470 ng/mL). The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (8%), nausea (5%) and rash (5%). IFD was reported in 3/237 patients (1%; 2 proven, 1 probable). Conclusions: Intravenous posaconazole at 300 mg was well tolerated, resulted in adequate steady-state systemic exposure and was associated with a low incidence of IFD in this population at high risk.

Accordingly, cancer vaccines that reverse tumor-associated immune suppression represent a promising therapeutic avenue of investigation. We examined the potential of an allogeneic cellular vaccine to generate immune responses against MM tumor cells. The DCOne vaccine is comprised of a human myeloid leukemia cell line differentiated into a fully functional dendritic cell, expressing a range of tumor-associated antigens that are also known targets in MM. We found that the myeloma-specific antigens expressed by the DCOne vaccine can traffic via extracellular vesicles to surrounding antigen-presenting cells, thus stimulating autologous T-cell responses. Indeed, coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with MM with the DCOne vaccine resulted in the expansion of activated CD8 T cells expressing interferon-gamma and perforin, with no significant change in the percentage of CD4 T cells producing interleukin-10. Further, coculture of patient's tumor cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and DCOne induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated killing of autologous MM cells. These findings demonstrate that the allogeneic DCOne vaccine can induce T-cell activation and myeloma-specific immunity via cross presentation of antigens by native antigen-presenting cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"Progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanism for acute myeloid leukaemia is of great significance to generate new potential targets for treatment. Recent studies showed that HOXA9, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, is commonly deregulated in acute leukaemia. In this study, we elucidated the direct correlation between HoxA9 expression and progression of leukaemia using 2 different types of leukaemia cells HL-60 and MOLT-3. The HoxA9 expression level was decreased in leukaemia cells with the treatment of all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ). Downregulation of HoxA9 could impair the proliferation and promote the leukaemia cell death. HoxA9 silencing also potentiated the differentiation of leukaemia cells, and in vivo studies demonstrated that HoxA9 downregulation could interfere the tumour growth. Interestingly, HoxA9 silencing also led to the alteration in miRNA expression, mediating the promoting effect on the leukaemia cell differentiation. Therefore, this work provided a promising and potentially efficient target to leukaemia treatment, indicating that HoxA9 is likely to be an ideal candidate in the gene therapy against acute myeloid leukaemia. In this study, we elucidated the critical role of HoxA9 in the proliferation and differentiation of leukaemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of HoxA9 modulation was correlated with the clinical effect of all-trans retinoic acid and As2 O3 . Furthermore, HoxA9 also regulated the miRNA expression, controlling the leukaemia cell differentiation. Therefore, this work provided new insights into molecular mechanism underlying the leukaemia treatment, potentially putting forward a brand new target to the gene therapy against leukaemia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60', 'HoxA9', 'MOLT-3', 'differentiation', 'leukaemia', 'microRNA', 'xenograft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study showed that trans-acting transcription factor 5 (Sp5), an LIF/STAT3 downstream target, supports mESC self-renewal. However, the mechanism by which Sp5 exerts these effects remains elusive. Here, we found that Nanog is a direct target of Sp5 and mediates the self-renewal-promoting effect of Sp5 in mESCs. Overexpression of Sp5 induced Nanog expression, while knockdown or knockout of Sp5 decreased the Nanog level. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Sp5 directly bound to the Nanog promoter. Functional studies revealed that knockdown of Nanog eliminated the mESC self-renewal-promoting ability of Sp5. Finally, we demonstrated that the self-renewal-promoting function of Sp5 was largely dependent on its zinc finger domains. Taken together, our study provides unrecognized functions of Sp5 in mESCs and will expand our current understanding of the regulation of mESC pluripotency.",,,,PMC5621696,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to identify new genes and low-frequency variants influencing the susceptibility to AIC for pediatric cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the association of variants on the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip array in 83 anthracycline-treated pediatric cancer patients. In addition to single-variant association tests, we carried out a gene-based analysis to investigate the combined effects of common and low-frequency variants to chronic AIC. RESULTS: Although no single-variant showed an association with chronic AIC that was statistically significant after correction for multiple testing, we identified a novel significant association for G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) by gene-based testing, a gene with potential roles in cardiac physiology and pathology (P=7.0x10), which remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (PFDR=0.03). The greatest contribution to this observed association was made by rs12468485, a missense variant (p.Thr253Met, c.758C>T, minor allele frequency=0.04), with the T allele associated with an increased risk of chronic AIC and more severe symptomatic cardiac manifestations at low anthracycline doses. CONCLUSION: Using exome array data, we identified GPR35 as a novel susceptibility gene associated with chronic AIC in pediatric cancer patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simulation of ANC predicted a decrease after a 5-day regimen of 60 mg/m(2) with partial recovery before the next cycle, whereas the nadir of 90 mg/m(2) on the same schedule was below 100/microl. ANC following a 60 mg/m(2) 10-day regimen was predicted to be suppressed below 100/microl as long as treatment continued without recovery.

We compared the outcome of 373 patients autografted and 335 patients allografted with a 10/10 compatible unrelated donor in first molecular remission. Patients were stratified using the ELN European Leukemia Net classification. ELN favorable group: (234 auto and 70 unrelated transplants). By univariate analysis, in the auto group, the Non Relapse Mortality (NRM) was lower (3.7% versus 19%; P < 10(-4) ), Relapse Incidence (RI) higher (29% versus 17%, P < 10(-4) ), Leukemia Free Survival (LFS) identical (67% versus 64%) and Overall Survival (OS) better than in the allogeneic group (83% versus 62%; P = .008). By multivariate analysis, autologous transplantation was associated with a lower NRM (HR: 4, P = .01) and a better OS (HR: 2.08, P = .04). ELN intermediate group 1: (87 autologous and 172 unrelated transplants). By univariate analysis, in the auto group, NRM was lower (2.5% versus 11.8%; P = .03), RI higher (59% versus 18%, P < 10(-6) ), LFS lower (39% versus 70%; P < 10(-6) ) and OS lower than in the unrelated donor group (61% versus 74%; P = .005). By multivariate analysis, unrelated donor was superior to autologous transplantation for LFS (HR: 0.36, P < 10(-5)) and OS (HR: 0.53, P = .01). ELN intermediate group 2: (52 autologous and 93 unrelated donors). The outcome was identical. We conclude that good risk patients get higher benefit from autologous transplantation. Intermediate risk 2 patients have the same outcome and Intermediate risk 1 patients get higher benefit from unrelated donor transplants.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT'],,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 19.,"Despite achieving complete remission after intensive therapy, most patients with cytogenetically normal (CN) AML relapse due to the persistence of submicroscopic residual disease. In this pilot study, we hypothesized that detection of leukemia-specific mutations following consolidation treatment using a targeted parallel sequencing approach predicts relapse. We included 34 AML patients of whom diagnostic material and remission bone marrow slides after at least one cycle of consolidation were available. Isolated DNA was screened for mutations in 19 genes using an Ion Torrent sequencing platform. Furthermore, the variant allelic frequency of distinct mutations was validated by digital PCR and sequencing using a barcoding approach. Twenty-seven out of 34 patients could be analyzed for mutation clearance. We identified 68 somatic mutations at diagnosis (median, 3 mutations per patient; range 1-5) and 22 of these were still detected in 16 patients after consolidation therapy with a reliable sensitivity of 0.5% (median, 1 mutation; range 0-3). The most frequent noncleared mutations were found in DNMT3A. However, as persistence of these mutations has recently been shown to be without any impact on relapse risk, we performed survival and relapse risk analysis excluding DNMT3A mutations. Importantly, persistence of non-DNMT3A mutations was associated with a higher risk of AML relapse (7/8 pts versus 6/19 pts; P = .013) and with a shorter relapse-free survival (333 days vs. not reached; log-rank P = .0219). Detection of residual disease by routine targeted parallel sequencing proved feasible and effective as persistence of somatic mutations other than DNMT3A were prognostic for relapse in CN AML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic platelet transfusions are administered to prevent bleeding in haemato-oncological patients. However, bleeding still occurs, despite these transfusions. This practice is costly and not without risk. Better predictors of bleeding are needed, and flow cytometric evaluation of platelet function might aid the clinician in identifying patients at risk of bleeding. This evaluation can be performed within the hour and is not hampered by low platelet count. Our objective was to assess a possible correlation between bleeding and platelet function in thrombocytopenic haemato-oncological patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion was possible for admitted haemato-oncology patients aged 18 years and above. Furthermore, an expected need for platelet transfusions was necessary. Bleeding was graded according to the WHO bleeding scale. Platelet reactivity to stimulation by either adenosine diphosphate (ADP), cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP-xL), PAR1- or PAR4-activating peptide (AP) was measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A total of 114 evaluations were available from 21 consecutive patients. Platelet reactivity in response to stimulation by all four studied agonists was inversely correlated with significant bleeding. Odds ratios (OR) for bleeding were 0.28 for every unit increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.73] for ADP; 0.59 [0.40-0.87] for CRP-xL; 0.59 [0.37-0.94] for PAR1-AP; and 0.43 [0.23-0.79] for PAR4-AP. The platelet count was not correlated with bleeding (OR 0.99 [0.96-1.02]). CONCLUSION: Agonist-induced platelet reactivity was significantly correlated to bleeding. Platelet function testing could provide a basis for a personalized transfusion regimen, in which platelet transfusions are limited to those at risk of bleeding.",['(c) 2017 International Society of Blood Transfusion.'],['NOTNLM'],"['flow cytometry', 'haematology', 'haemorrhage', 'platelet function tests', 'thrombocytopenia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperleukocytosis in acute leukemia is associated with higher early mortality due to the major complications of leukostasis, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Leukapheresis remains an important modality for the management of patients with acute leukemia and hyperleukocytosis. However, the role of leukapheresis in early mortality is controversial. This study sought to evaluate the prognostic impact of leukapheresis and its beneficial effects on TLS and DIC. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a propensity score-matched study of 166 patients with acute leukemia and hyperleukocytosis admitted between 2006 and 2016. The incidence of TLS and DIC was determined using well-defined Cairo-Bishop criteria for TLS and International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria for DIC. RESULTS: Before matching, 27 of 91 patients (30%) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 32 of 75 patients (43%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) underwent leukapheresis. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for clinical disparities between the leukapheresis and without-leukapheresis groups and resulted in 22 matched pairs of patients with AML and 16 matched pairs of patients with ALL. After matching, we observed no significant difference in early mortality rates or in the incidence of TLS or DIC between the two groups of patients with AML and ALL. CONCLUSION: Although leukapheresis may rapidly reduce white blood cell counts and leukemic blasts, any positive influence of leukapheresis could not be demonstrated by an effect on survival outcome and the incidence of early complications, such as TLS and DIC. These results suggest that a routinely performed, prophylactic leukapheresis cannot be recommended.",['(c) 2017 AABB.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), MET, AXL, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and KIT, is approved for use in multiple malignancies. We assessed the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in AML, given up-regulation of multiple relevant pathways. METHODS: Adults were eligible if they were 18 years old or older with relapsed/refractory AML or if they were 70 years old or older with newly diagnosed AML but were ineligible for conventional therapy. Cabozantinib was administered in 28-day cycles, and dose escalation occurred via cohorts. A pharmacodynamic evaluation of serial plasma samples via a plasma inhibitory assay (PIA) was used to assess FLT3-inhibitory activity in FLT3-mutant cell lines. RESULTS: Among 18 patients enrolled, 5 were found to harbor FLT3/ITD mutations. Sixteen patients (89%) had relapsed/refractory AML, and most were treated with 2 or more lines of prior treatment. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were detected at the first dose level (40 mg daily), but 2 patients experienced DLTs at the next level (60 mg daily). The remaining patients were then dosed at 40 mg daily, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Additional grade 2 or higher toxicities, possibly/probably related to cabozantinib, included fatigue, nausea, transaminitis, and electrolyte imbalance. No patients had a marrow response according to formal criteria, but 4 had peripheral blast reductions; 2 of these 4 patients transiently cleared circulating blasts. One patient experienced a reduction in marrow blasts, and 1 had stable disease. The FLT3-inhibitory activity of plasma samples, as assessed with the PIA, revealed potent and sustained inhibition in FLT3/ITD and, notably, F691 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD)-mutant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib is well tolerated in AML patients at an MTD of 40 mg daily and is a potent inhibitor of FLT3/ITD- and F691 TKD-altered tyrosine kinases. Cancer 2018;124:306-14.

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During transplantation, patients undergo a period of severe neutropenia, which puts them at high risk for infectious complications. However, the impact of patient colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) on overall survival remains unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, the authors analyzed data from 264 patients with AML who underwent a first allo-HSCT between January 2006 and March 2016 at their institution. Primary endpoints were overall survival and nonrelapse-related mortality. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two of 264 patients (53.8%) were colonized by at least 1 MDRO, mainly with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis/faecium (n = 122). The characteristics of colonized patients did not differ from those of MDRO-negative patients with respect to median age (53.5 vs 53 years), cytogenetic risk according to European LeukemiaNet criteria, remission status before allo-HSCT (first or second complete remission: 55.7% vs 60.7%, respectively; active disease: 44.4% vs 39.3%, respectively), donor type, or hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI). Compared with noncolonized patients, MDRO-positive patients had an inferior probability of survival at 5 years (43.3% vs 65.5%; P = .002), primarily because of a higher cumulative incidence of nonrelapse-related mortality (33.9% vs 9.4%; P < .001). Death caused by infections occurred in 15.5% of colonized patients versus 4.9% of noncolonized patients. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse in MDRO-positive versus MDRO-negative patients (33.8% vs 42.1%, respectively; P = .798). CONCLUSIONS: The current data emphasize the importance of regular MDRO screenings and prompt further investigations into the impact of colonization with MDRO on the immune system after allo-HSCT.

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"Basophil granulocytes and mast cells are recognized for their roles in immunity and are central effectors of diverse immunological disorders. Despite their similarities, there is emerging evidence for non-redundant roles of the circulating yet scarce basophils and tissue-resident mast cells, respectively. Because of their importance in allergic pathogenesis, specific induction of apoptosis in basophils and mast cells may represent an interesting novel treatment strategy. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-3 serves as a key factor for basophil and mouse mast cell survival. Interleukin-3 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1; however, little is known how strongly these individual proteins contribute to basophil survival. Here, we were applying small molecule inhibitors called BH3 mimetics, some of which show remarkable success in cancer treatments, to neutralize the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We observed that expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins do not necessarily correlate with their respective importance for basophil survival. Whereas naive in vitro-differentiated mouse basophils efficiently died upon BCL-2 or BCL-XL inhibition, interleukin-3 priming rendered the cells highly resistant toward apoptosis, and this could only be overcome upon combined targeting of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Of note, human basophils differed from mouse basophils as they depended on BCL-2 and MCL-1, but not on BCL-XL, for their survival at steady state. On the other hand, and in contrast to mouse basophils, MCL-1 proved critical in mediating survival of interleukin-3 stimulated mouse mast cells, whereas BCL-XL seemed dispensable. Taken together, our results indicate that by choosing the right combination of BH3 mimetic compounds, basophils and mast cells can be efficiently killed, even after stimulation with potent pro-survival cytokines such as interleukin-3. Because of the tolerable side effects of BH3 mimetics, targeting basophils or mast cells for apoptosis opens interesting possibilities for novel treatment approaches.",,,,PMC5729523,,,,,,,,,,,,

MN1 is also a potent and sufficient oncogene in murine leukemia models, strongly dependent on the MEIS1/AbdB-like HOX protein complex to transform common myeloid progenitors, block myeloid differentiation, and promote leukemic stem cell self-renewal. To identify key genes and pathways underlying leukemic activity, we functionally assessed MN1 cell phenotypic heterogeneity, revealing leukemic and non-leukemic subsets. Using gene expression profiling of these subsets combined with previously published comparisons of full-length MN1 and mutants with varying leukemogenic activity, we identified candidate genes critical to leukemia. Functional analysis identified Hlf and Hoxa9 as critical to MN1 in vitro proliferation, self-renewal and impaired myeloid differentiation. Although critical to transformation, Meis1 knockdown had little impact on these properties in vitro. However, we identified Meis2 as critical to MN1-induced leukemia, with essential roles in proliferation, self-renewal, impairment of differentiation and disease progression in vitro and in vivo. Here, we provide evidence of phenotypic and functional hierarchy in MN1-induced leukemic cells, characterise contributions of Hlf, Hoxa9 and Meis1 to in vitro leukemic properties, and reveal Meis2 as a novel player in MN1-induced leukemogenesis.",,,,PMC5709755,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, midostaurin is the only approved TKI as monotherapy for aggressive systemic mastocytosis (SM), SM with associated hematological neoplasm, or mast cell leukemia displaying a KIT mutation as well as in combination with standard intensive chemotherapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Areas covered: We provide a concise review of the pharmacology, tolerability and clinical efficacy of midostaurin and emerging new treatment options for ASM and FLT3-mutated AML. Expert commentary: Currently, midostaurin is the only approved TKI in aggressive SM, SM with associated hematological neoplasm, or mast cell leukemia inducing responses including complete remissions. With regard to AML, midostaurin is the first drug to receive regulatory approval in this indication in the molecularly defined subgroup of AML with FLT3 mutations. By introduction of this new standard in AML with FLT3 mutations, the bare has been raised for future approvals of next generation FLT3 inhibitors which will be based increasingly on head to head comparisons with midostaurin.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3 mutation', 'KIT mutation', 'advanced systemic mastocytosis', 'clinical trials', 'efficacy', 'midostaurin', 'pharmacology', 'tolerability', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary metabolites were isolated by chromatographic separation and re-crystallization, and structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopic data. The cytotoxicity was determined by WST-1 assay and brine shrimp lethality bioassay, while antibacterial activity was assessed by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Two naphthoquinones, namely anhydrofusarubin (1) and methyl ether of fusarubin (2), were isolated from Cladosporium sp. The isolated compounds 1 and 2, by WST-1 assay against human leukemia cells (K-562) showed potential cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 3.97 mug/mL and 3.58 mug/mL, respectively. Initial screening of crude ethyl acetate extract and column fractions F-8 and F-10 exhibited noticeable cytotoxicity to brine shimp nauplii with LC50 values of 42.8, 1.2 and 2.1 mug/mL, respectively. Moreover, the isolated compound 2 (40 mug/disc) showed prominent activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus megaterium with an average zone of inhibition of 27 mm, 25 mm, 24 mm and 22 mm, respectively and the activities were compared with kanamycin (30 mug/disc).

ZnO chips were fabricated by precisely tuning ZnO thickness using atomic layer deposition, and their potential to release zinc ions relative to the number of deposition cycles was evaluated. ZnO chips exhibited selective cytotoxicity in human B lymphocyte Raji cells while having no effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Of importance, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the ZnO chip on the viability of Raji cells was 121.5 cycles, which was comparable to 65.7 nM of daunorubicin, an anti-cancer drug for leukemia. Molecular analysis of cells treated with ZnO chips revealed that zinc ions released from the chips increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide, which led to the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic molecules (such as HIF-1alpha, survivin, cIAP-2, claspin, p-53, and XIAP) and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Because the anti-cancer activity of ZnO chips and the mode of action were comparable to those of daunorubicin, the development and optimization of ZnO chips that gradually release zinc ions might have clinical anti-cancer potential.

In addition, RA acts as a natural morphogen in neural development. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine PML gene expression in different stages of in vitro neural differentiation of NT2 cells, and to investigate the possible role of PML in pluripotency and/or neural development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RA was used as a neural inducer for in vitro neural differentiation of NT2 cells. During this process PML mRNA and protein levels were assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) and Immunoblotting, respectively. Furthermore bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to assess PML promoter methylation in NT2 cells and NT2 derived neuronal precursor cells (NT2.NPCs). RESULTS: QRT-PCR results showed that, PML had maximum expression with significant differences in NT2 derived neuronal precursor cells relative to NT2 cells and NT2 derived neural cells (NT2.NCs). Numerous isoforms of PML with different intensities appeared in immunoblots of pluripotent NT2 cells, NT2.NPCs, and NT2.NCs. Furthermore, the methylation of the PML promoter in NT2.NCs was 2.6 percent lower than NT2 cell. CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences in PML expression in different cellular stages possibly could be attributed to the fact that PML in each developmental state might be involved in different cell signaling machinery and different functions.

The high complexity and diversity of the AIRR coupled with the limited amount of starting material, which can compromise identification of the full biological diversity makes such sequencing particularly challenging. AIRR sequencing protocols often fail to fully capture the sampled AIRR diversity, especially for samples containing restricted numbers of B lymphocytes. Here, we describe a library preparation method for immunoglobulin sequencing that results in an exhaustive full-length repertoire where virtually every sampled B-cell is sequenced. This maximizes the likelihood of identifying and quantifying the entire IGHV-D-J repertoire of a sample, including the detection of rearrangements present in only one cell in the starting population. The methodology establishes the importance of circumventing genetic material dilution in the preamplification phases and incorporates the use of certain described concepts: (1) balancing the starting material amount and depth of sequencing, (2) avoiding IGHV gene-specific amplification, and (3) using Unique Molecular Identifier. Together, this methodology is highly efficient, in particular for detecting rare rearrangements in the sampled population and when only a limited amount of starting material is available.",,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'Illumina Miseq sequencing', 'VDJ rearrangement', 'cDNA library', 'immunoglobulin repertoire', 'next generation sequencing', 'unique molecular identifier']",PMC5603803,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) as a genomic modulator was demonstrated through pathogen-related NF-kappaB signal in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1), hepatoma (HCV), and Burkitt lymphoma (EBV). METHODS: To elucidate the relation of aberrant AID expression in MCPyV-positive and -negative MCCs, we evaluated immunohistochemical expressions of AID and AID-regulating factors between 24 MCPyV-positive and 17 MCPyV-negative MCCs. RESULTS: AID expression was significantly higher in MCPyV-negative MCCs than MCPyV-positive ones (P = 0.026), although expression of NF-kappaB p65 (phospho S536) (AID-enhancer) was significantly higher in MCPyV-positive MCCs than MCPyV-negative ones (P = 0.034). Expressions of PAX5 and c-Myb were not significantly different between these subgroups. Expressions of AID and AID-regulating factors were not correlated to prognosis of MCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that although pathogen-induced AID expression through upregulation of NF-kappaB may be relevant to carcinogenesis of MCPyV-positive MCCs, the significantly higher aberrant AID expression in MCPyV-negative MCCs is consistent with the fact that MCPyV-negative MCCs have an extremely higher mutation burden than MCPyV-positive ones.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Merkel cell carcinoma', '*Merkel cell polyomavirus', '*activation-induced cytidine deaminase']",PMC5611468,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown a link between inflammation and cancer development. However, there are few studies regarding the correlation between Behcet disease (BD) and cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the overall cancer risk and risk for specific cancers in patients with BD. METHODS: Patients with BD (n = 14,137; mean age, 44.2 +/- 12.5 years; male patients, 32.4%) without known previous cancer were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Database between 2007 and 2014. An age- and sex-matched control population of individuals without BD was randomly sampled at a ratio of 10:1. Both cohorts were followed for incident cancer until 2015. RESULTS: Overall, cancer was newly diagnosed in 451 patients with BD (3.19%) and 3975 controls (2.81%) during the follow-up period. Patients with BD showed a significantly higher risk for cancer compared with the controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.134; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.029-1.25), leukemia (HR, 5.801; 95% CI, 3.24-10.385), lymphoma (HR, 2.584; 95% CI, 1.559-4.283), oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer (HR, 2.113; 95% CI, 1.102-4.052), thyroid cancer (HR, 1.256; 95% CI, 1.05-1.501), and prostate cancer (HR, 1.784; 95% CI, 1.141-2.791). LIMITATIONS: The treatment or severity of diseases in each individual was not examined. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BD had a higher risk for overall cancer compared with controls without BD.

Further, there are few consensus guidelines or algorithms for use in these conditions. Rapid development of new therapies targeting B-cell signaling and survival pathways and increased use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy will likely result in more acquired deficiencies of humoral immunity and infections in persons with cancer.

Hypoxic conditions did not change the expression of phenotypic markers and increased adipogenesis and chondrogenesis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), TGF-beta RII, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were upregulated in the conditioned medium of hypoxic hUCB-MSCs, which are commonly related to angiogenesis and proliferation of biological processes by Gene Ontology. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, significant enrichment of the phosphorylation of abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) (Phospho-Tyr204) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL) (Phospho-Thr47) as anti-apoptotic pathways was observed in hypoxic hUCB-MSCs. Furthermore, hypoxic conditions induced proliferation and migration, and reduced apoptosis of hUCB-MSCs in vitro. Based on the results of protein antibody array, we evaluated the angiogenic effects of injecting normoxic or hypoxic hUCB-MSCs (1x10(6)) into the ischemic hindlimb muscles of mice. Ischemic scores and capillary generation were significantly greater in the hypoxic hUCB-MSC injection group than in the normoxic hUCB-MSC group. Our findings demonstrate that culturing hUCB-MSCs in hypoxic conditions not only significantly enriches phosphorylation in the anti-apoptosis pathway and enhances the secretion of several angiogenic proteins from cells, but also alleviates ischemic injury of hindlimb of mice.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients were eligible if they had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; were aged 18 years or older; had been treated with two lines of therapy (with at least a partial response after second-line therapy); had received a purine analogue, bendamustine, anti-CD20 antibody, chlorambucil, or alemtuzumab as first-line or second-line treatment; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0-2. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice-response system to receive either oral lenalidomide (2.5 mg/day) or matching oral placebo capsules (2.5 mg/day) for 28-day cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lenalidomide dose escalation (to 5 mg or 10 mg per day) was permitted if the drug was well tolerated. Patients, investigators, and those completing data analyses were masked to treatment allocation. Randomisation was stratified by age, response to second-line therapy, and prognostic factors. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival; the primary endpoint was later changed to overall survival after the data cutoff for this analysis. Secondary endpoints were time from randomisation to second disease progression or death (PFS2),(32) tumour response (improvement in response and duration of response), safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00774345, and is closed to accrual, but follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16, 2009 and Sept 29, 2015, 314 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either lenalidomide (n=160) or placebo (n=154). With a median follow-up of 31.5 months (IQR 18.9-50.8), there was no significant difference in overall survival between the lenalidomide and the placebo groups (median 70.4 months, 95% CI 57.5-not estimable [NE] vs NE, 95% CI 62.8-NE; hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.63-1.48; p=0.86). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the lenalidomide group (median 33.9 months, 95% CI 25.5-52.5) than in the placebo group (9.2 months, 7.4-13.6; HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29-0.55; p<0.0001). PFS2 was significantly longer in the lenalidomide group than in the placebo group (median 57.5 months [47.7-NE] vs 32.7 months [26.4-49.0]; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.70; p<0.01). Improved responses from baseline were observed in ten (6%) of 160 lenalidomide-treated patients versus four (3%) of 154 placebo-treated patients (p=0.12). Median time to improved response was 12.2 weeks (IQR 7.2-22.5) in the lenalidomide group versus 76.3 weeks (20.2-182.6) in the placebo group. Duration of improved response was not estimable in either group (95% CI 22.9-NE in the lenalidomide group vs NE-NE for placebo). There were no clinically meaningful differences in HRQoL between lenalidomide-treated patients and placebo-treated patients, as measured by FACT-Leu and EQ-5D, during maintenance treatment. In the safety population, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (94 [60%] of 157 patients in the lenalidomide group vs 35 [23%] of 154 patients in the placebo group), thrombocytopenia (26 [17%] vs ten [6%]), and diarrhoea (13 [8%] vs one [<1%]). There were five fatal adverse events (three [2%] patients in the lenalidomide group and two [1%] patients in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Lenalidomide might delay time to subsequent therapy and does not adversely affect response to subsequent therapy. Chemoimmunotherapy followed by lenalidomide maintenance could be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who do not have access to kinase inhibitors.

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Genomic analysis of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has identified that mutations within genes encoding RNA splicing factors represent the most common class of genetic alterations in MDS. These mutations primarily affect SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. Current data suggest that these mutations perturb RNA splicing catalysis in a manner distinct from loss of function but how exactly the global changes in RNA splicing imparted by these mutations result in MDS is not well delineated. At the same time, cells bearing mutations in RNA splicing factors are exquisitely dependent on the presence of the remaining wild-type (WT) allele to maintain residual normal splicing for cell survival. The high frequency of these mutations in MDS, combined with their mutual exclusivity and noteworthy dependence on the WT allele, make targeting RNA splicing attractive in MDS. To this end, two promising therapeutic approaches targeting RNA splicing are being tested clinically currently. These include molecules targeting core RNA splicing catalysis by interfering with the ability of the SF3b complex to interact with RNA, as well as molecules degrading the auxiliary RNA splicing factor RBM39. The preclinical and clinical evaluation of these compounds are discussed here in addition to their potential as therapies for spliceosomal mutant MDS.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine are approved for use in the United States and in Europe for the treatment of MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and, in the case of azacitidine, prolong survival in higher-risk patients. Neither is curative, though, and given the lack of clear treatment guidelines after HMA treatment failure, it is imperative to optimize patient selection and identify the right timing of HMA treatment initiation and response evaluation to maximize patient benefit. Initiatives to improve outcomes have focused on HMA-based drug combinations to enhance HMA activity or treat MDS using complementary drug mechanisms of action.

LACHA-DOX had a size of ca. 183 nm and a DOX loading content of ca. 12.0 wt.%. MTT and flow cytometry assays showed that LACHA-DOX possessed a high targetability and antitumor activity toward CD44 receptor overexpressing LP-1 human MM cells and AML-2 human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The in vivo and ex vivo images revealed that LACHA-DOX achieved a significantly enhanced accumulation in LP-1 and AML-2 tumor xenografts. Notably, LACHA-DOX effectively suppressed LP-1 as well as AML-2 tumor growth and drastically increased mice survival rate as compared to control groups receiving free DOX or PBS. Histological analyses exhibited that LACHA-DOX caused little damage to the major organs like liver and heart.

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is often associated with negative psychosocial consequences not only for patients but also for their partners. These consequences are also influenced by the applied coping strategies. OBJECTIVE: The study examines the influence of Dyadic Coping (DC) on social support and psychological distress (symptoms of depression and anxiety) in haemato-oncological patients and their partners. Of particular interest is the significance of dyadic accordance (conformity) of the assessment of DC (""discrepancy indexes""). METHODS: The study investigates 330 couples (haemato-oncological patients and their partners, average age patient 57.0 years, 63.3 percent male, 25.8 percent acute leukemia). In addition to Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI), standardized instruments are used. Research data is being analyzed with t-tests, partial correlation and regression. RESULTS: Patients and partners use similar dyadic coping strategies, whereby partners assess coping behaviors of patients more accurately than vice versa. Regarding social support, the DC total score plays a more decisive role than discrepancy indexes, in particular with patients (R(2)=20.4%). Conversely, discrepancy indexes explain a large part of the patients' variance (R(2)=10.2%); regarding psychological stress, the DC total score shows no effects in this model. DISCUSSION: The results demonstrate the relevance of the DC discrepancy indexes as a measure for interpersonal accordance for psychosocial outcomes, especially for psychological distress. Further application-related research is necessary to generate reliable statements about these associations.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Incorporation of AraC into DNA activates checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), leading to cell-cycle arrest and diminished AraC cytotoxicity, which can be reversed by the selective Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776. Building on a Phase I trial, we conducted a phase II trial comparing timed sequential AraC with or without MK-8776. METHODS: Patients with relapsed or primary refractory AML were randomized 1:1 to receive either AraC with MK-8776 (Arm A); or AraC alone (Arm B). RESULTS: 32 patients were treated: 14 assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B. There were 5 (36%) complete responses (CR/CRi) and 1 (7%) partial response (PR) in Arm A, and 8 (44%) CR/CRis and 1 (6%) PR in Arm B. Median survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (5.9months in Arm A vs. 4.5 months in Arm B). MK-8776 led to a robust increase in DNA damage in circulating leukemic blasts as measured by increased gamma-H2AX (16.9%+/-6.1% prior and 36.4%+/-6.8% at one hour after MK-8776 infusion, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: Response rates and survival were similar between the two groups in spite of evidence that MK-8776 augmented DNA damage in circulating leukemic blasts. Better than expected results in the control arm using timed sequential AraC and truncated patient enrollment may have limited the ability to detect clinical benefit from the combination.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, IFN-omega has been explored as a treatment option for some diseases or viral infections in humans and other animals. Studies have revealed that human IFN-omega displays antitumor activities in some models of human cancer cells and that it can be used to diagnose some diseases. While recombinant feline IFN-omega has been licensed in several countries for treating canine parvovirus, feline leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, it also exhibits a certain efficacy when used to treat other viral infections or diseases. This review examines the known biological activity of IFN-omega and its clinical applications.

Epub 2017 Sep 28.,"The acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a rare disease, affecting 0.1/100,000 individuals globally. Despite significant advances in APL therapy, some patients still experience relapsed disease. Currently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was found to be effective in relapsed APL treatment and considered as standard treatment for these cases. However, it has been shown that exposure to As2O3 may exert adverse effects on the male reproductive system since this substance might also induce apoptosis of other important cell types including stem cells. Studies demonstrated that treatment with this metallic substance decreased plasma levels of testosterone and interfered with sperm parameters such as concentration, motility, and viability. In addition, As2O3 was found to produce significant damage to spermatocytes, which may be associated with testicular toxicity and consequent inhibition of spermatogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine sub-chronic treatment effects of As2O3 on sperm and testicular morphology, androgen receptor (AR) immunoreactivity in testes and epididymis, in addition to evaluation of fertility parameters in adult male mice. Thirty adult Swiss mice were divided into three experimental groups: control; received distilled water (vehicle) while treated received 0.3 or 3 mg/kg/day As2O3 subcutaneously, for 5 days per week, followed by 2 days of interruption, for 5 weeks. Results showed that As2O3 (1) decreased spermatozoa number, (2) produced seminiferous epithelium degeneration and exfoliation of germ cells tubule lumen (3) altered nucleus/cytoplasm proportion of Leydig cells and (4) reduced AR immunoreactivity in both Leydig and epithelial epididymal cells. Further, fetal viability tests demonstrated an increase in post-implantation loss in females that were mated with As2O3-treated males. Data indicate that As2O3 exposure altered the spermatogenic process and subsequently fetal viability.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arsenic trioxide', '*androgen receptor', '*post-implantation loss', '*sperm malformation', '*toxicology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at detecting the presence of BLV DNA in raw beef and fresh milk for human consumption. Nested PCR directed at the BLV gag gene (272 bp) was used as a diagnostic test. PCR products were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Forty-nine per cent of the samples proved positive for the presence of proviral DNA. This is the first study highlighting the presence of the BLV gag gene in meat products for human consumption and confirms the presence of the viral DNA in raw milk, as in previous reports.

Kefir is fermented milk with Caucasian and Tibet origin, made from the incubation of kefir grains with raw milk or water. Kefir grains are a mixture of yeast and bacteria, living in a symbiotic association. Antibacterial, antifungal, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects are some of the health beneficial properties of kefir grains. Furthermore, it is suggested that some of the bioactive compounds of kefir such as polysaccharides and peptides have great potential for inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells.

The assay included a protein shuttling between different cellular compartments and a site-specific recombinant protease. The shuttle protein used was the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein tandemly fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the red fluorescent protein (RFP), while the protease was the site-specific protease VP24 from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The fluorescent proteins in the Rev fusion protein were separated by a cleavage site specific for the VP24 protease. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells proteolysis was observed by fluorescence microscopy as a shift from a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein RevEGFP to a nuclear localization while the RFP part of the fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm. The cleavage of the fusion protein by VP24 was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The activity of VP24, when tagged N-terminally by the Myc-epitope, was found to be comparable to VP24.

Rex is a neucleo-cytoplasmic shuffling protein of Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1(HTLV-1)which has important role in active transport of cargo-containing RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in the disease development by the virus. In spite of its importance, the 3d-structurephosphorylated and unphosphorylated of this protein has not been determined. In this study, first we predicted whether Rex protein is an ordered or disordered protein. In second step protein 3Dstructure of Rex was obtained. The content of disorder-promoting amino acids, flexibility, hydrophobicity, short linear motifs (SLiMs) and protein binding regions and probability of Rex crystallization were calculated by various In Silico methods. The3D models of Rex protein were obtained by various In Silico methods, such as homology modeling, threading and ab initio, including; I-TASSER, LOMETS, SPARSKS, ROBBETA and QUARK servers. By comparing and analyzing Qmean, z-scores and energy levels of selected models, the best structures with highest favored region in Ramachandran plot (higher than 90%) was refined with MODREFINER software. In silico analysis of Rex physicochemical properties and also predicted SLiMs and binding regions sites confirms that unphosphorylated Rex protein in HTLV-1 as Rev protin in HIV is wholly disordered protein belongs to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins with extended disorder (native coils, native pre-molten globules).",,['NOTNLM'],"['3D model', 'Disordered proteins', 'HTLV-1', 'Rex protein']",PMC5613702,,,,,,,,,,,,

E6.1 Jurkat cells, which lack endogenous CD44 expression, were engineered to express CD44. Previously we showed that Akt is hypophosphorylated, EGR-1 expression is reduced and proliferation is impaired in CD44 expressing E6.1 Jurkat cells. The cell cycle was studied using flow cytometry and the role of calcium (Ca(2+)) in Akt phosphorylation and EGR-1 expression was investigated using Western blotting. Phosphatase activity was assessed using a commercially available kit. CD44 expressing cells showed disruption at the G1 to S transition. Chelation of Ca(2+) from the culture media impaired Akt phosphorylation and EGR-1 expression in both CD44 expressing cells and the open vector control. Moreover, Ni(2+) disrupted cell proliferation in both cell types suggesting Ca(2+) import through calcium release activated calcium channels (CRAC). Staining of cells with fura-2 AM showed significantly higher Ca(2+) in CD44 expressing cells as compared with the vehicle control. Finally, non-calcium mediated phosphatase activity was significantly greater in CD44 expressing cells. We propose that the enhanced phosphatase activity in the CD44 cells increased the dephosphorylation rate of Akt; at the same time, the increased intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) in the CD44 cells ensured that the phosphorylation of Akt remains intact albeit at lower concentrations as compared with the vector control. Reduced Akt phosphorylation resulted in lowered expression of EGR-1 and hence, reduced the cell proliferation rate.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'CD44', 'Calcium', 'Jurkat', 'Proliferation']",PMC5600419,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical examination revealed low body condition score (1.75/5), pallor and bilateral basilar grade II/VI systolic heart murmur. Neurological examination revealed hindlimb ataxia, severe atrophy of the hindlimb musculature, intermittent hindlimb proprioceptive deficits and normoreflexia. Clinicopathological investigations revealed non-regenerative anaemia (haematocrit 0.17 l/l; reference interval [RI] 0.24-0.45 l/l) and increased feline pancreatic lipase concentration (Spec fPL test [IDEXX] 8.3 mug/l; RI 0.1-3.5 mug/l). Feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibody tests were negative. Thoracic and abdominal imaging revealed a soft tissue structure in the area of the thoracoabdominal aorta. CT confirmed a periaortic contrast-enhancing mass extending from the level of T9-L2, with associated intervertebral infiltration at the level of T11-T12. Post-mortem examination confirmed the presence of a solid, white, multinodular, well-demarcated mass encircling the aorta extending from T9-L2. Based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry, a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma was made. Lymphoma was also identified histopathologically within the kidneys and spleen. Evidence of mild Wallerian degeneration was present within the spinal cord, indicating compression at the level of the periaortic mass.

Emerging evidence supports the supposition that excessive production of interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), a critical inflammatory cytokine, leads to immune dysfunction and disease progression in HIV infection. In this study, we sought to elucidate the cause of the upregulated production of IP-10 in HIV infection and explore the underlying mechanisms. Bolstering miR-21 levels using mimics resulted in the obvious suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IP-10 in monocyte leukemia cells THP-1 and vice versa. The analysis of the primary monocytes of HIV patients revealed significantly less miR-21 than in healthy controls; this was opposite to the tendency of IP-10 levels in plasma. The secretion of IP-10 due to LPS stimulation was not affected by miR-21 modulation in the differentiated THP-1 macrophages (THP-1-MA). We found a novel switch, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), which triggers the expression of IP-10 and is significantly upregulated during the differentiation of THP-1 into THP-1-MA. The inhibition of ISG15 can restore the regulation of IP-10 by miR-21. In summary, IP-10 expression in monocytes is regulated by miR-21, whereas in macrophages, this fine-tuning is attenuated by the enhanced expression of ISG15. This study paves the way to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism of IP-10, a key point in immune intervention strategy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV infection', 'IFN-stimulated gene 15', 'inflammatory response', 'interferon-inducible protein 10', 'microRNA-21']",PMC5601991,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excessive anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists is the most common aetiology. We report the case of a large acute jejunal intramural hematoma in a patient with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia receiving chemotherapy and nilotinib. The patient presented with abdominal pain, haematochezia, acute anaemia and thrombocytopenia. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed SISBH. The patient was managed conservatively with supportive management and cessation of nilotinib therapy. The patient's symptoms improved, with subsequent CT imaging confirming resolution. This case highlights an uncommon cause of gastrointestinal bleed usually diagnosed only after radiological imaging. A correct diagnosis is important as SISBH usually responds to conservative measures, and may obviate the patient from unnecessary invasive investigations.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)', '2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 27.,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease characterized by lipid accumulation and endothelial dysfunction. Cytoglobin has been shown to exert protective effects under oxidative stress conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCYGB) has protective effects against atherosclerosis. We intraperitoneally injected rhCYGB (0, 4, or 7 mg/kg BW) into the atherosclerotic rats daily for 60 days. The rhCYGB injections reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner, rhCYGB (7 mg/kg) significantly attenuated atherosclerosis. Blood proteins were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the majority of the proteins in question were participated in oxidative stress pathways and cardiovascular diseases. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells were treated with oleic acid (0.3 mmol/L), and Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells were incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL; 50 microg/mL) to induce foam cell (FC) formation in vitro. Treatment with different concentrations of rhCYGB (0, 5, 10, and 15 mug/mL) significantly decreased the lipid droplet levels in HepG2 cells and cholesterol ester levels in FCs. Moreover, rhCYGB significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity and decreased malondialdehyde and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity in cells. In addition, rhCYGB decreased NO and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in FCs by functioning as an NO dioxygenase enzyme and ROS scavenger. Taken together, our findings indicate that rhCYGB prevented atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. Our study provides insights into the possible usefulness of rhCYGB as an antiatherosclerosis agent.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*atherosclerosis', '*lipid metabolism', '*oxidative stress', '*proteomics', '*rhCYGB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The effect of 17-AAG on proliferation of ATL cell lines HUT-102 was assessed using CCK8 at different time points. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The specific proteins HSP90, STAT5, p-STAT5 and JAK3 were detected by Western blotting. Results: Overexpression of HSP90 in HUT-102 cell lines was disclosed (P<0.05) , and constitutive activation of JAK3/STAT5 signaling was observed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines but not in normal PBMCs; Treatment of ATL cell lines with 17-AAG led to reduced cell proliferation, but there was no significant change in terms of cell proliferation when the concentration of 17-AAG between 2 000-8 000 nmol/L (P>0.05) . 17-AAG induced cell apoptosis in different time-points and concentrations. 17-AAG don't affect the expression of JAK3 gene.

Methods: Quantitative assessment of bone marrow WT1 mRNA level was preformed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) assay. The expression levels of WT1 dynamically measured with RQ-RT-PCR were retrospectively analyzed in 121 AML cases (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia) achieving complete remission (CR) after induction therapy followed by consolidation therapy. By comparing WT1 levels of patients with different post-therapy outcomes, the investigators used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine WT1 threshold so as to predict their clinical relapses. Then prognoses and the significance of intervention were analyzed between WT1 positive and negative patients according to the cut-off value of WT1. Results: According to ROC curve, WT1 level higher than 2.98% predicted the possibility of relapse. For simplicity and clinical application, 3.00% was used as the cut-off value of WT1 level for relapse. WT1 levels in 41 patients at diagnosis were detected, meanwhile 3 patients whose WT1 levels at diagnosis below 3.00% were excluded, then the median WT1 level of the rest 38 patients at diagnosis was 44.09% (range 7.19%-188.06%) . The median WT1 level in remission was 0.48% (352 samples, range 0-8.41%) . The median WT1 level at diagnosis was higher than that in remission. Excluding the 3 patients with WT1 level at diagnosis under 3.00%, the relapse rate of WT1 positive group (>3.00% during consolidation phase and follow-up) and WT1 negative group (</=3.00%) was 70.0% (14/20) and 12.2% (12/98) respectively (P<0.001) . The median time from WT1 positivity to clinical relapse was 58 days. Conclusions: WT1 expression level above 3.00% was associated with markedly high risk of relapse, which could be as a useful marker for monitoring MRD following consolidation therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Relapse', ""Wilms'tumor gene 1""]",PMC7348239,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Of 13 enrolled ALL cases, the ETV6-RUNX1 expression of 7 patients converted to positive after transplant at a median time of 137 days (range, 28-270 days) . The expression level of the first positive sample was 0.034% (range, 0.004%-0.061%) . The duration from ETV6-RUNX1 positive to hematological relapse was 196 days (range, 28-666 days) . Four patients experienced relapse at a median time of 294 days (range, 104-803 days) after allo-HSCT. The ETV6-RUNX1 expression converted to positive prior to MRD. Patients with positive ETV6-RUNX1 gene expression pre-transplantation would be more likely to relapse. Conclusion: Monitoring ETV6-RUNX1 by RQ-PCR could be used to evaluate MRD status after allo-HSCT. Patients with positive ETV6-RUNX1 after transplant had a poor prognosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Fusion gene, ETV6-RUNX1', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Leukemia, lymphocytic, acute', 'Minimal residual disease']",PMC7348250,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that adult HSCs are hypersensitive to LD irradiation. This hyper-radiosensitivity is dependent on an immediate increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that also promotes autophagy and activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Nrf2 activation initially protects HSCs from the detrimental effects of ROS, but protection is transient, and increased ROS levels return, promoting a long-term decrease in HSC self-renewal. In vivo, LD total body irradiation (TBI) does not decrease HSC numbers unless the HSC microenvironment is altered by an inflammatory insult. Paradoxically, such an insult, in the form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) preconditioning, followed by LD-TBI facilitates efficient bone marrow transplantation without myeloablation. Thus, LD irradiation has long-term detrimental effects on HSCs that may result in hematological malignancies, but LD-TBI may open avenues to facilitate autologous bone marrow transplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Among them, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) mutations belonging to the RNA splicing pathway were of interest. Many studies have already reported the potential prognostic value of SRSF2 mutations in MDS patients, with controversial results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate their prognostic impact on MDS. METHODS: Databases, including PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library, were searched for relevant studies published up to 14 October 2016. Overall survival (OS) was selected as the primary endpoint, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation was the secondary endpoint. We extracted the corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS and AML transformation from multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. The combined HRs with their 95% CIs were calculated using fixed or random effect models. RESULTS: A total of 10 cohort studies, covering 1864 patients with de novo MDS and 294 patients with SRSF2 mutations, were included in the final meta-analysis. Our results indicated that SRSF2 mutations had an adverse prognostic impact on OS (p<0.0001) and AML transformation (p = 0.0005) in the total population. Among the MDS patients with low or intermediate-1 risk defined according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), SRSF2 mutations predicted a shorter OS (p = 0.009) and were more likely to transform to AML (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates an independent, adverse prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutations on OS and AML transformation in patients with de novo MDS. This also applies to the subgroup of low- or intermediate-1-IPSS risk MDS. The identification of mutations in SRSF2 can improve current risk stratification and help make treatment decisions.",,,,PMC5617234,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) murine model for MDS to study HSCT in a pre-clinical setting. NHD13 recipients transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow (S-HSCT) following myeloablative irradiation showed disease remission, with normalization of peripheral blood parameters and marked decrease in circulating leukocytes derived from the MDS clone. Despite the disease remission and improved survival compared to non-transplanted NHD13 controls, all mice eventually relapsed, indicating persistence of a long-lived radio-resistant MDS clone. In an effort to induce a graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect, A-HSCT with donor bone marrow that was mismatched at minor histocompatibility loci was compared to S-HSCT. Although recipients in the A-HSCT showed a lower early relapse rate than in S-HSCT, all mice in both groups eventually relapsed and died by 54 weeks post-transplant. To obtain a more significant GVL effect, donor splenocytes containing reactive T-cells were transplanted with allogeneic bone marrow. Although the relapse rate was only 20% at post-transplantation week 38, suggesting a GVL effect, this was accompanied by a severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) Taken together, these findings indicate that a myeloablative dose of ionizing radiation is insufficient to eradicate the MDS initiating cell, and that transplantation of donor splenocytes leads to decreased relapse rates, at the cost of severe GVHD. We suggest that NHD13 mice represent a feasible pre-clinical model for the study of HSCT for MDS.",,,,PMC5617185,"['Z01 BC010983/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA SC010378/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This article aimed to estimate the cancer incidence and the trend in standardized cancer incidence in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, South China during 2001-2015 by analyzing the cancer data of the population-based cancer registry in Shenzhen. Data were collected from the cancer registry in Shenzhen, which was conducted during 2001-2015. In this registry, the crude incidence rates, age-specific incidence rates, age-standardized incidence rates and cumulative incidence rates were calculated in every five years. Trends for standardized incidence rates of cancers were analyzed by using the joinpoint regression analysis. In total, 33,374.3 thousand person-years (17,593.9 thousand for males and 15,780.4 thousand for females) were monitored over this time period. The number of new cancer cases during 2001-2015 was 59,218 (30,144 and 29,074 for males and females, respectively). The crude incidence during 2001-2005 was 136.44 per 100,000 persons, while the age-standardized rates by Chinese standard population (ASR-China) and by world standard population (ASR-world) were 165.13 and 212.48 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The crude incidence during 2006-2010 was 179.01 per 100,000 persons, while the ASR-China and ASR-world were 168.08 and 214.44 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The crude incidence during 2011-2015 was 196.53 per 100,000 persons, while the ASR-China and ASR-world were 171.44 and 219.99 per 100,000 persons, respectively. During 2001 and 2015, the joinpoint regression analysis showed that the ASR-China of cancer had an overall increase of 0.96% per year and 0.84% per year for males and females respectively, although both of these values (males and females) were non-significant increases. The leading cancer types during 2011-2015 were lung, colorectal, thyroid gland, breast, liver, stomach, cervix, nasopharynx, leukemia and lymphoma. For males, the top five common cancers were lung, liver, colorectal, stomach and thyroid gland. For females, the top five common cancers were breast, thyroid gland, lung, colorectal and cervix. The results of this study showed a heavy cancer burden among the population of Shenzhen, China. Future researches of the etiology and prevention of cancers should be planned in order to reduce the incidence associated with cancers in the future.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Shenzhen', '*cancer registry', '*epidemiology', '*incidence', '*malignancy']",PMC5664638,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Rarely, neutrophilic panniculitis may be induced by chemotherapeutics or targeted molecular therapies, including the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Previously reported cases of ibrutinib-induced panniculitis were suppressed with sustained low-dose steroid therapy while continuing ibrutinib therapy. To our knowledge, self-limiting panniculitis during ibrutinib therapy has not yet been described. We describe a case of self-limiting, neutrophilic panniculitis which developed during ibrutinib therapy. A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 3-week history of painful erythematous nodules on her lower extremities which occurred 1 month after initiating ibrutinib therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Physical examination revealed tender erythematous poorly demarcated subcutaneous nodules on the anterior and posterior aspects of both lower legs. A panniculitis was suspected clinically, and a punch biopsy was performed. Histological evaluation revealed a lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis and infiltrates consisting predominantly of neutrophils. A diagnosis of neutrophilic panniculitis was rendered, which the patient opted not to treat.

It suppresses the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and also plays an important role in promoting survival and drug resistance in leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Since the role of OPN isoforms in AML angiogenesis are remaining controversial, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether curcumin (CUR), as a known natural component with anti-angiogenesis effects, in a combination of AML conventional regiment has the potency to preclude induced anti-angiogenesis effects of OPN isoforms or not? Leukemia cells were treated with different concentration of CUR and AML conventional drugs alone and/or in combination with together to find effective doses and IC50 values. Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin/PI staining and mRNA levels of OPN isoforms and AKT/ VEGF-A and VEGF-C/ STAT3/ beta-catenin/ CXCR4/ IL-6/ KDR gene expression were investigated by Real Time-PCR method. Moreover, to confirm OPN gene expression data, we investigated the effect of simvastatin and OPN siRNA as an OPN inhibitor on the cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the indicated cell lines. Our data display that Ara-c (2muM and 1muM in KG-1 and U937 cell lines respectively), CUR (40muM in both cell lines), and also their combination significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Moreover, the mRNA level of OPN isoforms were down regulated in the KG-1and U937 cell lines treated with Ara-c while, upregulated in KG-1and U937 cell lines treated with CUR and its combination. Our results suggest that despite anti-angiogenesis effects of CUR, AML cells probably evade from anti-angiogenesis effects of CUR via induction of OPN b and c isoform and related molecular pathways.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Osteopontin', '*anti-angiogenesis', '*chemoresistance', '*acute myeloid leukemia']",PMC5720671,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study design and setting: A retrospective chart review study was conducted at An-Najah National University Hospital (NNUH) during the period of January, 2014 to December, 2016. Methodology: The medical records of AML patients treated at NNUH were reviewed. All patients at least 16 years of age diagnosed with de novo AML and started on induction chemotherapy were included. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data. Results: Out of 88 patients diagnosed with AML during the study period, 64 had de novo AML and were included. Median age at diagnosis was 36 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.13:1. Two thirds of the cases were from the West Bank and the remainder were from Gaza. Major complaints at presentation were fatigue (64.1%), fever (46.9%), respiratory tract infections (39.1%) and bruising (28.1%). Hepatomegaly was present in 23.4% and splenomegaly in 34.4%. At presentation, the median white blood cells (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and platelet count were 30. 5x109/L, 9.3g/ dL, and 39.5 x109/L, respectively. According to the French American British (FAB) classification, M4 was the most common subtype (32.8%) followed by M3 (21.9%). After a single cycle of induction chemotherapy complete remission (CR) was seen in 26 (41.9%) and non-remission (NR) in 17 (27.4%), while 19 patients (30.6%) died during the first admission for induction. Conclusion: The characteristics of de novo AML in Palestinian patients are comparable to published data elsewhere. M4 was the most common subtype. The outcome of the first cycle of induction chemotherapy was slightly inferior to the published data for M3 patients. Further studies are warranted to identify possible causes.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*induction chemotherapy', '*treatment delay', '*Palestine']",PMC5720651,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) provides such information, covering the time period from 1994 to the present day. The current report concerns an overview of cancer incidence statistics for Saudi Arabia in 2012. Methods: The SCR collects data from healthcare facilities throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All newly diagnosed cases of cancer are recorded, with information on site and histology. For the present report, age-standardised and age-specific incidence rates (ASR, AIR, respectively) were calculated, with attention to gender-specific and regional differences. Results: The total number of incident cases of cancer identified by the SCR in 2012 was 14,336, with 6,791 (47.5%) among males and 7,545 (52.6%) among females. Of this total, 11,034 cases (76.9%) occurred in patients of Saudi origin. For Saudi males, the overall ASR (inc. all cancer sites) was 78.1 per 100,000 people, while that for females was 86.7. Incidence varied by region, with the Eastern region and Riyadh displaying the highest ASRs for both males and females, and Hail and Jazan displaying the lowest. Incidence varied by gender, with colorectal cancer (13.3%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 8.4%), and leukaemia (8.2%) being the most common types in males, and breast (25.8%), thyroid (11.7%), and colorectal cancers (9.3%) being the most common in females. Conclusions: This analysis of cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia demonstrated significant differences according to gender, age, and region of the Kingdom. The data should help ensure the most appropriate allocation of resources, with the aim of minimising the healthcare burden associated with cancer.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*incidence', '*Saudi Arabia', '*registry']",PMC5720648,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients admitted to the Haematology department during 7 months, and fulfilled inclusion criteria were divided into 4 groups: Group 1, patients with acute leukaemia; Group 2, patients after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT); Group 3, patients after allogeneic SCT; and Group 4, patients given platelet transfusion prior to intervention. We used frequent blood sampling within 24 hours after platelet transfusion to investigate the kinetics of platelet counts following transfusion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-four platelet transfusion occasions in patients with chemotherapy-induced bone marrow aplasia were included. The decrease in corrected count increment (CCI) 1-24 hours after platelet transfusions in all groups could be described as linear functions. For patients in the aggregated Groups 1-3, the decline was 2.0% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- standard deviation) per hour. For patients in Group 4, the decline of CCI was 2.8% +/- 1.2% per hour. We found no differences between the groups, either in the rate of platelet elimination from the bloodstream or in the mean CCI, in the first 24 hours post-transfusion.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, these anti-BCMA (CD269) CARs observe relapse as a common phenomenon after treatment due to the reemergence of either antigen-positive or -negative cells. Hence, the development of improvements in CAR design to target antigen loss and increase effector cell persistency represents a critical need. Here, we report on the anti-tumor activity of a CAR T-cell possessing two complete and independent CAR receptors against the multiple myeloma antigens BCMA and CS1. We determined that the resulting compound CAR (cCAR) T-cell possesses consistent, potent and directed cytotoxicity against each target antigen population. Using multiple mouse models of myeloma and mixed cell populations, we are further able to show superior in vivo survival by directed cytotoxicity against multiple populations compared to a single-expressing CAR T-cell. These findings indicate that compound targeting of BCMA and CS1 on myeloma cells can potentially be an effective strategy for augmenting the response against myeloma bulk disease and for initiation of broader coverage CAR therapy.",,,,PMC5808076,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML relapse after conventional chemotherapy is caused by a remaining population of drug-resistant LSCs. Selective targeting of the chemoresistant population is a promising strategy for preventing and treating AML relapse. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 to maintain the stemness of LSCs. Here, we show that quiescent LSCs expressed the highest levels of enhancer of zeste (EZH) 1 and EZH2, the PRC2 catalytic subunits, in the AML hierarchy, and that dual inactivation of EZH1/2 eradicated quiescent LSCs to cure AML. Genetic deletion of Ezh1/2 in a mouse AML model induced cell cycle progression of quiescent LSCs and differentiation to LSCs, eventually eradicating AML LSCs. Quiescent LSCs showed PRC2-mediated suppression of Cyclin D, and Cyclin D-overexpressing AML was more sensitive to chemotherapy. We have developed a novel EZH1/2 dual inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against both EZH1/2.

Taken together, these results show that dual inhibition of EZH1/2 is an effective strategy for eliminating AML LSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 27.,"CK2 is a ubiquitously expressed, constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase, which is considered the most pleiotropic protein kinase in the human kinome. Such a pleiotropy explains the involvement of CK2 in many cellular events. However, its predominant roles are stimulation of cell growth and prevention of apoptosis. High levels of CK2 messenger RNA and protein are associated with CK2 pathological functions in human cancers. Over the last decade, basic and translational studies have provided evidence of CK2 as a pivotal molecule driving the growth of different blood malignancies. CK2 overexpression has been demonstrated in nearly all the types of hematological cancers, including acute and chronic leukemias, where CK2 is a key regulator of signaling networks critical for cell proliferation, survival and drug resistance. The findings that emerged from these studies suggest that CK2 could be a valuable therapeutic target in leukemias and supported the initiation of clinical trials using CK2 antagonists. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the understanding of the signaling pathways involved in CK2 inhibition-mediated effects with a particular emphasis on the combinatorial use of CK2 inhibitors as novel therapeutic strategies for treating both acute and chronic leukemia patients.",,,,PMC5770594,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 23.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spinal bone metastases are common. They are mostly localized to the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. The most common primaries to result in spinal metastases include lung, breast, and prostate carcinomas in adults as opposed to leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma in children. In patients diagnosed with cancer, bone metastases are found in 40% and spinal metastases in 10%. In this study, we reviewed 25 patients diagnosed with a spinal metastasis of unknown primary who presented with low back pain or acute-onset neurologic deficits and underwent operative treatment. METHODS: The retrospective study included 25 patients with a spinal metastasis of unknown primary who presented to our clinic with acute-onset vertebral fracture or neurologic deficit. Statistical descriptions were obtained for each patient. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 25 patients included 17 men (68%) and 8 women (32%), with a mean age of 55 years (range, 14-81 years). Eleven patients (44%) presented with varying degrees of motor deficits ranging from flaccid paralysis to paraplegia. Motor deficits were completely reversed in 4 patients postoperatively. The tumors were localized to the upper thoracic spine (T1-4) in 2 patients, in the midthoracic spine (T5-8) in 2 patients, in the lower thoracic spine (T9-12) in 8 patients, in the cervical 7 in 1 patient, and in the lumbar spine in 12 patients. In 10 patients, the tumor affected multiple spinal regions. Nonosseous tumors were not present in 10 patients. Ten patients had an extradural tumor. Costal involvement was detected in 2 patients. The tumors were pathologically identified as lung cancer (n = 3), lymphoma (n = 5), breast cancer (n = 3), gastric cancer (n = 2), liver cancer (n = 2), prostate cancer (n = 2), renal cell carcinoma (n = 2), malignant melanoma (n = 1), plasmacytoma (n = 1), bladder cancer (n = 1), paraganglioma (n = 1), Ewing sarcoma (n = 1), and yolk sac carcinoma (n = 1). Posterior instrumentation was performed in patients with instability. In addition, decompression was performed in patients with neurologic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that 10% of patients with cancer are diagnosed by vertebral metastasis, presence of malignancy should be suspected and a detailed examination should be performed in patients presenting with vertebral fractures caused by no or minor trauma. Moreover, in patients presenting with neurologic deficit, soft tissue metastases leading to spinal cord compression should be kept in mind and further examinations should be promptly administered.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Oct 6.,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) is reported as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic agent. Nevertheless, a variety of cancer cells, including human malignant glioma cells, are resistant to TRAIL treatment, indicating that it is necessary to find effective strategies to overcome the TRAIL resistance. Linarin (LIN), a natural flavonoid compound in Flos Chrysanthemi Indici (FCI), has been exhibited to exert various pharmacological activities, including anti-cancer. Here in our study, we found that non-cytotoxic doses of LIN (5muM) dramatically potentiated TRAIL (80ng/ml)-induced cytotoxicity (52.36+/-1.58%) and apoptosis (68.50+/-1.23%) using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays, respectively, in human glioma cells of U87MG. Apoptosis was evidenced by enhanced cleavage of Caspase-8/-9/-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and reduced anti-apoptotic proteins, including B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), mantle cell lymphoma (Mcl)-1, and Survivin. Moreover, both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways were included in apoptosis induced by LIN and TRAIL co-treatment, along with high release of Cyto-c into cytoplasm and enhancement of fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), death receptor 4 (DR) 4 and DR5, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, up to 39.86+/-2.32%, was also highly triggered by TRAIL and LIN combinational treatment, which was accompanied with high phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). In vivo, TRAIL and LIN double treatment significantly reduced the tumor growth using xenograft tumor model through inducing apoptosis. We demonstrated that combining LIN with TRAIL treatments might be effective against TRAIL-resistant glioma cells through inducing apoptosis regulated by ROS generation.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

To review the safety, efficacy, and current clinical stage of TKIs in different malignancies, particularly leukemia, advanced gastrointestinal and breast cancer, whole literature over the last decade (2006 to 2017) were searched to find all related studies. Criticizing current data indicates that TKIs have shown better clinical outcome in terms of both safety and efficacy compared to conventional therapies.

Epub 2017 Sep 26.,"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutics to overcome resistance in cancer treatment. Sphingosine kinase-2 (SphK2) a key regulator of sphingolipid signaling has been rationalized as an important therapeutic target. We evaluated the role of SphK2 in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells via altering c-FLIPS, MCL-1 and survivin expressions in order to overcome chemoresistance. METHODS: Proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and DAPI staining, respectively. Cell population in each phase of cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric assay. Gene and protein expression levels were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a SphK2 stimulator, decreased cell death induced by IC50 of DOX (1.1 microM) to around 70% (p<0.01). Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant accumulation of the cells in S phase with a marked decrease in sub G1 phase when we incubated the cells with combined treatment of PMA and DOX (p<0.05). Adding ABC294640 (40 microM), a SphK2 inhibitor, significantly abolished PMA effect on cell survival (p<0.01). Survivin expression was significantly diminished by applying ABC294640 either alone or in DOX treated cells followed by increase in cell death (p<0.05), however, there was no significant change in MCL-1 expression by ABC294640 either alone or in DOX treated cells (p=0.16) and (p=0.06), respectively. CONCLUSION: Identifying cancer patients with high SphK2 expression and then inhibiting of SphK2 activity can be considered as an important strategy to increase the efficacy of DOX in the induction of apoptosis.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

This is often done by clustering somatic variants based on their cellular prevalence estimated via bulk tumor sequencing of multiple samples. The clusters, consisting of the clonal marker variants, are then ordered based on their estimated cellular prevalence to reconstruct clonal evolution trees, a process referred to as 'clonal ordering'. However, cellular prevalence estimate is confounded by statistical variability and errors in sequencing/data analysis, and therefore inhibits accurate reconstruction of the clonal evolution. This problem is further complicated by intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, the field lacks a comprehensive visualization tool to facilitate the interpretation of complex clonal relationships. To address these challenges we developed ClonEvol, a unified software tool for clonal ordering, visualization, and interpretation. Materials and methods: ClonEvol uses a bootstrap resampling technique to estimate the cellular fraction of the clones and probabilistically models the clonal ordering constraints to account for statistical variability. The bootstrapping allows identification of the sample founding- and sub-clones, thus enabling interpretation of clonal seeding. ClonEvol automates the generation of multiple widely used visualizations for reconstructing and interpreting clonal evolution. Results: ClonEvol outperformed three of the state of the art tools (LICHeE, Canopy and PhyloWGS) for clonal evolution inference, showing more robust error tolerance and producing more accurate trees in a simulation. Building upon multiple recent publications that utilized ClonEvol to study metastasis and drug resistance in solid cancers, here we show that ClonEvol rediscovered relapsed subclones in two published acute myeloid leukemia patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that through noninvasive monitoring ClonEvol recapitulated the emerging subclones throughout metastatic progression observed in the tumors of a published breast cancer patient. Conclusions: ClonEvol has broad applicability for longitudinal monitoring of clonal populations in tumor biopsies, or noninvasively, to guide precision medicine.

Although remission is achieved in most patients with newly diagnosed disease, relapse occurs in most cases. For more than 40 years, the standard up-front induction treatment has been a combination of continuous-infusion cytarabine and an anthracycline. Risk stratification by molecular and cytogenetic characteristics and measurable residual disease (MRD) status informs decisions regarding referral to consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. In 2017, for the first time in years, 4 drugs are under consideration for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. One of these agents, the multikinase inhibitor midostaurin, has already been approved for the treatment of patients with FLT3-mutated AML. The heterogeneity of AML suggests that single-target agents are unlikely to succeed at curing large numbers of patients, and that combinations of novel agents and traditional chemotherapy will be required to achieve this goal. Additionally, the 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria suggest that treating physicians should strive for the new, stringent remission category (ie, complete remission without MRD). How the new drug approvals in 2017 will change practice is not clear, and further work remains to be done in treating and curing patients with AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase 1/2 open-label study evaluated the safety and efficacy of WT4869, and biomarkers for response, in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. WT4869 (5-1200 mug/dose) was administered intradermally every 2 weeks, according to a 3 + 3 dose-escalation method in higher-risk (International Prognostic Scoring System score >/=1.5) or lower-risk (score <1.5) red blood cell transfusion-dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Twenty-six patients were enrolled and treated (median age, 75 years; range, 32 to 89). The most common adverse event was injection site reaction (61.5%). Main grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (30.8%), febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, elevated blood creatine phosphokinase levels and hypoalbuminemia (all 7.7%). Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 1 patient in the 50 mug/dose cohort (pyrexia, muscle hemorrhage and hypoalbuminemia) and 1 patient in the 400 mug/dose cohort (pneumonitis); however, the maximum tolerated dose could not be determined from this trial. The overall response rate was 18.2%, the disease control rate was 59.1% and median overall survival was 64.71 weeks (95% confidence interval: 50.29, 142.86) as assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.

Epub 2017 Sep 26.,"Fenvalerate (Fen), a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in agricultural, domestic and veterinary applications. Fen induces abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are linked to its hazardous effects. However, this view is controversial and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, the effects of Fen on cadmium (Cd)-induced apoptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms were investigated in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. U937 cells were treated with 50 mum cadmium chloride (CdCl2 ) with or without Fen pretreatment at 1-50 mum. Apoptosis was evaluated by externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2 family members were determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that pretreatment with Fen at 20 mum for 12 hours significantly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis. Decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Noxa and Bid) and increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP) were observed after combined treatment with Fen and CdCl2 . Phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was increased, while phosphorylation of JNK was decreased by the combined treatment, compared with CdCl2 treatment alone. In conclusion, Fen decreased apoptotic sensitivity induced by Cd in U937 cells. This effect was associated with activation of ERK and AKT, suppression of JNK and changes in expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and XIAP.

A control participant and a newly diagnosed patient with acute myeloid leukemia prior to induction chemotherapy were scanned with FLT-PET and DECT. The red marrow (RM) and yellow marrow (YM) of the BME were segmented from DECT using a basis material decomposition method. Functional total marrow irradiation (fTMI) treatment planning simulations were performed combining FLT-PET and DECT imaging to differentially target irradiation to the leukemia niche and the rest of the skeleton. Leukemia colonized both RM and YM regions, adheres to the cortical bone in the spine, and has enhanced activity in the proximal/distal femur, suggesting a potential association of leukemia with the BME. The planning target volume was reduced significantly in fTMI compared with conventional TMI. The dose to active disease (standardized uptake value >4) was increased by 2-fold, while maintaining doses to critical organs similar to those in conventional TMI.

We summarize the current evidence on relations between an emergent new candidate, zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) transcription factor and the major components constituting the metabolic syndrome. Information stemming from studies on experimental models with altered Zbtb16 expression clearly shows its effect on adipogenesis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, lipid levels and insulin sensitivity. Based on current evidence, we provide a network view of relations between ZBTB16 and hallmarks of metabolic syndrome in order to elucidate the potential functional links involving the ZBTB16 node. Many of the identified genes interconnecting ZBTB16 with all or most metabolic syndrome components are linked to immune function, inflammation or oxidative stress. In summary, ZBTB16 represents a promising pleiotropic candidate node for metabolic syndrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy (CT)-associated oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating and painful side effects in oncology patients, with limited effective management options. During CT, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are upregulated, causing damage in mucosal and submucosal tissues, and playing a key role in OM; therefore, the use of subantimicrobial doxycycline as a MMP inhibitor may represent a potential approach for OM management. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of doxycycline in OM development in individuals with acute leukaemia (AL) during CT. METHODS: Randomized controlled clinical trial (Registration No. NCT01087476) performed in adult AL patients scheduled to receive CT (September 2010-October 2014). Individuals were stratified by leukaemia type and assigned randomly to receive doxycycline hyclate (50 mg/d) (doxycycline group: DG) or placebo (placebo group: PG) before and during CT. Included subjects had a baseline oral examination and thereafter 3 times a week during 21 days. The primary outcome was OM development. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: One hundred and forty-seven AL subjects were enrolled: 74 in DG and 73 in PG; baseline characteristics between groups were comparable. During follow-up, 15 (10.2%) individuals developed OM; no differences between treatment groups were found (DG:8.1%, PG:12.3%; P = .59). The mean OM Assessment Scale score was 2.51, without differences between groups (DG:2.7, PG:2.4; P = .65). Low baseline blood albumin levels in the OM-affected individuals were identified, revealing the effect of systemic deterioration as a predisposing factor for OM development. No adverse effects were observed. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline did not reduce the incidence, onset, duration or severity of OM.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*doxycycline', '*matrix metalloproteinases', '*oral mucositis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has shown its antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo systems. However, the mechanisms at the basis of CAP-cell interaction are not yet completely understood. The aim of this study is to investigate CAP proapoptotic effect and identify some of the molecular mechanisms triggered by CAP in human T-lymphoblastoid leukemia cells. CAP treatment was performed by means of a wand electrode DBD source driven by nanosecond high-voltage pulses under different operating conditions. The biological endpoints were assessed through flow cytometry and real-time PCR. CAP caused apoptosis in Jurkat cells mediated by p53 upregulation. To test the involvement of intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathway, the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-8 was analyzed. The activation of caspase-8 and the upregulation of Bax and Bcl-2 were observed. Moreover, CAP treatment increased ROS intracellular level. The situation reverts after a longer time of treatment. This is probably due to compensatory cellular mechanisms such as the posttranscriptional upregulation of SOD1, CAT, and GSR2. According to ROS increase, CAP induced a significant increase in DNA damage at all treatment conditions. In conclusion, our results provide a deeper understanding of CAP potential in the oncological field and pose the basis for the evaluation of its toxicological profile.",,,,PMC5602509,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various alterations in cell adhesion, metabolism, cytokine signaling, autophagy, and methylation patterns of tumor-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been demonstrated, contributing to the genesis of a leukemic permissive niche. This niche allows both the ineffective haematopoiesis typical of myelodysplastic syndromes and the differentiation arrest, proliferation advantage, and clone selection which is the hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, the immune system, both adaptive and innate, encompassing mesenchymal-derived cells, has been shown to take part to the leukemic niche. Here, we critically review the state of art about mesenchymal stem cell role in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, focusing on immune escaping mechanisms as a target for available and future anticancer therapies.",,,,PMC5602646,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among proteins participating, ZAP-70 enhances response to microenvironmental stimuli. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in diverse neoplasias including CLL, where it has been associated to refractoriness to fludarabine and to shorter time to progression and survival. To further elucidate the role of ZAP-70 in the biology of CLL, we studied its involvement in miR-21 regulation. MiR-21 expression was higher in CLL cells with high ZAP-70. Ectopic expression of ZAP-70 induced transcription of miR-21 via MAPK and STAT3, which subsequently induced downregulation of tumor suppressors targeted by miR-21. The co-culture of primary CLL cells mimicking the microenvironment induced ZAP-70 and miR-21 expression, as well as downregulation of miR-21 targets. Interestingly, the increase in miR-21 after co-culture was significantly impaired by ibrutinib, indicating that the BCR signaling pathway is involved in its regulation. Finally, survival of CLL cells induced by the co-culture correlated with miR-21 upregulation. In conclusion, stimuli from the microenvironment regulate miR-21 and its targeted tumor suppressor genes via a signaling pathway involving ZAP-70, thus contributing to the cytoprotection offered by the microenvironment particularly observed in CLL cells expressing ZAP-70.",,,,PMC5612928,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex-PCR) was performed to detect GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms simultaneously and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was conducted to detect the GSTP1 Ile195Val polymorphism. On evaluating the association of the variant genotype with treatment outcome, heterozygous variant (AG) and homozygous variant (GG) of GSTP1 Ile105Val showed significantly a higher risk for the development of resistance to IM with OR: 1.951 (95% CI: 1.186-3.209, P = 0.009) and OR: 3.540 (95% CI: 1.305-9.606, P = 0.013), respectively. Likewise, GSTT1 null genotype was also associated with a significantly higher risk for the development of resistance to IM with OR = 1.664 (95% CI: 1.011-2.739, P = 0.045).

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Purpose: Treatment options are limited for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The azanucleosides, azacitidine and decitabine, are first-line therapy for MDS that induce promoter demethylation and gene expression of the highly immunogenic tumor antigen NY-ESO-1. We demonstrated that patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving decitabine exhibit induction of NY-ESO-1 expression in circulating blasts. We hypothesized that vaccinating against NY-ESO-1 in patients with MDS receiving decitabine would capitalize upon induced NY-ESO-1 expression in malignant myeloid cells to provoke an NY-ESO-1-specific MDS-directed cytotoxic T-cell immune response.Experimental Design: In a phase I study, 9 patients with MDS received an HLA-unrestricted NY-ESO-1 vaccine (CDX-1401 + poly-ICLC) in a nonoverlapping schedule every four weeks with standard-dose decitabine.Results: Analysis of samples serially obtained from the 7 patients who reached the end of the study demonstrated induction of NY-ESO-1 expression in 7 of 7 patients and NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses in 6 of 7 and 4 of 7 of the vaccinated patients, respectively. Myeloid cells expressing NY-ESO-1, isolated from a patient at different time points during decitabine therapy, were capable of activating a cytotoxic response from autologous NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes. Vaccine responses were associated with a detectable population of CD141(Hi) conventional dendritic cells, which are critical for the uptake of NY-ESO-1 vaccine and have a recognized role in antitumor immune responses.Conclusions: These data indicate that vaccination against induced NY-ESO-1 expression can produce an antigen-specific immune response in a relatively nonimmunogenic myeloid cancer and highlight the potential for induced antigen-directed immunotherapy in a group of patients with limited options.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Hematologic malignancies are rare cancers that develop refractory disease upon patient relapse, resulting in decreased life expectancy and quality of life. DNA repair inhibitors are a promising strategy to treat cancer but are limited by their hematologic toxicity in combination with conventional chemotherapies. Dbait are large molecules targeting the signaling of DNA damage and inhibiting all the double-strand DNA break pathways. Dbait have been shown to sensitize resistant solid tumors to radiotherapy and platinum salts. Here, we analyze the efficacy and lack of toxicity of AsiDNA, a cholesterol form of Dbait, in hematologic malignancies. We show that AsiDNA enters cells via LDL receptors and activates its molecular target, the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) in 10 lymphoma and leukemia cell lines (Jurkat-E6.1, MT-4, MOLT-4, 174xCEM.T2, Sup-T1, HuT-78, Raji, IM-9, THP-1, and U-937) and in normal primary human PBMCs, resting or activated T cells, and CD34(+) progenitors. The treatment with AsiDNA induced necrotic and mitotic cell death in most cancer cell lines and had no effect on blood or bone marrow cells, including immune activation, proliferation, or differentiation. Sensitivity to AsiDNA was independent of p53 status. Survival to combined treatment with conventional therapies (etoposide, cyclophosphamides, vincristine, or radiotherapy) was analyzed by isobolograms and combination index. AsiDNA synergized with all treatments, except vincristine, without increasing their toxicity to normal blood cells. AsiDNA is a novel, potent, and wide-range drug with the potential to specifically increase DNA-damaging treatment toxicity in tumor without adding toxicity in normal hematologic cells or inducing immune dysregulation.

This may have implications when assessing outcomes by ethnicity. An alternative method for assigning ethnicity is using naming algorithms. We investigate if the association between ethnicity and cancer incidence varied dependent on how ethnic group was assigned. DESIGN: Population-based cancer registry cohort study. SETTING: Yorkshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Cancer registrations from 1998 to 2009 in children and young people (0-29 years) from a specialist cancer register in Yorkshire, UK (n=3998) were linked to inpatient HES data to obtain recorded ethnicity. Patients' names, recorded in the cancer register, were matched to an ethnic group using the naming algorithm software Onomap. Each source of ethnicity was categorised as white, South Asian (SA) or Other, and a further two indicators were defined based on the combined ethnicities of HES and Onomap, one prioritising HES results, the other prioritising Onomap. OUTCOMES: Incidence rate ratios (IRR) between ethnic groups were compared using Poisson regression for all cancers combined, leukaemia, lymphoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumours. RESULTS: Depending on the indicator used, 7.1%-8.6% of the study population were classified as SA. For all cancers combined there were no statistically significant differences between white and SA groups using any indicator; however, for lymphomas significant differences were only evident using one of the 'Combined' indicators (IRR=1.36 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.71)), and for CNS tumours incidence was lower using three of the four indicators. For the other ethnic group the IRR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.78 (0.65 to 0.94) to 1.41 (1.23 to 1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"SNPs in IKZF1 are associated with inherited susceptibility to B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Besides, somatic copy number abnormalities (CNA) in genes related to lymphopoiesis (e.g., IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, BTG1) impact patient's outcome. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate an association between germline susceptibility and CNAs in BCP-ALL. The IKZF1 SNPs (rs11978267 and rs4132601) were genotyped in 276 cases and 467 controls. Bone marrow samples were used to determine the presence of somatic abnormalities. The IKZF1 transcript levels were quantified and associated with the SNPs and CNAs. Categorical variables were compared by chi(2) test. ORs were estimated with unconditional logistic regression with 95% confidence interval (CI). The variant allele of IKZF1 rs4132601 conferred increased risk of BCP-ALL (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.16-3.74). Individuals with either rs11978267 or rs4132601 had an increased risk for harboring IKZF1 deletion (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.25-6.23 and OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.24-6.69, respectively). Increased risks were observed for individuals harboring both IKZF1 and BTG1 deletions (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 1.65-14.55, rs11978267 and OR, 5.80; 95% CI, 1.94-17.41, rs4132601). Germline genetic variation increases the risk for childhood ALL in general, but also acts as a susceptibility factor bound for risk of specific somatic alterations. These findings provide new insight into the development of childhood ALL regarding causal variants and the biological basis of the risk association, offering the opportunity for future tailored research.

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood cancer that is poorly responsive to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and a diagnosis of AML is usually fatal. More effective and better-tolerated therapies for AML are desperately needed. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are one of the most frequently observed genetic defects in AML. FLT3 inhibitors have shown impressive anti-leukemic activity in clinical trials; however, sustained remissions using these inhibitors as monotherapy have not been achieved. Our previous studies have implicated impaired glutamine metabolism in response to FLT3 inhibitors as a dominant factor causing AML cell death. In this study, we have employed metabolic flux analysis to examine the effects of FLT3 inhibition on glutamine utilization in FLT3-mutated AML cells using stable isotope tracers. We found that the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 inhibited glutamine flux into the antioxidant factor glutathione profoundly due to defective glutamine import. We also found that the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 similarly impaired glutathione production by effectively blocking flux of glutamine into glutamate. Moreover, the combination of AC220 with CB-839 synergized to deplete glutathione, induce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and cause loss of viability through apoptotic cell death. In vivo, glutaminase inhibition with CB-839 facilitated leukemic cell elimination by AC220 and improved survival significantly in a patient-derived xenograft AML mouse model. Therefore, targeting glutaminase in combination with FLT3 may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for improving treatment of FLT3-mutated AML.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

This study aimed to examine the effect of prolamin on anti-tumor immune response in vitro and leukemia growth in vivo. The prolamin-enriched rice fractions were prepared to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from mice spleen. The MNC-conditioned medium (MNC-CM) was collected to treat leukemia L1210 cells. Human MNC-CM was prepared to treat Jurkat acute T cell leukemia cells. Purified prolamin was orally administered to syngeneic L1210-bearing DBA/2 mice to assess weights of tumor, liver and spleen, liver histopathology, peripheral blood neutrophil count and cytokine levels. Prolamin-prepared MNC-CM inhibited the viability of murine leukemia L1210 cells and human leukemia Jurkat cells, indicating an immunomodulatory effect. In syngeneic L1210-bearing DBA/2 mice, oral administration of purified prolamin dose-dependently decreased the tumor weight and attenuated the leukemia-induced reduction of liver and spleen weights. Prolamin inhibited the increase of peripheral blood leukocyte count. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in MNC-CM and mice serum were significantly increased by prolamin treatment. No significant change in body weight, serum alanine aminotransferase and creatinine levels was noted by prolamin treatment. Rice prolamin could effectively promote anti-tumor immunity and inhibit leukemia growth without significant toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies done by our lab indicated that cinobufacini could suppress HCC cells through mitochondria-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways. Here, we use a combination of cinobufacini and doxorubicin to inhibit the growth of HCC cells. The combination group induced more significant apoptosis by affecting proteins and RNA of apoptosis-related elements, such as Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, and cytochrome c. Furthermore, cinobufacini, as a mixture of a number of components, had stronger apoptosis-inducing activity than particular individual components or a simple mixture of a few components. Overall, these results suggested that the combination of cinobufacini and doxorubicin may provide a new strategy for inhibiting the proliferation of HCC cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bufalin', 'Cinobufacini', 'Cinobufagin', 'Combination Therapy', 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine', 'Doxorubicin', 'Hepatocellular Carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in children with hematooncological malignancies is increasing as a result of intensive treatment, immunosuppression, and extended use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Infection of the GI tract by Aspergillus spp. is a rare and fatal complication, which often requires surgical diagnostic and therapeutic exploration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of symptomatic intestinal aspergillosis, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of pediatric patients with an underlying hemato-oncologic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2,307 German patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from age 1 to 17 years registered in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study from 2000 to 2006. All reported adverse events were assessed for symptoms of IA and retrospectively reviewed for any sign or proof of intestinal involvement of IA. RESULTS: In this cohort, IA was reported in 30 of 2,307 patients while intestinal involvement was documented in five patients. Four of these patients had intestinal symptoms and three patients underwent explorative laparotomy. Among clinical cases with IA, gastrointestinal manifestation of IA mostly occurred in adolescent patients (10-16 years). Symptoms varied from abdominal tenderness and pain to constipation. Intestinal aspergillosis was proven by microbiological and histopathological examination and fungal infection was observed macroscopically in the jejunal lumen during surgery. Despite the extended surgery and antifungal therapy, outcome of disseminated IA with intestinal involvement remains poor. CONCLUSION: Surgeons should be aware of surgical complications of intestinal aspergillosis in children with hematooncological diseases requiring exploration and resection. IA is a rare event and still difficult to diagnose due to unspecific abdominal symptoms. Thus, biopsy sampling is of utmost importance to ensure diagnosis, and resection of necrotic or perforated tissue should be attempted early.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Patients and methods: We addressed this question using data from two prospective randomized controlled trials on intensive induction- and risk-stratified postremission therapy. The NPM1mut-neg/CEBPAdm-neg/FLT3-ITDneg AML subgroup comprised 497 patients, aged 18-60 years. Results: In donor versus no-donor analyses, patients with a matched related donor had a longer relapse-free survival (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9, P = 0.02) and a trend toward better overall survival (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P = 0.08) compared with patients who received postremission chemotherapy. Notably, only 58% of patients in the donor group were transplanted in CR1. We therefore complemented the donor versus no-donor analysis with multivariable Cox regression analyses, where alloHCT was tested as a time-dependent covariate: overall survival (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.9, P = 0.02) and relapse-free survival (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.76; P = 0.001) for patients who received alloHCT compared with chemotherapy in CR1 were significantly longer. Conclusion: Outside clinical trials, alloHCT should be the preferred postremission treatment of patients with intermediate risk NPM1mut-neg/CEBPAdm-neg/FLT3-ITDneg AML in CR1.

Regardless of the SM variant, expansion of neoplastic MC in the skin and other organs is triggered by mutant forms of KIT, the most prevalent being D816V. Activation of MC with subsequent release of chemical mediators is often caused by IgE-dependent mechanisms in these patients. Midostaurin, also known as PKC412, blocks the kinase activity of wild-type KIT and KIT D816V, counteracts KIT-dependent growth of neoplastic MC, and inhibits IgE-dependent mediator secretion. Based on this activity-profile, the drug has been used for treatment of patients with advanced SM. Indeed, encouraging results have been obtained with the drug in a recent multi-center phase II trial in patients with advanced SM, with an overall response rate of 60% and a substantial decrease in the burden of neoplastic MC in various organs. Moreover, midostaurin improved the overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients with advanced SM compared with historical controls. In addition, midostaurin was found to improve mediator-related symptoms and quality of life, suggesting that the drug may also be useful in patients with indolent SM suffering from mediator-related symptoms resistant to conventional therapies or those with MC activation syndromes. Ongoing and future studies will determine the actual value of midostaurin-induced MC depletion and MC deactivation in these additional indications.","['(c) The Author 2017.

However, second neoplasms (SN) are a devastating event. METHODS: From August 1987 to December 2016, 34 of 3321 (1%) patients with diagnosis of AL or lymphoma developed SN. SN were AL (n=16), CNS tumors (n=5), endocrinal tumors (n=3), lymphomas (n=2), schwannoma (n=2) assorted sarcomas (n=4), retinal melanoma (n=1), and Vanek tumor (n=1). Median latency was 51 (range, 10 to 110) months for hematological malignancies and 119 (range, 25 to 236) months for solid tumors (P=0.001). RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with SN were treated taking into account cumulative doses of anthracyclines and radiotherapy. Twenty-three (67.6%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), 5 died early during therapy and 5 were refractory or partial responders. Six patients presented relapses of the SN and 1 died in CR. Seventeen patients remain alive in CR, with a median follow-up of 110 (range, 4 to 276) months. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The latency period was significantly longer for patients developing solid tumors than for those developing AL. (2) AL was the most frequent SN. (3) Our results strongly encourage giving standard therapy to SN, considering cumulative doses of previous treatment, since similar probabilities of surviving as ""de novo"" counterparts can be achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Thiopurines are part of a clinical regimen used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, despite these successes, there are also unintended consequences such as therapy-induced cancer in long-term survivors. Therefore, a better understanding of cellular responses to thiopurines will lead to improved and personalized treatment strategies. RAD51D is an important component of homologous recombination (HR), and our previous work established that mammalian cells defective for RAD51D are more sensitive to the thiopurine 6-thioguanine (6TG) and have dramatically increased numbers of multinucleated cells and chromosome instability. 6TG is capable of being incorporated into telomeres, and interestingly, RAD51D contributes to telomere maintenance, although the precise function of RAD51D at the telomeres remains unclear. We sought here to investigate: (1) the activity of RAD51D at telomeres, (2) the contribution of RAD51D to protect against 6TG-induced telomere damage, and (3) the fates of Rad51d-deficient cells following 6TG treatment. These results demonstrate that RAD51D is required for maintaining the telomeric 3' overhangs. As measured by gamma-H2AX induction and foci formation, 6TG induced DNA damage in Rad51d-proficient and Rad51d-deficient cells. However, the extent of gamma-H2AX telomere localization following 6TG treatment was higher in Rad51d-deficient cells than in Rad51d-proficient cells. Using live-cell imaging of 6TG-treated Rad51d-deficient cells, two predominant forms of mitotic catastrophe were found to contribute to the formation of multinucleated cells, failed division and restitution. Collectively, these findings provide a unique window into the role of the RAD51D HR protein during thiopurine induction of mitotic catastrophe. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 59:38-48, 2018.

Here we find that these apparently contradictory activities are fine-tuned by insulin. In the absence of insulin, the combination of these cytokines supports endoderm in a context-dependent manner. When applied to naive pluripotent cells that resemble peri-implantation embryos, ActA and Wnt induce extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PrE), whereas when applied to primed pluripotent epiblast stem cells (EpiSC), these cytokines induce gastrulation-stage embryonic definitive endoderm. In naive embryonic stem cell culture, we find that insulin complements LIF signalling to support self-renewal; however, when it is removed, LIF, ActA and Wnt signalling not only induce PrE differentiation, but also support its expansion. Self-renewal of these PrE cultures is robust and, on the basis of gene expression, these cells resemble early blastocyst-stage PrE, a naive endoderm state able to make both visceral and parietal endoderm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc) is an epigenetic co-activator complex that makes direct contact with MLL fusion proteins and is involved in AML, however, its functions are not well understood. Here, we explored the transcriptional targets regulated by the PAFc that facilitate leukemia by performing RNA-sequencing after conditional loss of the PAFc subunit Cdc73. We found Cdc73 promotes expression of an early hematopoietic progenitor gene program that prevents differentiation. Among the target genes, we confirmed the protein arginine methyltransferase Prmt5 is a direct target that is positively regulated by a transcriptional unit that includes the PAFc, MLL1, HOXA9 and STAT5 in leukemic cells. We observed reduced PRMT5-mediated H4R3me2s following excision of Cdc73 placing this histone modification downstream of the PAFc and revealing a novel mechanism between the PAFc and Prmt5. Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of Prmt5 causes a G1 arrest and reduced proliferation resulting in extended leukemic disease latency in vivo. Overall, we demonstrate the PAFc regulates Prmt5 to facilitate leukemic progression and is a potential therapeutic target for AMLs.",,,,PMC5785415,"['R00 CA158136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207272/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA140044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS896909'],,,,,,,

However, RA-based therapy is limited by relapse in patients associated with RA resistance, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. Here, we suggest a new molecular mechanism of RA resistance by a repressor, named RA resistance factor (RaRF). RaRF suppressed transcriptional activity of the RA receptor (RAR) by directly interacting with and sequestering RAR to the nucleolus in response to RA. RaRF was highly expressed in RA-resistant leukemia cells and its expression was strongly correlated with RA sensitivity. MCL1 was upregulated by RA treatment upon RaRF depletion, accompanying leukemic myeloblast differentiation, which is negatively regulated by ectopic RaRF expression. Collectively, we propose that RaRF may be a factor in the resistance mechanism and thus a potential target for leukemia therapy using RA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 17.,"BACKGROUND: The increase in hospital acquisition of community oncology clinics in the US has led to a shift in the site-of-care (SOC) for infusion therapy from the physician office (PO) to the hospital outpatient (HO) setting. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences by SOC in treatment patterns, quality, and cost among patients with cancer undergoing first-line infusion therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis identified adult patients from Humana medical claims who initiated infusion therapy from 2008-2012 for five common cancer types in which infusion therapy is likely, including early stage breast cancer; metastatic breast, lung, and colorectal cancers; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Differences by SOC in first-line treatment patterns and quality of care at end-of-life, defined as infusions or hospitalizations 30 days prior to death, were evaluated using Wilcoxon-Rank Sum and Chi-square tests where appropriate. Differences in cost by SOC were evaluated using risk-adjusted generalized linear models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment patterns, quality of care at end of life, healthcare costs. RESULTS: There were differences in duration of therapy and number of infusions for some therapy regimens by SOC, in which patients in the HO had shorter duration of therapy and fewer infusions. There were no differences in quality of care at end-of-life by SOC. Total healthcare costs were 15% higher among patients in HO ($55,965) compared with PO ($48,439), p < .0001. LIMITATIONS: Analyses was restricted to a claims-based population of cancer patients within a health plan. CONCLUSION: This study, in an older, predominantly Medicare Advantage oncology cohort, found differences by SOC in treatment patterns and cost, but not quality. Where differences were found, patients receiving care in the HO had shorter duration of therapy and fewer infusions for specific treatment regimens, but higher healthcare costs than those treated in a PO.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Site of care', 'cancer treatment patterns', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'early stage breast cancer', 'first-line infusion therapy', 'metastatic breast cancer', 'metastatic colorectal cancer', 'metastatic lung cancer', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Achieving better disease control in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has proven challenging. Overall survival has been impacted by addressing treatment related mortality with focused supportive care measures. Despite this improvement, it remains difficult to induce durable leukemia remissions despite aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens. The addition of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) has allowed further treatment intensification and provided the benefit of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, HSCT carries the risk of transplant related morbidities, particularly GVHD, and anti-tumor responsiveness is still suboptimal. Thus, there is a need for alternate therapies. Immunotherapy has the potential to address this need. Areas covered: Expert opinion: The elusiveness of an ideal surface antigen target together with an immunosuppressive leukemic microenvironment add to the already difficult challenge in developing AML-targeted immunotherapies. Though many hurdles remain, recent translational discovery and progressive clinical advances anticipate exciting future developments. AREAS COVERED: This review highlights promises and challenges to immune-based therapies for AML.

Epub 2017 Oct 6.,"INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of the prototypical phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor idelalisib for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) has led to development of multiple compounds targeting this pathway. Areas Covered: We review the hypothesized therapeutic mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, including abrogation of B cell receptor signaling, blockade of microenvironmental pro-survival signals, and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. We examine toxicities of idelalisib, including bacterial infections (possibly secondary to drug-induced neutropenia), opportunistic infections (possibly attributable to on-target inhibition of T cell function), and organ toxicities such as transaminitis and enterocolitis (possibly autoimmune, secondary to on-target inhibition of p110delta in regulatory T cells). We evaluate PI3K inhibitors that have entered trials for the treatment of lymphoma, focusing on agents with selectivity for PI3Kalpha and PI3Kdelta. Expert Opinion: PI3K inhibitors, particularly those that target p110delta, have robust efficacy in the treatment of CLL and iNHL. However, idelalisib has infectious and autoimmune toxicities that limit its use. Outside of trials, idelalisib should be restricted to CLL patients with progression on ibrutinib or iNHL patients with progression on two prior therapies. Whether newer PI3K inhibitors will demonstrate differentiated toxicity profiles in comparable patient populations while retaining efficacy remains to be seen.",,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3-kinase inhibitors', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'copanlisib', 'duvelisib', 'idelalisib', 'indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'umbralisib']",PMC5747968,"['R01 CA213442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS913337'],,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 24.,"OBJECTIVE: Allogeneic stem-cell transplant (allo-SCT) is the standard of care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who relapse after frontline chemotherapy; however, for patients who relapse after allo-SCT, outcomes are very poor. Few studies have examined overall survival in this patient population, particularly in patients who received a second allo-SCT. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis using data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry. The study population included patients aged 3 to 21 years who were diagnosed with B-ALL and underwent their first allo-SCT between 2009 and 2013. The primary endpoint was the time from the date of posttransplant relapse to the date of death due to any reason. RESULTS: Outcomes in 1349 pediatric and young-adult patients were included in this analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of survival at 3 years after first allo-SCT was 63.1% (95% CI, 60.2%-65.8%). Overall, 29.2% of patients relapsed after first allo-SCT and had a median survival of 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.0-9.6 months). Twenty-five patients in the analysis developed secondary malignancies, most of which were lymphoproliferative disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates are low in pediatric and young-adult patients who relapse after first and second allo-SCT, and new therapies are needed to improve outcomes in this population. This data can be used as a historical comparison for single-arm trials of novel therapies for this patient population, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*allogeneic stem-cell transplant', '*pediatric', '*survival']",,,,,,,,['Curr Med Res Opin. 2018 Mar;34(3):517-519.

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"T cellassociated inflammation, particularly type 2 inflammation, has an important role in asthma pathogenesis, which is suppressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 2 (PIM2), a member off the serine/threonine kinase family, promotes the growth and survival of T cells and influences the function of Treg cells. However, whether PIM2 affects asthma pathogenesis remains unclear. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Treg cells from asthmatic and healthy subjects were obtained, and the expression level of PIM2 was measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. In addition, BALB/c female mice sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin were used as an asthma model, and PIM2 inhibitor was injected during the challenge period to observe the effect of PIM2 on asthma. The asthma symptoms were recorded, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), expression levels of cytokines in the serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the number of BALF leukocytes were evaluated. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry of lung tissues was performed. The results demonstrated that PIM2 was overexpressed in patients with asthma in natural Treg cells. Inhibition of PIM2 attenuated asthma symptoms, and improved AHR and airway inflammation compared with asthmatic mice without inhibition of PIM2. In addition, expression levels of interleukin (IL)10 and forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) in BALF were increased following PIM2 inhibition (IL10, 470.3+/-21.78 vs. 533.7+/-25.55 pg/ml, P<0.05; FOXP3, 259+/-4.68 vs. 279.3+/-3.68 pg/ml; asthma and PIM2 inhibition groups, respectively; P<0.05). In conclusion, PIM2 may exhibit an important role in asthma pathogenesis and exacerbate AHR, airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. These effects of PIM2 may be dependent on Treg cells and the secretion of IL10 by Tregs. The results of the present study suggest that PIM2 may be a potential target molecule for asthma treatment.",,,,PMC5865883,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sodium-hydrogen antiporter 1 (NHE1) is established to serve a role in metastasis and drug resistance in numerous types of cancer; however, the function of NHE1 in T-ALL remains to be elucidated. Previously, the C-C-motif chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) was identified to be involved in metastasis and drug resistance in the MOLT4 T-ALL cell line, as was the ezrin protein. The present study investigated the role of NHE1 in the metastasis of T-ALL using a Transwell assay and scanning electron microscopy, using MOLT4 cells as a model. The association between NHE1 and ezrin was assessed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The effect of NHE1 on resistance to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) was also investigated using a cell viability and cytotoxicity assay. Expression of NHE1 increased following treatment with CCL25, accompanied by morphological changes in MOLT4 cells and the co-localization of NHE1 with ezrin. In addition, wild-type MOLT4 cells exhibited an increased polarization ability compared with NHE1- or ezrin-silenced cells. NHE1- or ezrin-silenced cells exhibited higher sensitivity to DOX compared with wild-type MOLT4 cells. In conclusion, the increased expression or activity of NHE1 may potentially be a poor prognostic indicator for human T-ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['C-C-motif chemokine ligand 25', 'MOLT-4 cells', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'ezrin', 'polarization', 'sodium-hydrogen antiporter 1']",PMC5592868,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microarray dataset GSE7473, containing HNF1alpha-mutated HCA and their corresponding non-tumor livers, 5 HNF1alpha-mutated HCA and 4 non-related non-tumor livers, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The DNA methylation profile GSE43091, consisting of 50 HCA and 4 normal liver tissues, was also downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the limma package of R. A t-test was conducted on the differentially methylated sites. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed through the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis. The genes corresponding to the differentially methylated sites were obtained by the annotation files of methylation chip platform. A total of 182 DEGs and 3,902 differentially methylated sites were identified in HCA. In addition, 238 enriched GO terms, including organic acid metabolic process and carboxylic acid metabolic process, and 14 KEGG pathways, including chemical carcinogenesis, were identified. Furthermore, 12 DEGs were identified to contain differentially methylated sites, among which, 8 overlapped genes, including pregnancy zone protein and solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1), exhibited inverse associations between gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels. The DNA methylation levels may be potential targets of HCA. The present study revealed that the 8 overlapped genes, including annexin A2, chitinase 3-like 1, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, mal, T-cell differentiation protein like, palladin, cytoskeletal associated protein, plasmalemma vesicle associated protein and SLC22A1, may be potential therapeutic targets of HCA.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DAVID', 'differentially expressed genes', 'differentially methylated sites', 'hepatocellular adenoma']",PMC5605960,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell-based immunotherapies have already successfully entered for clinical trials, but limitations due to immune escape mechanisms were identified. Therefore, we extended our established NK cell protocol by integration of the previously investigated powerful trispecific immunoligand ULBP2-aCD19-aCD33 [the so-called triplebodies (TBs)] to improve the anti-leukemic specificity of activated NK cells. IL-2-driven expansion led to strongly elevated natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) expressions on donor NK cells which promote the binding to ULBP2(+) TBs. Similarly, CD33 expression on these NK cells could be detected. Dual-specific targeting and elimination were investigated against the B-cell precursor leukemia cell line BV-173 and patient blasts, which were positive for myeloid marker CD33 and B lymphoid marker CD19 exclusively presented on biphenotypic B/myeloid leukemia's. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated improved killing properties of NK cells pre-coated with TBs compared to untreated controls. Specific NKG2D blocking on those NK cells in response to TBs diminished this killing activity. On the contrary, the observed upregulation of surface CD33 on about 28.0% of the NK cells decreased their viability in response to TBs during cytotoxic interaction of effector and target cells. Similar side effects were also detected against CD33(+) T- and CD19(+) B-cells. Very preliminary proof of principle results showed promising effects using NK cells and TBs against primary leukemic cells. In summary, we demonstrated a promising strategy for redirecting primary human NK cells in response to TBs against leukemia, which may lead to a future progress in NK cell-based immunotherapies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD19', '*CD33', '*ULBP2', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*immunoligands', '*natural killer cells', '*natural killer group 2 member D', '*triplebodies']",PMC5596090,,,,,,,,,,['Front Immunol. 2018 Oct 08;9:2326.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged (MLLr) infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (iMLLr-B-ALL) has a dismal prognosis and is associated with a pro-B/mixed phenotype, therapy refractoriness and frequent central nervous system (CNS) disease/relapse. Neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) is specifically expressed in MLLr leukemias and is used in leukemia immunophenotyping because of its predictive value for MLLr acute leukemias. NG2 is involved in melanoma metastasis and brain development; however, its role in MLL-mediated leukemogenesis remains elusive. Here we evaluated whether NG2 distinguishes leukemia-initiating/propagating cells (L-ICs) and/or CNS-infiltrating cells (CNS-ICs) in iMLLr-B-ALL. Clinical data from the Interfant cohort of iMLLr-B-ALL demonstrated that high NG2 expression associates with lower event-free survival, higher number of circulating blasts and more frequent CNS disease/relapse. Serial xenotransplantation of primary MLL-AF4(+) leukemias indicated that NG2 is a malleable marker that does not enrich for L-IC or CNS-IC in iMLLr-B-All. However, NG2 expression was highly upregulated in blasts infiltrating extramedullar hematopoietic sites and CNS, and specific blockage of NG2 resulted in almost complete loss of engraftment. Indeed, gene expression profiling of primary blasts and primografts revealed a migratory signature of NG2(+) blasts. This study provides new insights on the biology of NG2 in iMLLr-B-ALL and suggests NG2 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce the risk of CNS disease/relapse and to provide safer CNS-directed therapies for iMLLr-B-ALL.",,,,PMC5843903,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2018 Oct;32(10):2306.

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"Chromosomal translocations - leading to the expression of fusion genes - are well-studied genetic abberrations associated with the development of leukemias. Most of them represent altered transcription factors that affect transcription or epigenetics, while others - like BCR-ABL - are enhancing signaling. BCR-ABL has become the prototype for rational drug design, and drugs like Imatinib and subsequently improved drugs have a great impact on cancer treatments. By contrast, MLL-translocations in acute leukemia patients are hard to treat, display a high relapse rate and the overall survival rate is still very poor. Therefore, new treatment modalities are urgently needed. Based on the molecular insights of the most frequent MLL rearrangements, BET-, DOT1L-, SET- and MEN1/LEDGF-inhibitors have been developed and first clinical studies were initiated. Not all results of these studies have are yet available, however, a first paper reports a failure in the DOT1L-inhibitor study although it was the most promising drug based on literature data. One possible explanation is that all of the above mentioned drugs also target the cognate wildtype proteins. Here, we want to strengthen the fact that efforts should be made to develop drugs or strategies to selectively inhibit only the fusion proteins. Some examples will be given that follow exactly this guideline, and proof-of-concept experiments have already demonstrated their feasibility and effectiveness. Some of the mentioned approaches were using drugs that are already on the market, indicating that there are existing opportunities for the future which should be implemented in future therapy strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Epub 2017 Oct 3.,"INTRODUCTION: Over the last few years, several new synthetic drugs, particularly Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and BCL-2 inhibitors have been developed and investigated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Areas covered: This review highlights key aspects of BTK, PI3K and BCL-2 inhibitors that are currently at various stages of preclinical and clinical development in CLL. A literature review of the MEDLINE database for articles in English concerning CLL, B-cell receptor, BCL-2 antagonists, BTK inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors, was conducted via PubMed. Publications from 2000 through July 2017 were scrutinized. The search terms used were acalabrutinib, ACP-196, BGB-3111, ONO-4059, GS-4059, duvelisib, IPI-145, TGR-1202, copanlisib, Bay 80-6946, buparlisib, BKM-120, BCL-2 inhibitors, venetoclax, ABT-263, navitoclax, CDK inhibitors, alvocidib, flavopiridol, dinaciclib, SCH 727,965, palbociclib, PD-0332991, in conjunction with CLL. Conference proceedings from the previous five years of the ASH and EHA Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. Expert opinion: The use of new synthetic drugs is a promising strategy for the treatment of CLL. Data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of new drugs in the treatment of CLL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'BCL-2 antagonist', 'BTK inhibitor', 'CLL', 'PI3K inhibitor', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 6.,"Mutations that target the ubiquitous process of ribosome assembly paradoxically cause diverse tissue-specific disorders (ribosomopathies) that are often associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ribosomes are the essential macromolecular machines that read the genetic code in all cells in all kingdoms of life. Following pre-assembly in the nucleus, precursors of the large 60S and small 40S ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm where the final steps in maturation are completed. Here, I review the recent insights into the conserved mechanisms of ribosome assembly that have come from functional characterisation of the genes mutated in human ribosomopathies. In particular, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy, coupled with genetic, biochemical and prior structural data, have revealed that the SBDS protein that is deficient in the inherited leukaemia predisposition disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome couples the final step in cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation to a quality control assessment of the structural and functional integrity of the nascent particle. Thus, study of this fascinating disorder is providing remarkable insights into how the large ribosomal subunit is functionally activated in the cytoplasm to enter the actively translating pool of ribosomes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author.

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"Although mutations in RNA splicing genes occur frequently in patients with clonal cytopenias of unknown significance (CCUS) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), very often additional common myeloid gene driver mutations are present at diagnosis. Thus, the clinical significance of isolated mutations in the most commonly mutated RNA splicing genes remains unknown. Here we report five unusual patients with an isolated mutation causing a loss of function of ZRSR2, a protein required for recognition of a functional 3' splice site. Two of the patients had a diagnosis of CCUS and three patients had an MDS disorder characterized by low risk features and absence of complex cytogenetic abnor-malities. Notably, all five cases were characterized predominantly by macrocytic anemia. In addition, one CCUS patient followed for more than 15 years with a transfusion dependent macrocytic anemia was found to have an inactivating ZRSR2 mutation with an allele frequency of >60%. We conclude that the common clinical features of patients with an isolated mutation of ZRSR2 are a macrocytic anemia without leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or an increase in marrow blast percentage. At least in some cases, the presence of an isolated ZRSR2 mutation can accompany a dominant hematopoietic clone with a low risk for transformation to frank dysplasia or acute leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are selective therapies for the patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Imatinib and ponatinib have remarkable long-term efficacy on a major molecular response. Although TKI related induction of cytotoxicity and apoptosis have been clearly investigated in molecular levels, their comparative effect on autophagy and miRNome are largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of alterations of miRNA expressions in CML progression, and how imatinib and ponatinib affect this process, by comparing CML, imatinib-resistant CML and leukemia stem cells (LSC). Cytotoxicity analysis was conducted by WST-1, apoptosis was evaluated by AnnexinV, autophagy was analyzed by Tb/GFP TR-FRET LC3B assay and changes in miRNomes were evaluated with microarray method. Ponatinib showed higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis at far fewer concentrations than imatinib. Both imatinib and ponatinib was able to trigger autophagy in imatinib-resistant K562ima3 cell line but not in LSC. We pointed that imatinib and ponatinib caused significant miRNA profile alterations, especially in the expressions of miR-214-pre, miR-218, miR-19a-5p, miR-19b-1-5p, miR-27b-pre, miR-23b-pre, miR-320e, miR-200a-pre, miR-508-3p, miR-33-pre and miR-766. This study is the first comparative miRNome analysis of CML, resistant CML and LSCs following the imatinib or ponatinib treatment and may guide to identify new markers for diagnosis, follow-up of the disease and to develop novel therapeutic strategies if supported by preclinical studies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHOD: Gene expression levels were measured on cDNA by RT-qPCR from diagnostic bone marrow samples of 275 intensively treated adult AML patients (median age, 48 years). RESULTS: KMT2C ELs were significantly lower in abn7q/-7 (P = .001), whereas SPRY4 ELs were not associated with abn5q/-5. Higher KMT2C and SPRY4 ELs were significantly associated with lower genetic risk groups as defined by the European LeukemiaNet classification. Additionally, KMT2C ELs were lower in cytogenetically normal patients with DNMT3A (P = .01) or FLT3-ITD mutations (P = .05). KMT2C ELs were not associated with prognosis, whereas higher SPRY4 ELs showed a favorable impact on event-free (EFS, P = .01), relapse-free (RFS, P = .01) and in-trend on overall survival (P = .06) for cytogenetically abnormal patients, which was confirmed in multivariable analysis for EFS (HR, 0.84; 95%-CI, 0.73-0.97; P = .02) and RFS (HR, 0.85; 95%-CI, 0.73-0.98; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that KMT2C ELs are associated with specific genetic features and that SPRY4 ELs may add prognostic information.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"BACKGROUND: Infant leukaemia (IL) is extremely rare with fewer than 150 cases occurring each year in the United States. Little is known about its causes. However, recent evidence supports a role of de novo mutations in IL aetiology. Parental age has been associated with several adverse outcomes in offspring, including childhood cancers. Given the role of older parental age in de novo mutations in offspring, we carried out an analysis of parental age and IL. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between parental age and IL in a case-control study using registry data from New York, Minnesota, California, Texas, and Washington. Records from 402 cases [219 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 131 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and 52 other] and 45 392 controls born during 1981-2004 were analysed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Estimates were adjusted for infant sex, birth year category, maternal race, state, and mutually adjusted for paternal or maternal age, respectively. RESULTS: Infants with mothers' age >/=40 years had an increased risk of developing AML (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.80, 12.76). In contrast, paternal age <20 was associated with increased risk of ALL (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.62, 8.41). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increased risk of infant ALL in relation to young paternal age. Given record linkage, there is little concern with recall or selection bias, although data are lacking on MLL gene status and other potentially important variables. Parent of origin effects, de novo mutations, and/or carcinogenic exposures may be involved in IL aetiology.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*epidemiology', '*infant leukaemia', '*maternal age', '*paternal age']",PMC5901723,"['N01 CN005230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000783/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS951654'],,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 19.,"The prevalence of liver dysfunction and its association with outcomes in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unknown. Newly diagnosed (<12 months) previously untreated CLL patients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN between 9/1993 and 4/2016 who had baseline assessment of at least one liver function test (LFT) were included in this analysis. The prevalence of liver dysfunction at baseline, proportion of patients who acquired LFT abnormalities, time to first therapy (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. An abnormal LFT was present in 82/2336 (3.5%) patients at diagnosis and was associated with advanced Rai stage (Rai III-IV) (21% vs. 6%; P < .001), lower hemoglobin (13.1 g/dL vs. 13.9 g/dL; P < .001), and lower platelet count (187 x 109/L vs. 200 x 109/L; P = .03). Additionally, 236 patients with normal LFTs at diagnosis developed acquired liver dysfunction during follow-up. Patients with abnormal LFTs at diagnosis had a shorter OS compared to those with normal LFTs (HR 1.80 95% CI 1.13-2.87; P = .014, adjusted for age, sex, Rai stage, and treatment), although TTFT was not different. Of 52 patients who underwent a liver biopsy, CLL was present in liver tissue in 39/52 (73%) patients, with the portal tracts the most common region involved. Histopathology findings of liver involvement by CLL had limited correlation with choice of CLL therapy. In conclusion, approximately 1 of 25 newly diagnosed CLL patients has abnormal LFTs at diagnosis. Although the TTFT was not different among patients with abnormal LFTs, these patients have a shorter OS compared to those with normal LFTs.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,PMC7219181,['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1583089'],,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy characterized by rapid clonal proliferation of myeloid precursors, which can result in hyperleukocytosis. Leukapheresis can be used to rapidly reduce the white blood cell count (WBC). However, the only FDA cleared device for WBC depletion, the COBE Spectra, will no longer be supported by the manufacturer in 2017, and there are few studies comparing different methods of leukapheresis. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old African American female was admitted to the hospital for relapse of her AML. Laboratory data demonstrated a WBC count of 291 600/muL and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood demonstrated 85% myeloid blasts. Leukapheresis was ordered to help treat the leukostasis. METHODS: Three different apheresis protocols were used to achieve cytoreduction: Spectra Optia mononuclear collection (MNC) protocol, Spectra Optia granulocyte collection (PMN) protocol, and Therakos CELLEX buffy coat collection without return. Due to different inlet flow rates, the procedures were evaluated based on the number of WBCs collected and volume of blood processed (VBP). RESULTS: The Spectra Optia PMN collected the most WBCs and collected nearly as many WBCs per VBP as the Therakos CELLEX, which had the highest value. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we are reporting the first use of Therakos CELLEX and Spectra Optia PMN protocol for WBC depletion. While the Spectra Optia granulocyte protocol showed the best performance for this AML patient, further studies will be needed to compare the Spectra Optia PMN protocol to the MNC protocol for AML patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytoreduction', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'leukapheresis', 'leukostasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors identified as independent predictors of ED varied among published studies. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence, causes, and prognostic factors of ED in a series of 216 patients with newly diagnosed APL who received arsenic trioxide (ATO) as induction therapy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of clinical factors with overall ED, hemorrhagic ED, death within 7 days, and death within 8-30 days. In total, 35 EDs (16.2%) occurred that were caused by hemorrhage, differentiation syndrome (DS), infection, and other causes, in order of prevalence. The independent prognostic factors for overall ED and death within 8-30 days were the same and included serum creatinine level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, sex, and fibrinogen level. The risk factors for hemorrhagic ED and death within 7 days were similar and included serum creatinine level, ECOG score, and white blood cell count, while hemorrhagic ED was also associated with D-dimer.

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"Purpose: Radotinib is a second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved in Korea for chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) in patients newly diagnosed or with insufficient response to other TKIs. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radotinib as first-line therapy for CML-CP.Experimental Design: This multinational, open-label study assigned patients (1:1:1) to one of two twice-daily radotinib doses, or imatinib daily. The primary endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months.Results: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized to receive radotinib 300 mg (n = 79) or 400 mg twice-daily (n = 81), or imatinib 400 mg daily (n = 81). MMR rates by 12 months were higher in patients receiving radotinib 300 mg (52%) or radotinib 400 mg twice-daily (46%) versus imatinib (30%; P = 0.0044 and P = 0.0342, respectively). Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates by 12 months were higher for radotinib 300 mg (91%) versus imatinib (77%; P = 0.0120). Early molecular response at 3 months occurred in 86% and 87% of patients receiving radotinib 300 mg and radotinib 400 mg, respectively, and 71% of those receiving imatinib. By 12 months, no patients had progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis. Most adverse events were manageable with dose reduction.Conclusions: Radotinib demonstrated superiority over imatinib in CCyR and MMR in patients newly diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML-CP.

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"Of the six members of the COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) family of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferases identified in mammals, Set1A has been shown to be essential for early embryonic development and the maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Like its familial relatives, Set1A possesses a catalytic SET domain responsible for histone H3K4 methylation. Whether H3K4 methylation by Set1A/COMPASS is required for ESC maintenance and during differentiation has not yet been addressed. Here, we generated ESCs harboring the deletion of the SET domain of Set1A (Set1A(DeltaSET)); surprisingly, the Set1A SET domain is dispensable for ESC proliferation and self-renewal. The removal of the Set1A SET domain does not diminish bulk H3K4 methylation in ESCs; instead, only a subset of genomic loci exhibited reduction in H3K4me3 in Set1A(DeltaSET) cells, suggesting a role for Set1A independent of its catalytic domain in ESC self-renewal. However, Set1A(DeltaSET) ESCs are unable to undergo normal differentiation, indicating the importance of Set1A-dependent H3K4 methylation during differentiation. Our data also indicate that during differentiation, Set1A but not Mll2 functions as the H3K4 methylase on bivalent genes and is required for their expression, supporting a model for transcriptional switch between Mll2 and Set1A during the self-renewing-to-differentiation transition. Together, our study implicates a critical role for Set1A catalytic methyltransferase activity in regulating ESC differentiation but not self-renewal and suggests the existence of context-specific H3K4 methylation that regulates transcriptional outputs during ESC pluripotency.",['(c) 2017 Sze et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*COMPASS', '*H3K4 methylation', '*Set1A', '*differentiation', '*pluripotency', '*self-renewal']",PMC5666672,"['R35 CA197569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted in a 4500-bed university hospital in northwest China. To collect data, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with parents of children with acute leukaemia (n=12) and haemato-oncology paediatricians (n=11) using purposive sampling. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: The suffering of procedural pain among paediatric patients was not adequately recognised and properly treated at the paediatric haemato-oncology department. The current paediatric procedural pain management is inadequate for paediatric patients. Crucial factors were identified including lack of awareness about the damage of uncontrolled pain in children, parents' low supportive ability, the limited capacity to provide general analgesia by anaesthetists, inadequate knowledge in the usage of analgesia and sedation and lack of efficient analgesic for children's procedural pain. The participants strongly expected optimal interventions to improve paediatric procedural pain management.

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"Patients with t(16;21) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who receive chemotherapy have poor outcomes. The treatment efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) must be identified, and the usefulness of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring requires evaluation. Fourteen consecutive patients with t(16;21) AML undergoing allo-HSCT at our institution were included in this study. Translocation liposarcoma- ETS-related gene (TLS-ERG) transcript levels were serially monitored for a median of 15 months (range, 3-51 months) after allo-HSCT. Eight patients relapsed, 7 patients died from relapse-related causes, and 1 patient died from a non-relapse-related cause. The 2-year cumulative incidence rates of relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival after HSCT were 66.2%, 30.8%, and 46.2%, respectively. Of the 3 patients who received an HLA-matched sibling transplant, 2 relapsed, and 1 (33.3%) was in hematologic complete remission (CR) but died of nonrelapse mortality, whereas 5 of 11 patients (45.5%) who received haploidentical transplantation were in CR and were alive. Two of 6 patients with undetectable TLS-ERG at the time of allo-HSCT relapsed, at 14 and 15 months, and 3 of 4 PCR-positive patients relapsed, at a median of 10 months after HSCT. Four patients with continually low post-HSCT TLS-ERG levels (mostly <.01%) remained alive and in CR. The TLS-ERG levels of all 8 patients who relapsed were significantly increased before the relapse, exceeding 1.0% in all 7 patients who experienced hematologic relapse. In total, 7 patients received modified donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and 1 patient received IFN-alpha. All 7 patients with a TLS-ERG level >5.0% at the time of intervention experienced an increase or a brief decrease in TLS-ERG level, followed by an increase, and 6 relapsed, whereas the TLS-ERG level of 1 patient with a TLS-ERG level <1.0% at intervention decreased to undetectable. Therefore, t(16;21) AML is an indication for allo-HSCT. Among the HSCT recipients, 30.8% responded to treatment with CR. TLS-ERG transcript levels reflect MRD and might predict relapse and guide effective intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"The outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myeloid malignancies is better in those without minimal residual disease (MRD) than in those with MRD+, as assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC). WT1 quantitation also has been used to assess the probability of relapse in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated with chemotherapy. We analyzed the clinical value of normalized bone marrow WT1 levels as a measure of the expanded myeloid progenitor compartment in a consecutive series of 193 adult patients with myeloid malignancies who underwent HCT. Bone marrow WT1 levels before the HCT, at the first bone marrow aspirate after infusion, and in the follow-up samples after HCT were determined by means of real-time PCR using the European LeukemiaNet normalized method. We sought to clarify the prognostic relevance in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Based on earlier experience in AML, we selected a threshold of 100 copies, defining 2 groups: patients with <100 WT1 copies and those with >/=100 copies. Patients with <100 WT1 copies before HCT (median time, 36 days; range, 4 to 268 days) had a better OS, PFS, and CIR than those with >/=100 copies (40 +/- 1 versus 29 +/- 6 days, P = .004; 35 +/- 9 versus 26 +/- 6 days, P = .002; and 29 +/- 7 versus 37 +/- 6 days, P = .051). In the first bone marrow study after the HCT (median time, 42 days; range 14 to 157 days, respectively), patients with <100 WT1 copies also had better outcomes in terms of OS, PFS, and CIR (40 +/- 7 versus 31 +/- 9 days, P = .025; 36 +/- 7 versus 30 +/- 8 days, P = .004; and 29 +/- 6 days versus 54 +/- 9, P < .001, respectively). At this time point, bone marrrow samples with >100 copies also included patients who were negative for MRD as assessed by MPFC (19 of 32). During the HCT follow-up, patients with sustained WT1 levels <100 copies showed a marked benefit in terms of OS, PFS, and CIR even compared with those with only a single measurement >100 copies (mean, 68 +/- 11 versus 26 +/- 7 days, P < .001; 63 +/- 11 versus 20 +/- 8 days, P < .001; and 20 +/- 8 vs. 71 +/- 8 days, P < .001, respectively). Standardized bone marrow WT1 levels using a 100-copy threshold in samples obtained before HCT, at leukocyte recovery, and during follow-up provided relevant prognostic information in patients with myeloid malignacies submitted to HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To better understand this phenomenon, the blood samples of 25 AML patients and 25 healthy blood donors were examined. The serological ABO blood types of the patients were determined in different AML stages, and gene sequencing was performed to identify the precise ABO genotypes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out to detect the transcription levels of the antigens. The genotyping result showed that there were 4 patients with genotype A(1)O, 5 patients with B(1)O, and 16 patients with A(1)B(1). RT-PCR results indicated that the transcription levels of the ABO gene in 76% (19/25) of the patients were significantly lower compared with those in controls (p <0.05). After therapy, 3/4 patients with A(1)O returned to normal A, 4/5 patients with B(1)O returned to normal B, and 10/16 patients with A(1)B(1) returned to normal AB. The patients who achieved complete remission (CR) showed no difference of transcription levels of the ABO gene from those of controls. The data indicated that the transcription levels of the ABO gene changed with the disease progression, suggesting its potential role in the progression of AML disease.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"Protein kinase C (PKC)-eta (PKCeta) is a member of the novel category of PKC family. It is overexpressed in breast cancer and was shown to inhibit apoptosis and contribute to chemoresistance. Since the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) plays an important role in breast cancer cell survival and chemoresistance, we investigated if PKCeta regulates Mcl-1 level. Silencing of PKCeta decreased Mcl-1 in several breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 and T47D cells. PKCeta depletion had no effect on MCL1 mRNA but the decrease in Mcl-1 by PKCeta knockdown was blocked by proteasomal inhibitors, such as MG132 and lactacystin. Moreover, knockdown of Mule (Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase) prevented Mcl-1 downregulation caused by PKCeta deficiency. Overexpression of catalytically-active Akt or knockdown of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)-beta, a substrate for Akt, had little effect on Mcl-1 downregulation caused by PKCeta silencing. However, knockdown of PKCeta but not PKCalpha, -delta or -epsilon caused a significant decrease in ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. Knockdown of ERK1 but not ERK2 decreased Mcl-1 level, and the decrease in Mcl-1 caused by PKCeta knockdown was restored by ERK1 overexpression. These results suggest that PKCeta utilizes the ERK signaling pathway to protect against ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"The Cdc28 protein kinase subunits, Cks1 and Cks2, play dual roles in Cdk-substrate specificity and Cdk-independent protein degradation, in concert with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes SCF(Skp2) and APC(Cdc20). Notable targets controlled by Cks include p27 and Cyclin A. Here, we demonstrate that Cks1 and Cks2 proteins interact with both the Mll(N) and Mll(C) subunits of Mll1 (Mixed-lineage leukaemia 1), and together, the Cks proteins define Mll1 levels throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of CKS1B and CKS2 is observed in multiple human cancers, including various MLL-rearranged (MLLr) AML subtypes. To explore the importance of MLL-Fusion Protein regulation by CKS1/2, we used small molecule inhibitors (MLN4924 and C1) to modulate their protein degradation functions. These inhibitors specifically reduced the proliferation of MLLr cell lines compared to primary controls. Altogether, this study uncovers a novel regulatory pathway for MLL1, which may open a new therapeutic approach to MLLr leukaemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Early identification of patients at risk of SOS/VOD may possibly improve the outcome and reduce mortality. Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is global assay allowing for the precise assessment of both bleeding and thrombotic conditions, however, its usefulness in patients undergoing HSCT for acute leukaemia has not been studied. We evaluated the thromboelastometry parameters in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for acute leukaemia to identify candidate biomarkers of SOS/VOD occurrence. ROTEM assays (INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM, APTEM) were performed on day -10, on the day of stem cell infusion (day 0) and on days +12 and +28 post-HSCT. The diagnosis of SOS/VOD was based on the Baltimore criteria. Seven patients (26%) developed SOS/VOD. On day +12, the patients with SOS/VOD had statistically significant longer INTEM-CT (clotting time, 199 +/- 33.41vs166 +/- 23.65s, p = 0.0033), EXTEM-CT (69.5 +/- 6.39vs.52 +/- 3.42s, p = 0.0139) and FIBTEM-CT (69.5 +/- 22.75vs. 50.8 +/- 14.31s, p = 0.0124) compared to SOS/VOD (-). ROC curve on day +12 indicated a cut-off value of 179s in INTEM-CT (AUC = 0.91), 69s in EXTEM-CT (AUC = 0.90) and 102s in FIBTEM-CT (AUC = 0.82) for the prediction of SOS/VOD. This is the first study evaluating the usefulness of ROTEM assays in the early detection of haemostasis abnormalities predictive of SOS/VOD development in patients undergoing HSCT for acute leukemia. Patients with SOS/VOD had a significant delay in the initiation of thrombin formation in the analysed ROTEM assays. The utility of ROTEM assays in the optimal management of patients undergoing HSCT should be clarified in further prospective studies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'biomarkers', 'sinusoidal obstruction syndrome', 'thromboelastometry']",PMC5601799,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

To circumvent the off-target effects of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, kinase inhibitors are increasingly being used as an adjunct therapy to target leukemia. In this study, we conducted a screen of leukemic cell lines in parallel with primary neutrophils to identify kinase inhibitors with the capacity to induce apoptosis of myeloid and lymphoid cell lines whilst sparing primary mouse and human neutrophils. We have utilized a high-throughput live cell imaging platform to demonstrate that cytotoxic drugs have limited effects on neutrophil viability but are toxic to hematopoietic progenitor cells, with the exception of the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38. The parallel screening of kinase inhibitors revealed that mouse and human neutrophil viability is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity but surprisingly only partially dependent on PI3 kinase and JAK/STAT signaling, revealing dominant pathways contributing to neutrophil viability. Mcl-1 haploinsufficiency sensitized neutrophils to CDK inhibition, demonstrating that Mcl-1 is a direct target for CDK inhibitors. This study reveals a therapeutic window for the kinase inhibitors BEZ235, BMS-3, AZD7762, and (R)-BI-2536 to induce apoptosis of leukemia cell lines whilst maintaining immunocompetence and hemostasis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'hematopoietic progenitor cells', 'kinase inhibitors', 'leukemia', 'neutropenia']",PMC5601625,['R01 HL124209/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no financial conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that in developing T cells, the Bcl11b enhancer repositioned from the lamina to the nuclear interior. Our search for factors that relocalized the Bcl11b enhancer identified a non-coding RNA named ThymoD (thymocyte differentiation factor). ThymoD-deficient mice displayed a block at the onset of T cell development and developed lymphoid malignancies. We found that ThymoD transcription promoted demethylation at CTCF bound sites and activated cohesin-dependent looping to reposition the Bcl11b enhancer from the lamina to the nuclear interior and to juxtapose the Bcl11b enhancer and promoter into a single-loop domain. These large-scale changes in nuclear architecture were associated with the deposition of activating epigenetic marks across the loop domain, plausibly facilitating phase separation.

The most common diagnoses-brain tumors, leukemia-are also associated with increased risk of neurocognitive deficits. Unfortunately, research regarding the functioning of preschool-aged children with cancer is limited. Our objective is to describe the cognitive and psychosocial functioning of preschool-aged children with cancer who completed a clinical evaluation at a hospital-based psychology clinic. METHODS: Assessment data from 98 preschool-aged children with cancer (M = 5.17 years old, SD = 0.54; 54.1% male) who completed clinically referred evaluations from 2011 to 2015 were abstracted. Because of variability in assessment measures used across clinicians, indicators of cognitive, adaptive, preacademic, and emotional/behavioral functioning were collapsed before analyses. RESULTS: Children were 2.56 years from diagnosis (SD = 1.46, range 0-5.25 years) and most were off therapy (79.6%). Primary diagnostic categories were represented: brain tumor (68.4%), solid tumor (15.3%), and leukemia (16.3%). Mean IQ scores were significantly below expectations (t[80] = -7.95, p < .001). There were no differences based on diagnostic category, treatment status, or sex. Adaptive functioning (t[73] = -8.42, p < .001) and preacademic skills (t[77] = -6.20, p < .001) were also significantly below expectations. Mean scores on a measure of parent-reported emotional/behavioral functioning were in the average range. CONCLUSION: Young children with cancer may be at significant risk of deficits in intellectual, adaptive, and preacademic functioning. Although our sample is biased by those who were referred for clinical evaluations, the severity of deficits highlights the potential vulnerability of young patients, even before most have entered formal school. Interventions-such as hospital-based preschool programs to increase preacademic skills-should be designed that explicitly target preschool-aged children and focus on a wide range of domains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skin involvement is exceptionally rare, with <20 cases reported and its presence as the first presentation of CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, as an isolated skin lesion has never been described. Primary cutaneous CD4-positive small/medium T-cell lymphoma (CD4 PCSM-TCL) characteristically presents with a dense dermal infiltrate consisting primarily of small-/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cells and less than 30% large pleomorphic cells. A polymorphous reactive infiltrate composed of B-cells, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils is also found in differing proportions. Because of these morphological characteristics, the differential diagnosis includes not only other forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas but also B-cell lymphomas and reactive lymphoid infiltrates. We report a case of a cutaneous Richter syndrome as the initial manifestation of CLL, mimicking CD4 PCSM-TCL, in a 65-year-old apparently healthy asymptomatic man who presented with a solitary nodule in his arm.

The primary aim of this study was to establish the correlation between these molecular mutations and the clinico-hematologic parameters as well as the prognostic outcome of the Indian acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study involved newly diagnosed nonpromyelocytic AML patients who had undergone complete diagnostic workup, including immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetics and molecular analysis for NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at presentation. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations was found to be 14.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Among patients with normal karyotype, leukocytosis was significantly associated with NPM1+ group than the NPM1- group (P = 0.0019) and more severe degree of anemia was observed in the FLT3-ITD+ patients than the other groups (P = 0.025). No significant correlation was found in terms of age at presentation (P = 0.56), sex ratio (P = 0.467), median platelet count (P = 0.27), and blast percentage between NPM1+ and FLT3-ITD+ groups. Complete remission (CR) rates were better in the NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- group than the other three groups. Unlike most other studies, improved CR rates as well as disease-free survival were observed in the NPM-/FLT3-ITD- group than the FLT3-ITD+ groups although not reaching statistically significant levels. CONCLUSION: Some differences in the clinical behavior of the Indian AML patients in comparison to that of the West in the presence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD suggests that comprehensive studies are required to confirm the definitive role of these mutations among AML patients, especially with normal karyotype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The VW female phantom was used in the simulations. Planning target volume (PTV) was defined in the left breast. The 6MV parallel-opposed fields breast-radiotherapy (RT) protocol was simulated with MCNPx code. The absorbed doses were evaluated in all the organs. The secondary cancer-incidence risk induced by radiotherapy was calculated for different age groups according to the BEIR VII methodology. RESULTS: RT quality indexes indicated that the protocol was properly simulated. Significant absorbed dose values in red bone marrow, RBM (0.8 Gy) and stomach (0.6 Gy) were observed. The contralateral breast presented the highest risk of incidence of a secondary cancer followed by leukaemia, lung and stomach. The risk of a secondary cancer-incidence by breast-RT, for the Brazilian population, ranged between 2.2-1.7% and 0.6-0.4%. CONCLUSION: RBM and stomach, usually not considered as OAR, presented high second cancer incidence risks of 0.5-0.3% and 0.4-0.1%, respectively. This study may be helpful for breast-RT risk/benefit assessment. Advances in knowledge: MCNPX-dosimetry was able to provide the scatter radiation and dose for all body organs in conventional breast-RT. It was found a relevant risk up to 2.2% of induced-cancer from breast-RT, considering the whole thorax organs and Brazilian cancer-incidence.",,,,PMC6047661,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic literature review of CML studies reporting adherence to BCR-ABL inhibitors from the USA, Asia and Europe (19 articles: 9 retrospective, 4 prospective, rest cross-sectional) showed that average adherence varies from 19% to 100% of the proportion of prescribed drug taken.

At the same time, the expression of P-gp, MDR1 mRNA and PI3-K, NF-kappaB were respectively detected through flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western blot and Elisa, and the mouse liver, spleen were examined via histopathological methods. The results of the experiment were as follows: mice of the control group didn't show any obvious changes, while mice of the other six groups all showed arched back, emaciation, liver swell, and inflammation was found in all liver tissue. The expression level of P-gp and PI3K on the LSC membrane of mouse tumor block was down-regulated; the expression of MDR1 mRNA in the cytoplasm was obviously down in the PESV low dose group, and which was inordinately up in the middle dose group and the high dose group. The expression level of NF-kappaB in the leukemia stem cell nucleus remarkably decreased. PESV had a outstanding role of down-regulating PI3K, NF-kappab, MDR1 which were all upstream factors of P-gp, and to a certain degree enhanced the sensitivity of LSC to ADM.

Epub 2017 Sep 22.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), stabilizing mutations of NOTCH1, affecting up to 10-15% of cases, have been associated to poor prognosis, disease progression and refractoriness to chemotherapy. NOTCH1 mutations are significantly overrepresented in trisomy 12 CLL, a disease subset frequently expressing CD49d, the alpha4 chain of the very-late-activation-4 integrin, a well-known key regulator of microenviromental interactions, and negative prognosticator in CLL. In the present study, by analysing a wide cohort of 1180 CLL, we observed a very strong association between the presence of NOTCH1 mutations and the expression of CD49d (P<0.0001), occurring also outside the trisomy 12 CLL subset. Using both the MEC-1 CLL-like cells stably transfected with the NOTCH1 intracellular domain and primary CLL cells bearing a mutated or wild-type NOTCH1 gene configuration, we provide evidence that triggering of the NOTCH1 pathway resulted in a positive CD49d expression regulation, which was driven by a NOTCH1-dependent activation of nuclear factot-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of the NOTCH1 and/or of the NF-kappaB pathways resulted in impaired NF-kappaB nuclear translocation with consequent down-modulation of CD49d expression. Altogether, our data link for the first time NOTCH1 mutations to CD49d expression regulation through the involvement of the NF-kappaB pathway in CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"Randomized trials have conclusively shown higher rates of chronic graft-versus-host disease with filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood as a donor source than unstimulated bone marrow. The Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group conducted a phase 3 study of adults who received either filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood or filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow from human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling donors. Because all donors received the identical filgrastim dosing schedule, this study allowed for a controlled evaluation of the impact of stem cell source on development of chronic graft-versus-host disease. One hundred and twenty-one evaluable filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow patient donor products were immunologically characterized by flow cytometry and tested for their association with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease within 2 years of transplantation. The immune populations evaluated included, regulatory T cells, central memory and effector T cells, interferon gamma positive producing T cells, invariate natural killer T cells, regulatory natural killer cells, dendritic cell populations, macrophages, and activated B cells and memory B cells. When both filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow were grouped together, a higher chronic graft-versus-host disease frequency was associated with lower proportions of CD56(bright) natural killer regulatory cells and interferon gamma-producing T helper cells in the donor product. Lower CD56(bright) natural killer regulatory cells displayed differential impacts on the development of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease between filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood and filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow. In summary, while controlling for the potential impact of filgrastim on marrow, our studies demonstrated that CD56(bright) natural killer regulatory cells had a much stronger impact on filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood than on filgrastim-stimulated bone marrow. This supports the conclusion that a lower proportion of CD56(bright) natural killer regulatory cells results in the high rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease seen in filgrastim-stimulated apheresis peripheral blood. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: 00438958.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5664398,['R01 CA108752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00438958'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) is an investigational immunotherapy that involves reprogramming a patient's own T cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing cells. We previously reported that CTL019 achieved impressive clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including the expansion and persistence of CTL019 cells, which correlates with response to therapy. Here, we performed formal cellular kinetic analyses of CTL019 in a larger cohort of 103 patients treated with CTL019 in 2 different diseases (ALL and CLL). CTL019 was measured in peripheral blood and bone marrow, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. CTL019 levels in peripheral blood typically peaked at 10 to 14 days postinfusion and then declined slowly over time. Patients with complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete count recovery had higher levels of CTL019 in peripheral blood, with greater maximal concentration and area under the curve values compared with nonresponding patients (P < .0001 for each). CTL019 transgene levels were measurable up to 780 days in peripheral blood. CTL019 trafficking and persistence were observed in bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. CTL019 expansion correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and preinfusion tumor burden in pediatric ALL. The results described here are the first detailed formal presentation of cellular kinetics across 2 diseases and highlight the importance of the application of in vivo cellular kinetic analyses to characterize clinical efficacy and CRS severity associated with CTL019 therapy.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC5731220,['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Blood. 2017 Nov 23;130(21):2240.

Sulindac sulfide amide (1) possessing greatly reduced COX-related inhibition relative to sulindac displayed in vivo antitumor activity that was comparable to sulindac in a human colon tumor xenograft model. Inspired by these observations, a panel of diverse sulindac amide derivatives have been synthesized and their activity probed against three cancer cell lines (prostate, colon and breast). A neutral analog, compound 79 was identified with comparable potency relative to lead 1 and activity against a panel of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Several new series also show good activity relative to the parent (1), including five analogs that also possess nanomolar inhibitory potencies against acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if parthenolide (PTL) is cytotoxic for leukemia-like KG1a cells and if it involves in certain molecular-mediated resistance, especially osteopontin (OPN). METHODS: PTL/daunorubicin (DNR)-treated KG1a cells were examined for viability using MTT and colony-formation assay, and stained for apoptosis using AV/PI. The gene and protein expression were evaluated by qReal-time PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. OPN gene was inhibited by OPN siRNA. The cells were stained for various fractions using PE anti-CD34, FITC anti-CD38 and PerCP anti-CD123. RESULTS: Cell viability and proliferation assay exhibited KG1a cells are relatively refractory to used concentrations of PTL. OPN mRNA and protein levels increased in response to PTL. Suppression of OPN with siRNA increased the cytotoxic effects of PTL on KG1a cells. PTL treatment and OPN siRNA suppression in KG1a cells resulted in a decrease of mRNA expression of AKT, mTOR, beta-catenin, and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The sub-population cells of CD34(+) and CD123(+) from KG1a cells are enriched by PTL treatment. CONCLUSION: Parthenolide in spite of the reduction in gene expression of AKT, mTOR or beta-catenin, stimulates the OPN expression in KG1a cells. The OPN expression pattern in KG1a cells could be compatible with CD34(+)/CD123(+) subtype enrichment by PTL which in turn implies OPN's unique role in resistance of cell populations characterized by CD34(+)/CD123(+) phenotype.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We examined acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients' expressed challenges and supports after intensive induction chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to understand opportunities for palliative care interventions in this population. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study of AML patients with high-risk disease at Duke University Hospital, Durham, NC. Patients were interviewed about care experiences approximately 3 months after treatment initiation. Multiple coders used descriptive content analysis to identify common and recurrent themes. RESULTS: We analyzed 22 patient transcripts. Sample demographics included 10 (45.5%) females, 12 (54.5%) males, mean age 62 (SD 10.9), 19 (86.4%) non-Hispanic white, and three (13.6%) nonwhite/non-Hispanic. All had high-risk disease, by age, relapse status, or molecular markers. We identified four themes in our analysis: physical symptoms, psychological issues, uncertainty regarding prognosis, and patients' sources of support. Specific challenges noted by patients included feelings of helplessness/hopelessness, activity restriction, fatigue, fevers, caregiver stress, and lack of clarity regarding treatment decision making. CONCLUSION: AML patients face substantial challenges regarding physical symptoms, psychological distress, and uncertainty regarding prognosis. These challenges signal needs for which palliative care in high-risk AML patients may help. Our findings highlight opportunities to develop targeted palliative care interventions addressing unmet needs in AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

PBX3 (Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 3), a putative target gene of miR-320, has been reported to be upregulated in various tumors and promote tumor cell growth through regulating MAKP/ERK pathway. This study aimed to verify whether miR-320 influences glioma cells growth through regulating PBX3. METHODS: Twenty-four human glioma and paired adjacent nontumorous tissues were collected for determination of miR-320 and PBX3 expression using RT-qPCR and western blot assays. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the interaction between miR-320 and its targeting sequence in the 3' UTR of PBX3 in glioma cells U87 and U251. Increased miR-320 level in U87 and U251 cells was achieved through miR-320 mimic transfection and the effect of which on glioma cells growth, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and activation of Raf-1/MAPK pathway was determined using MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry and western blot assays. PBX3 knockdown was performed using shPBX3 and the influence on MAPK pathway activation was evaluated. RESULTS: MiR-320 downregulation and PBX3 upregulation was found in glioma tissues. Luciferase reporter assays identified miR-320 directly blinds to the 3' UTR of PBX3 in glioma cells. MiR-320 mimic transfection suppressed glioma cells proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both miR-320 overexpression and PBX3 knockdown inhibited Raf-1/MAPK activation. CONCLUSION: MiR-320 may suppress glioma cells growth and induced apoptosis through the PBX3/Raf-1/MAPK axis, and miR-320 oligonucleotides may be a potential cancer therapeutic for glioma.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Glioma', 'Luciferase reporter assay', 'MiR-320', 'PBX3']",PMC5609034,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The absolute count, doubling time and peak time of WBC were analyzed in 64 newly diagnosed non-high-risk APL patients who were treated with different induction regimens containing either oral Realgar-indigo naturalis formula (RIF) (n=35) or ATO (n=29). The end points were the dynamic changes of the WBC counts during induction. The time points started at day 1 and were selected over 3-day intervals for 28days. RESULTS: Among the 64 included patients, the median initial and peak WBC counts were 1.78x10(9)/L (range 0.31-9.89) and 12.16x10(9)/L (range 1.56-80.01), respectively. The incidence of differentiation syndrome was 9.38%. The dynamic changes in leukocytosis showed a single peak wave in all the patients, and the median time to peak was 10 (range 2-26) days. A higher WBC count was observed in the RIF group than in the ATO group after 10days of treatment (9.22x10(9)/L vs. 4.10x10(9)/L, p=0.015). Patients with the peak WBC count >10x10(9)/L had a shorter WBC doubling time compared to patients with a lower peak WBC (RIF group 4days vs. 7days, p=0.001; ATO group 4.5days vs. 23days, p=0.002). Univariate and multivariable analyses showed that the doubling time of WBC is an independent factor for the peak WBC count. CONCLUSION: Different kinetics of WBC proliferation were observed during induction with oral arsenic plus ATRA and ATO plus ATRA. The doubling time of WBC is an important independent factor for predicting the peak WBC count.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The cell line was isolated from the blood sample of myeloid NK cell acute leukemia patients and extensively characterized by flow cytometery, morphology, and cytogentic analysis. Cytotoxicity by standard chemotherapeutic drugs was also examined. As characterized by Giemsa staining, the predominant cell type in the culture had high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. Cytogenetic analysis revealed high chromosome instability and structural abnormalities confirming the source of cell line from a patient with AML. The karyotype of the isolated cells did not alter up to around 40 passages. These AML-004 cells lacked specific markers for B and T lymphoid cells, but expressed surface receptors for lymphoid/NK cells. Cells also lacked the presence of early progenitors. The proliferation of the isolated cells was inversely proportional to the IL-2 concentration confirming presence of NK phenotype. AML-004 was resistant against standard chemotherapeutic drugs excluding cisplatin. Thus, AML-004 cells provide a continuous source of human cells for designing novel therapies for patients with T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We have developed a bioinformatic workflow to generate a chromatin space that allows to classify 42 human healthy blood epigenomes from the BLUEPRINT, NIH ROADMAP and ENCODE consortia by their cell type. This approach let us to distinguish different cells types based on their epigenomic profiles, thus recapitulating important aspects of human hematopoiesis. The analysis of the orthogonal dimension of the chromatin space identify 32,662 chromatin determinant regions (CDRs), genomic regions with different epigenetic characteristics between the cell types. Functional analysis revealed that these regions are linked with cell identities. The inclusion of leukemia epigenomes in the healthy hematological chromatin sample space gives us insights on the healthy cell types that are more epigenetically similar to the disease samples. Further analysis of tumoral epigenetic alterations in hematopoietic CDRs points to sets of genes that are tightly regulated in leukemic transformations and commonly mutated in other tumors. Our method provides an analytical approach to study the relationship between epigenomic changes and cell lineage differentiation.

Although improvements in infectious disease prophylaxis, immunosuppressive treatments, supportive care, and molecular based tissue typing have contributed to enhanced outcomes, acute graft-versus-host disease and other transplant related complications still contribute to high mortality and significantly limit the more widespread use of HSCT. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a zwitterionic lysophospholipid that has been implicated as a crucial signaling regulator in many physiological and pathophysiological processes including multiple cell types such as macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, T regulatory cells and endothelial cells. Recent data suggested important roles for S1P signaling in engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), GvL and other processes that occur during and after HSCT.

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), primarily expressed in activated mature B lymphocytes in germinal centers, is the key factor in adaptive immune response against foreign antigens. AID is responsible for producing high-affinity and high-specificity antibodies against an infectious agent, through the physiological DNA alteration processes of antibody genes by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) and functions by deaminating deoxycytidines (dC) to deoxyuridines (dU), thereby introducing point mutations and double-stranded chromosomal breaks (DSBs). The beneficial physiological role of AID in antibody diversification is outweighed by its detrimental role in the genesis of several chronic immune diseases, under non-physiological conditions. This review offers a comprehensive and better understanding of AID biology and its pathological aspects, as well as addresses the challenges involved in AID-related cancer therapeutics, based on various recent advances and evidence available in the literature till date. In this article, we discuss ways through which our interpretation of AID biology may reflect upon novel clinical insights, which could be successfully translated into designing clinical trials and improving patient prognosis and disease management.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)', '*chromosomal translocations', '*class-switch recombination (CSR)', '*lymphoma', '*somatic hypermutation (SHM)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"Xenotransplantation is frequently used to study normal and malignant hematopoiesis of human cells. However, conventional mouse xenotransplantation models lack essential human-specific bone-marrow (BM)-microenvironment-derived survival, proliferation, and self-renewal signals for engraftment of normal and malignant blood cells. As a consequence, many human leukemias and other hematologic disorders do not robustly engraft in these conventional models. Here, we describe a complete workflow for the generation of humanized ossicles with an accessible BM microenvironment that faithfully recapitulates normal BM niche morphology and function. The ossicles, therefore, allow for accelerated and superior engraftment of primary patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematologic malignancies such as myelofibrosis (MF) in mice. The humanized ossicles are formed by in situ differentiation of BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Human hematopoietic cells can subsequently be transplanted directly into the ossicle marrow space or by intravenous injection. Using this method, a humanized engraftable BM microenvironment can be formed within 6-10 weeks. Engraftment of human hematopoietic cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry 8-16 weeks after transplantation. This protocol describes a robust and reproducible in vivo methodology for the study of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis in a more physiologic setting.",,,,PMC5898606,"['J 3358/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'R01 CA188055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL099999/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['EMS77094'],,,,,,,

We assessed co-occurring mutations, response to therapy, and clinical outcomes in patients with and without mutant RUNX1 (mRUNX1); (2) We analyzed 328 AML patients, including 177 patients younger than 65 years who received intensive chemotherapy and 151 patients >65 years who received hypomethylating agents. RUNX1 and co-existing mutations were identified using next-generation sequencing; (3) RUNX1 mutations were identified in 5.1% of younger patients and 15.9% of older patients, and were significantly associated with increasing age (p = 0.01) as well as intermediate-risk cytogenetics including normal karyotype (p = 0.02) in the elderly cohort, and with lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; p = 0.02) and higher platelet count (p = 0.012) overall. Identified co-occurring mutations were primarily ASXL1 mutations in older patients and RAS mutations in younger patients; FLT3-ITD and IDH1/2 co-mutations were also frequent. Younger mRUNX1 AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy experienced inferior treatment outcomes. In older patients with AML treated with hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy, response and survival was independent of RUNX1 status. Older mRUNX1 patients with prior myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) had particularly dismal outcome.

However, it is not curative and patients develop IM resistance. IM resistance has been previously correlated with the emergence of drug-resistant LIC/LSC (Leukemia Initiating Cell/Leukemia Stem Cell) and increased nuclear catenin levels and enhanced Wnt signaling. It has been demonstrated previously that drug resistant CML LIC/LSC can be safely eliminated both in vitro and in vivo via disruption of the CBP/catenin interaction, utilizing the highly biochemically selective small molecule CBP/catenin antagonist ICG- 001. METHODS: Here, we utilized an in vitro IM selection of primary CML patients' samples to identify drug-resistant LIC/LSC populations. In this report, we characterized the drug-resistant CML LIC/LSC population using FACS, Smartchip qPCR and colony assays to analyze cell surface markers, transcriptomics and function. RESULTS: As opposed to previous characterization of the CML leukemic stem cell population as being either CD34+CD38- or CD34+CD38+, the in vitro selected Imatinib resistant (IM-R) CML LSC population was consistently CD34-CD38-. In Long-Term Culture Initiating Cell assay (LTC-IC, a surrogate assay for long term repopulating stem cells), our results suggest that the CBP/catenin antagonist ICG- 001 sensitizes LIC/LSC to IM treatment by forced differentiative elimination of the CML LIC/LSC population. CONCLUSION: In vitro selected IM resistant cells are negative for both CD34 and CD38 by FACS analysis. These cells acquire CD34/CD38 expression after co-culture with stromal cells. CBP/catenin antagonist ICG-001 facilitates IM function in eliminating these cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CBP/catenin antagonist', '*ICG-001', '*Imatinib (IM).', '*Leukemia Stem Cell/Leukemia Initiating Cell (LIC/LSC)', '*Wnt']",,"['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112638/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, like any new assay, regulatory applications of HTS need method standardization. Therefore, our three laboratories initiated a study to evaluate performance of HTS for potential detection of viral adventitious agents by spiking model viruses in different cellular matrices to mimic putative materials for manufacturing of biologics. Four model viruses were selected based upon different physical and biochemical properties and commercial availability: human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and human reovirus (REO). Additionally, porcine circovirus (PCV) was tested by one laboratory. Independent samples were prepared for HTS by spiking intact viruses or extracted viral nucleic acids, singly or mixed, into different HeLa cell matrices (resuspended whole cells, cell lysate, or total cellular RNA). Data were obtained using different sequencing platforms (Roche 454, Illumina HiSeq1500 or HiSeq2500). Bioinformatic analyses were performed independently by each laboratory using available tools, pipelines, and databases. The results showed that comparable virus detection was obtained in the three laboratories regardless of sample processing, library preparation, sequencing platform, and bioinformatic analysis: between 0.1 and 3 viral genome copies per cell were detected for all of the model viruses used. This study highlights the potential for using HTS for sensitive detection of adventitious viruses in complex biological samples containing cellular background. IMPORTANCE Recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) investigations have resulted in unexpected discoveries of known and novel viruses in a variety of sample types, including research materials, clinical materials, and biological products. Therefore, HTS can be a powerful tool for supplementing current methods for demonstrating the absence of adventitious or unwanted viruses in biological products, particularly when using a new cell line. However, HTS is a complex technology with different platforms, which needs standardization for evaluation of biologics. This collaborative study was undertaken to investigate detection of different virus types using two different HTS platforms. The results of the independently performed studies demonstrated a similar sensitivity of virus detection, regardless of the different sample preparation and processing procedures and bioinformatic analyses done in the three laboratories. Comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports future development of reference virus materials for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.",,['NOTNLM'],"['454 Roche', 'Illumina', 'adventitious viruses', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'spiking study', 'virus detection']",PMC5597969,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the multifunctional properties of this subset, we examined its development and functional recovery in a cohort of children undergoing alpha/beta T-cell depleted HLA-haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The results obtained indicate that CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells are present in both PB and BM already at one month post-HSCT, with an increased frequency in BM of graft recipients as compared with normal subjects. During the first 6 months after HSCT, no difference in CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells distribution between PB and BM was observed. In comparison to normal subjects, CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells from transplanted patients show lower expression levels of CD25 and CD127 and higher levels of CD122, and accordingly, produce higher amounts of IFNgamma after stimulation with IL-12 plus IL-15. The recovery of NK-cell cytotoxicity after HSCT was strictly restricted to CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells, and their ability to degranulate against K562 target cells or autologous leukemic blasts was completely restored only one year after HSCT. Based on the phenotypic and functional ability of reconstituted CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells, we suggest that they play an important role in host defense against leukemia relapse and infections after HSCT, and represent an ideal candidate for approaches of adoptive immunotherapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytokine production', '*Cytotoxicity', '*Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Natural Killer cell subsets', '*Phenotype', '*haematological malignancies']",PMC5599095,,,,,,,,,,"['Oncoimmunology. 2017 Oct 16;6(10 ):e1392418.

Previous studies revealed an increased intracellular Ca(2+) in red blood cells (RBCs) from patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, or Gardos channelopathy. Therefore we analyzed RBCs' Ca(2+) content from 35 patients with different types of anemia (16 patients with hereditary spherocytosis, 11 patients with hereditary xerocytosis, 5 patients with enzymopathies, and 3 patients with hemolytic anemia of unknown cause). Intracellular Ca(2+) in RBCs was measured by fluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4 and subsequent single cell analysis. We found that in RBCs from patients with hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis the intracellular Ca(2+) levels were significantly increased compared to healthy control samples. For enzymopathies and hemolytic anemia of unknown cause the intracellular Ca(2+) levels in RBCs were not significantly different. These results lead us to the hypothesis that increased Ca(2+) levels in RBCs are a shared component in the mechanism causing an accelerated clearance of RBCs from the blood stream in channelopathies such as hereditary xerocytosis and in diseases involving defects of cytoskeletal components like hereditary spherocytosis. Future drug developments should benefit from targeting Ca(2+) entry mediating molecular players leading to better therapies for patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['calcium homeostasis', 'channelopathies', 'erythrocyte', 'live cell imaging', 'rare anemia', 'spherocytosis', 'xerocytosis']",PMC5592231,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional pulsed laser approaches require, however, relatively long irradiation times to achieve a significant inactivation of virus. In this study, we investigate the enhancement of the photonic inactivation of Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) via 805 nm femtosecond pulses through gold nanorods whose localized surface plasmon resonance overlaps with the excitation laser. We report a plasmonically enhanced virus inactivation, with greater than 3.7-log reduction measured by virus infectivity assays. Reliable virus inactivation was obtained for 10 s laser exposure with incident laser powers >/=0.3 W. Importantly, the fs-pulse induced inactivation was selective to the virus and did not induce any measurable damage to co-incubated antibodies.

Although free fatty acid-mediated apoptosis is a prominent feature of NASH, the impact of HCV infection on hepatocyte lipotoxicity has remained largely unexplored. The study aimed at identifying whether infection by HCV affected the apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes during fatty acid assault. MATERIAL AND METHODS OR6 cells, which are derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cells and harbor a full-length HCV RNA genome replication system, were treated with palmitate. Apoptosis was examined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Activation and expression of JNK, Bim, cIAP-1, and Mcl-1 were examined by immunoblotting. mRNA expression of CHOP, a major player in endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, was assessed by real-time PCR. RESULTS Palmitate-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, in which the HCV genome had been eradicated by treatment with interferon-alpha. Although basal expression of CHOP mRNA was enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, it was similarly upregulated in both cell lines following palmitate treatment. Notably, palmitate-induced JNK phosphorylation was accentuated in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. Inhibition of JNK with SP600125 attenuated palmitate-induced apoptosis. Palmitate-mediated upregulation of BH3-only protein Bim, which acts downstream of JNK, was also enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. In contrast, Mcl-1 and cIAP-1 were equally reduced in OR6 cells and cured cells following palmitate treatment. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that during lipoapoptosis, HCV infection may enhance hepatocyte toxicity by increasing JNK phosphorylation.",,,,PMC5621789,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigating arsenic sensitivity of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we proposed that PML oxidation promotes NB biogenesis. However, physiological links between PML and oxidative stress response in vivo remain unexplored. Here, we identify PML as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor. Pml(-/-) cells accumulate ROS, whereas PML expression decreases ROS levels. Unexpectedly, Pml(-/-) embryos survive acute glutathione depletion. Moreover, Pml(-/-) animals are resistant to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity or fasting-induced steatosis. Molecularly, Pml(-/-) animals fail to properly activate oxidative stress-responsive p53 targets, whereas the NRF2 response is amplified and accelerated. Finally, in an oxidative stress-prone background, Pml(-/-) animals display a longevity phenotype, likely reflecting decreased basal p53 activation. Thus, similar to p53, PML exerts basal antioxidant properties but also drives oxidative stress-induced changes in cell survival/proliferation or metabolism in vivo. Through NB biogenesis, PML therefore couples ROS sensing to p53 responses, shedding a new light on the role of PML in senescence or stem cell biology.",['(c) 2017 Niwa-Kawakita et al.'],,,PMC5679165,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 20.,"The high proportion of long-term nonprogressors among chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients suggests the existence of a regulatory network that restrains the proliferation of tumor B cells. The identification of molecular determinants composing such network is hence fundamental for our understanding of CLL pathogenesis. Based on our previous finding establishing a deficiency in the signaling adaptor p66Shc in CLL cells, we undertook to identify unique phenotypic traits caused by this defect. Here we show that a lack of p66Shc shapes the transcriptional profile of CLL cells and leads to an upregulation of the surface receptor ILT3, the immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 that is normally found on myeloid cells. The ectopic expression of ILT3 in CLL was a distinctive feature of neoplastic B cells and hematopoietic stem cells, thus identifying ILT3 as a selective marker of malignancy in CLL and the first example of phenotypic continuity between mature CLL cells and their progenitors in the bone marrow. ILT3 expression in CLL was found to be driven by Deltex1, a suppressor of antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes. Triggering of ILT3 inhibited the activation of Akt kinase upon B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. This effect was achieved through the dynamic coalescence of ILT3, BCRs, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 into inhibitory clusters at the cell surface. Collectively, our findings identify ILT3 as a signature molecule of p66Shc deficiency in CLL and indicate that ILT3 may functionally contribute to a regulatory network controlling tumor progression by suppressing the Akt pathway.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, no consensus exists regarding optimal therapy in this patient population. Areas covered: The following review is a comprehensive summary of various therapeutic options reported over the past few years in elderly patients with acute leukemia. Expert commentary: While evidences can guide identification of frail older patients, sensitive assessment strategies are required to identify fit and vulnerable patients regardless of chronologic age. Individualized treatments may take into account not only an increase in survival, but also the maintenance or improvement in terms of quality of life, the management of symptoms, and a maximization of time outside of hospital care. In this setting, comprehensive geriatric assessments have been shown to improve routine assessment. Molecular abnormalities provide the genomic footprint for the development of targeted therapies. The addition of new monoclonal antibodies to conventional treatments also demonstrated promising primary results. Ongoing clinical trials testing the activity of these new agents may reshape treatment strategies in the elderly patient population.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*elderly', '*fitness', '*geriatric assessment', '*prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I analyze three related concerns that distinguish this case from other accounts of refused treatment. First, I place deference to grandparents as decision makers in the context of surrogate decision making more generally. Second, the maternal grandfather's ardent refusal of treatment and his rationale appeared to be inconsistent with the beliefs expressed by other family members and by members of the same Amish community, leading members of the medical team to question whether refusal of treatment should be treated differently when it appears to be based on the idiosyncratic beliefs of an individual rather than on community-wide values. Third, the medical team perceived tension and dissension between the nonverbal behavior of some family members and the verbal statements made by the maternal grandfather, leading the team to question the parents' true wishes and debate how to weigh nonverbal and indirect forms of communication. Finally, building upon the conclusions of these queries, I explore whether, if the child's prognosis was less favorable or if he were to relapse later, the maternal grandfather should have been permitted to drive a decision to refuse further treatment.",['Copyright 2017 The Journal of Clinical Ethics.

GATA-2-regulated enhancers increase Gata2 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and control hematopoiesis. The +9.5-kb enhancer activates transcription in endothelium and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its deletion abrogates HSC generation. The -77-kb enhancer activates transcription in myeloid progenitors, and its deletion impairs differentiation. Since +9.5(-/-) embryos are HSC deficient, it was unclear whether the +9.5 functions in progenitors or if GATA-2 expression in progenitors solely requires -77. We further dissected the mechanisms using -77;+9.5 compound heterozygous (CH) mice. The embryonic lethal CH mutation depleted megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs). While the +9.5 suffices for HSC generation, the -77 and +9.5 must reside on one allele to induce MEPs.

Epub 2017 Sep 26.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the advent of molecular assessment, banding cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) still have a significant role in diagnostic and prognostic approaches to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Area covered: At diagnosis and during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), cytogenetics is used to detect the Philadelphia chromosome, with its typical translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), and any additional or other chromosomal aberrations (ACAs and OCAs) that may arise in 5-10% of cases, the latter associated to transformation of the disease in blast phases. In this review, the potential role of banding cytogenetics and FISH is discussed through a review of published papers on the prognostic impact of these tools in CML treatment and monitoring. Expert commentary: Cytogenetic techniques, including banding cytogenetics and FISH, continue to maintain a crucial role in CML monitoring. At diagnosis and after 3 months of therapy, banding cytogenetics will continue to be an essential test to perform, but it will become redundant after the achievement of a major molecular response (MMR) assessed with molecular techniques. FISH analysis maintains its usefulness in monitoring the response to TKIs only in special situations.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Banding cytogenetics', '*additional chromosome abnormalities (ACAs)', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)', '*fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', '*other chromosome abnormalities (OCAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, xenotransplantation of human cancer cells in embryos or adult zebrafish offers the advantage of studying the behavior of human cancer cells in a live organism. Chemical-genetic screens using zebrafish embryos have uncovered novel druggable pathways and new therapeutic strategies, some of which are now tested in clinical trials.

CONCLUSION: There is a wide differential for fever after a spinal cord injury. In this case report, the source of fever was APL. It is important as healthcare providers to not overlook fevers when otherwise common causes do not fit the clinical picture.

Epub 2017 Sep 29.,"With the growing demands of the early, accurate, and sensitive diagnosis for cancers, the development of new diagnostic technologies becomes increasingly important. In this study, we proposed a strategy for efficient capture and sensitive detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using an array nanochannel-ion channel hybrid coupled with an electrochemical detection technique. The aptamer probe was immobilized on the ion channel surface to couple with the protein overexpressed on the CTCs membrane. Through this special molecular recognition, CTCs can be selectively captured. The trapped CTCs cover the ion channel entrance efficiently, which will dramatically block the ionic flow through channels, resulting in a varied mass-transfer property of the nanochannel-ion channel hybrid. On the basis of the changed mass-transfer properties, the captured CTCs can be sensitively detected using the electrochemical linear sweep voltammetry technique. Furthermore, due to the amplified response of array channels compared to that of a single channel, the detection sensitivity can be enhanced greatly. The results showed that acute leukemia CCRF-CEM (a type of CTC) concentration as low as 100 cells mL(-1) can be successfully captured and detected. The present method provides a simple, sensitive, and label-free technique for CTCs capture, detection, and release, which would hold great potential in the early clinical diagnosis and treatment of cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 12.,"Post-marketing research in oncology has rarely been described. We aimed to characterize post-marketing trials for a consistent set of anticancer agents over a long period. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of post-marketing trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov through September 2014 for novel anticancer agents approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency between 2005 and 2010. All relevant post-marketing trials were classified according to indication, primary outcome, starting date, sponsors, and planned enrollment. Supplemental indications were retrieved from regulatory documents and publication rate was assessed by two different methods. Ten novel anticancer agents were eligible: five were indicated for hematologic malignancies and the remaining five for solid cancers (three for kidney cancer). We identified 2,345 post-marketing trials; 1,362 (58.1%) targeted an indication other than the originally approved one. We observed extreme variations among drugs in both number of post-marketing trials (range 8-530) and overall population to be enrolled per trial (1-8,381). Post-marketing trials assessed almost all types of cancers, the three most frequently studied cancers being leukemia, kidney cancer and myeloma. In all, 6.6% of post-marketing trials had a clinical endpoint as a primary outcome, and 35.9% and 54.1% had a safety or surrogate endpoint, respectively, as a primary outcome. Nine drugs obtained approval for supplemental indications. The publication rate at 10 years was 12.3 to 26.1% depending on the analysis method. In conclusion, we found that post-marketing research in oncology is highly heterogeneous and the publication rate of launched trials is low.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*anticancer agents', '*outcome', '*post-marketing trials', '*publication rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"The objective of this prospective clinical trial (JALSG-STIM213, UMIN000011971) was to evaluate treatment-free remission (TFR) rates after discontinuation of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML patients who received imatinib treatment for at least 3 years and sustained deep molecular response for at least 2 years were eligible. Molecular recurrence was defined as loss of major molecular response (MMR). Of the 68 eligible patients, 38.2% were women, the median age was 55.0 years, and the median duration of imatinib treatment was 97.5 months. The 12-month TFR rate was 67.6%. Patients who lost MMR were immediately treated with imatinib again; all re-achieved MMR. Three-year treatment-free survival (TFS) was estimated as 64.6% using the Kaplan-Meier method. Undetectable molecular residual disease (UMRD) was defined as no BCR-ABL1 in > 100,000 ABL1 control genes using international scale polymerase chain reaction. UMRD at the study baseline was found to be predictive of continuation of TFR. Our findings suggest that CML patients who meet all the eligibility criteria that have commonly been used in the TFR trials are able to discontinue imatinib use safely. TFR may thus be valuable as a new goal for CML treatment in Japan.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Deep molecular response', 'Imatinib', 'Treatment-free remission', 'Undetectable molecular residual disease']",,"['15ck0106189h0001/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '16ck0106189h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '17ck0106189h0003/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development']",,,,,,,['Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group'],,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"2016 marked the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident. We and others wrote reviews for the 25th anniversary. Since then, additional papers have appeared and it seems timely to highlight lessons learned. To present, not a systematic review, but a commentary drawing attention to notable findings. We include not only recent reports and updates on previous results, but key findings from prior Chernobyl studies. The dose-dependent increase in Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) following childhood I-131 exposure in Ukraine and Belarus has now been shown to persist for decades. Studies of post-Chernobyl PTCs have produced novel information on chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions, critical to understanding molecular mechanisms. Studies of clean-up workers/liquidators suggest dose-related increases of thyroid cancer and hematological malignancies in adults. They also report increases in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. If confirmed, these would have significant public health and radiation protection implications. The lens opacities following low to moderate doses found earlier are also a concern, particularly among interventional radiologists who may receive substantial lens doses. Finally, there is some, inconsistent, evidence for genetic effects among offspring of exposed persons. Further efforts, including improved dosimetry, collection of information on other risk factors, and continued follow-up/monitoring of established cohorts, could contribute importantly to further understand effects of low doses and dose-rates of radiation, particularly in young people, and ensure that appropriate public health and radiation protection systems are in place. This will require multinational collaborations and long-term funding.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiovascular diseases', '*Cataracts', '*Chernobyl', '*Leukemia', '*Multinational collaborations', '*Radiation', '*Thyroid cancer', '*Thyroid disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is limited literature on this topic and hence, we wish to briefly describe management of two cases at our institution and their outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively identified two patients with immune-mediated AD after SCT from our database. Immune-mediated AD was defined as AD secondary to an immune-mediated etiology without an alternative cause and responding to immunosuppression. RESULTS: The first case is of a 32-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent double umbilical cord allogeneic SCT. The second patient was a 51-year-old woman with secondary AML who underwent matched-related donor allogeneic SCT. Both underwent an extensive work-up for an underlying etiology prior to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). CONCLUSIONS: AD after SCT is a rare yet significant clinical entity. A work-up of underlying etiology should be performed. IVIG is a treatment option for these patients.",,,,PMC5591963,,,,,,,,,,,,

International Prognostic Scoring System is the gold standard for MDS classification; however, patients exhibiting different clinical behaviors often coexist in the same group, indicating that the currently available scoring systems are insufficient. The genes that have recently been identified as mutated in MDS, including additional sex combs like 1, transcriptional regulator (ASXL1), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and KRAS proto-oncogene and GTPase (KRAS)/NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS), may contribute to a more comprehensive classification, as well as to the prognosis and progression of the disease. In the present study, the mutations in the ASXL1, TP53 and NRAS/KRAS genes in 50 patients were evaluated by sequencing genomic bone marrow DNA. Nine patients (18%) presented with at least one type of mutation. Mutations in TP53 were the most frequent in six patients (12%), followed by ASXL1 in two patients (4%) and NRAS in one patient (2%).

However, these inhibitors are often invalidated due to the drug resistance. Therefore, the discovery and development of novel Bcr-Abl inhibitors is required to overwhelm the drug resistance in the treatment of CML resistant to the currently used first-line Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Herein we have described a newly developed Bcr-Abl inhibitor CT-721, which displayed potent inhibitory effects on wild-type and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. It functioned as a typically ATP-competitive inhibitor, superior to other existing Bcr-Abl inhibitors. CT-721 also demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of Bcr-Abl activation and the resultant downstream signaling transduction pathways in Bcr-Abl positive cells. Furthermore, CT-721 induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and efficaciously inhibited tumor growth in Bcr-Abl-expressed K562 and KU812 xenograft models in a mechanism-based manner. Further PK/PD studies revealed a positive in vivo correlation between the compound concentration and inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity. Taken together, CT-721 is a potent and time-dependent Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, and has shown strong in vitro and in vivo anti-CML activities with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, differentiating it from other Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors already approved and current in development for the treatment of CML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CT-721', 'anti-tumor', 'leukemia.']",PMC5604209,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on lung cancer and explored its possible mechanism. It was observed that As2O3 significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer xenografts and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. The inhibitory effect of As2O3 on cell proliferation in vitro was more remarkable in vascular endothelial cells than in lung cancer cells. It was also observed that As2O3 inhibited the migration of vascular endothelial cells and disrupted vascular tube formation on Matrigel assays. In addition, a series of key signaling factors involved in multiple stages of angiogenesis, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB/PDGF receptor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/VEGF receptor-2, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/FGF receptor-1 and delta like canonical Notch ligand 4/Notch-1, were regulated by As2O3.

The probes of the human exon arrays were re-annotated and the probes uniquely mapping to lncRNAs were retained at the gene level. Following the analysis of GSE53757 and GSE46699, which contained paired ccRCC cancer and normal adjacent tissue samples, 32 differentially expressed lncRNAs (adjusted P<0.01) in ccRCC were identified. Various lncRNAs, including ENSG00000177133, NR_024418, T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (TCL6), growth arrest-specific transcript 5, deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2, colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) and MIR155HG, have been reported to be abnormally expressed in cancers. Of these genes, NR_24418 and TCL6 have been reported to be associated with ccRCC. Following analysis of GSE47352, which contained 4 primary metastatic and 5 non-metastatic tumor samples, the 50 top differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in metastatic ccRCC (Mann-Whitney U test, P<0.05). Comparison with the ccRCC associated lncRNAs revealed that the lncRNA CRNDE demonstrated an increased expression in ccRCC and metastatic ccRCC samples, which suggested that CRNDE is important in the progression of ccRCC. The lncRNA ENSG00000244020 was decreased in ccRCC and metastatic ccRCC, suggesting that silencing of ENSG00000244020 may be important in ccRCC development. Overall, a set of lncRNAs was identified as differentially expressed in ccRCC and metastatic ccRCC, providing potential candidates for the discovery of novel cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve diagnosis and therapy in RCC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'data mining', 'long non-coding RNA', 'microarray analysis']",PMC5588171,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that, in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), ILC2s are increased and hyper-activated through the interaction of CRTH2 and NKp30 with elevated tumour-derived PGD2 and B7H6, respectively. ILC2s, in turn, activate monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) via IL-13 secretion. Upon treating APL with all-trans retinoic acid and achieving complete remission, the levels of PGD2, NKp30, ILC2s, IL-13 and M-MDSCs are restored. Similarly, disruption of this tumour immunosuppressive axis by specifically blocking PGD2, IL-13 and NKp30 partially restores ILC2 and M-MDSC levels and results in increased survival. Thus, using APL as a model, we uncover a tolerogenic pathway that may represent a relevant immunosuppressive, therapeutic targetable, mechanism operating in various human tumour types, as supported by our observations in prostate cancer.Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) modulate inflammatory and allergic responses, but their function in cancer immunity is still unclear.

The endonuclease DNase1L2 and the exonuclease Trex2 are expressed specifically in cornifying keratinocytes. Deletion of DNase1L2 causes retention of nuclear DNA in the tongue epithelium but not in the skin. Here we report that lack of Trex2 results in the accumulation of DNA fragments in the cytoplasm of cornifying lingual keratinocytes and co-deletion of DNase1L2 and Trex2 causes massive accumulation of DNA fragments throughout the cornified layers of the tongue epithelium. By contrast, cornification-associated DNA breakdown was not compromised in the epidermis. Aberrant retention of DNA in the tongue epithelium was associated neither with enhanced expression of DNA-driven response genes, such as Ifnb, Irf7 and Cxcl10, nor with inflammation. Of note, the expression of Tlr9, Aim2 and Tmem173, key DNA sensor genes, was markedly lower in keratinocytes and keratinocyte-built tissues than in macrophages and immune tissues, and DNA-driven response genes were not induced by introduction of DNA in keratinocytes.

Here, the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line was used to isolate A. ovis from PCR-positive sheep and goats in Heilongjiang Province, China. Two weeks after inoculation, morulae were observed in cytoplasmic vacuoles in four different HL-60 cultures. Confocal microscopy using a Cy3-labeled A. ovis-specific probe confirmed that the HL-60 cells were infected with A. ovis. Cells from the 6th HL-60 subculture displayed positive fluorescence when incubated with A. ovis antiserum in the indirect fluorescent antibody assay. PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA, groEL, gltA, msp2 and msp4 Anaplasma genes revealed that the four A. ovis culture isolates were identical. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences clustered with other A. ovis strains but could clearly be distinguished from other Anaplasma species. When the 18th subculture of infected HL-60 cells was examined by electron microscopy, lysosomes were often observed near the vacuoles. After the 24th subculture, Giemsa staining and PCR indicated that the HL-60 cells were negative for A. ovis. Although A. ovis can infect HL-60 cells for only four months, the ability of the organism to infect and multiply in HL-60 cells provides a tool to study intra-erythrocytic Anaplasma and host cell interactions.",,,,PMC5625320,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like all eukaryotes, T. brucei has a cell cycle involving the de novo synthesis of DNA regulated by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides into their deoxy form. As an essential enzyme for the cell cycle, RNR is a common target for cancer chemotherapy. We hypothesized that inhibition of RNR by genetic or pharmacological means would impair parasite growth in vitro and prolong the survival of infected animals. Our results demonstrate that RNR inhibition is highly effective in suppressing parasite growth both in vitro and in vivo These results support drug discovery efforts targeting the cell cycle, not only for African trypanosomiasis but possibly also for other infections by eukaryotic pathogens.IMPORTANCE The development of drugs to treat infections with eukaryotic pathogens is challenging because many key virulence factors have closely related homologues in humans. Drug toxicity greatly limits these development efforts. For pathogens that replicate at a high rate, especially in the blood, an alternative approach is to target the cell cycle directly, much as is done to treat some hematologic malignancies. The results presented here indicate that targeting the cell cycle via inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase is effective at killing trypanosomes and prolonging the survival of infected animals.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Epting et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*African sleeping sickness', '*Trypanosoma brucei', '*hydroxyurea', '*ribonucleotide reductase']",PMC5605941,"['F30 HL094026/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL080692/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025741/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001422/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"Purpose: The approval of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has generated an unmet need for baseline molecular parameters associated with inadequate imatinib responses.Experimental Design: We correlated BCR-ABL/GUS(IS) and BCR-ABL/ABL transcripts at diagnosis with the outcome-defined by the 2013 European LeukemiaNet recommendations-of 272 patients newly diagnosed with CML receiving imatinib 400 mg/daily. Applying receiver-operating characteristic curves, we defined BCR-ABL/GUS(IS) and BCR-ABL/ABL levels associated with lower probabilities of optimal response, failure-free (FFS), event-free (EFS), transformation-free (TFS), and overall survival (OS).Results: With a median follow-up of 60 months, 65.4% of patients achieved an optimal response (OR), 5.6% were classified as ""warnings,"" 22.4% failed imatinib, and 6.6% switched to a different TKI because of drug intolerance. We recorded 19 deaths (6.9%), seven (2.5%) attributable to disease progression. We found that higher BCR-ABL/GUS(IS) levels at diagnosis were associated with inferior rates of OR (P < 0.001), FFS (P < 0.001), and EFS (P < 0.001). Elevated BCR-ABL/GUS(IS) levels were also associated with lower rates of TFS (P = 0.029) but not with OS (P = 0.132). Similarly, high BCR-ABL/ABL levels at diagnosis were associated with inferior rates of OR (P = 0.03), FFS (P = 0.001), and EFS (P = 0.005), but not with TFS (P = 0.167) or OS (P = 0.052). However, in internal validation experiments, GUS outperformed ABL in samples collected at diagnosis as the latter produced 80% misclassification rates.Conclusions: Our data suggest that high BCR-ABL transcripts at diagnosis measured using GUS as a reference gene identify patients with CML unlikely to benefit from standard-dose imatinib.

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a nearly always incurable malignancy of plasma cells, so new approaches to treatment are needed. T-cell therapies are a promising approach for treating MM, with a mechanism of action different than those of standard MM treatments. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins incorporating antigen-recognition domains and T-cell signaling domains. T cells genetically engineered to express CARs can specifically recognize antigens. Success of CAR-T cells (CAR-Ts) against leukemia and lymphoma has encouraged development of CAR-T therapies for MM. Target antigens for CARs must be expressed on malignant cells, but expression on normal cells must be absent or limited. B-cell maturation antigen is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells. CAR-Ts targeting B-cell maturation antigen have demonstrated significant antimyeloma activity in early clinical trials. Toxicities in these trials, including cytokine release syndrome, have been similar to toxicities observed in CAR-T trials for leukemia. Targeting postulated CD19(+) myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-Ts is a novel approach to MM therapy. MM antigens including CD138, CD38, signaling lymphocyte-activating molecule 7, and kappa light chain are under investigation as CAR targets. MM is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, so targeting of >1 antigen might often be required for effective treatment of MM with CAR-Ts. Integration of CAR-Ts with other myeloma therapies is an important area of future research. CAR-T therapies for MM are at an early stage of development but have great promise to improve MM treatment.",,,,PMC5731088,,,,,,,,,,,,

BK virus (BKV), John Cunningham virus (JCV), and Merkel cell carcinoma virus (MCV) are the members of the rapidly growing human polyomavirus (hPyV) family that commonly infects most healthy humans. These viruses have a clearly established potential for causing severe end-organ damage or malignant transformation, especially in individuals with weakened immunity who are unable to mount or regain endogenous T-cell responses as a result of underlying leukemia or iatrogenic immunosuppression in autoimmunity, bone marrow and solid organ transplant settings. Here we will discuss recent advances in using T-cell-based immunotherapies to save patients suffering from PyV-associated diseases including hemorrhagic cystitis, BKV virus-associated nephropathy, and JC-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

Epub 2017 Aug 18.,"OBJECTIVE: The treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been revolutionized with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the combination of these agents with chemotherapy. Blinatumomab is a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody with clinical activity as single-agent in the relapsed setting and independent of BCR-ABL1 mutational status, including T315I. The combination of blinatumomab with a TKI may further improve outcomes for this high-risk population, including higher eradication of minimal residual disease and minimize the use of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 12 adults with relapsed/refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 9) and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (n = 3), treated with the combination blinatumomab and a TKI (ponatinib, n = 8; dasatinib, n = 3; bosutinib, n = 1). All patients have previously failed at least 1 line of chemotherapy, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and 1 class of TKIs. Patients were treated for either overt hematologic relapse (n = 6) or persistent minimal residual disease following other regimens (n = 6). RESULTS: The complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response rates were 50% (3/6), 71% (5/7), and 75% (9/12), respectively. Two cases of grade 2 cytokine release syndrome were observed, all of which resolved with steroids and tocilizumab. No cardiovascular adverse events were encountered. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the median survival was not reached; the 6-month and 1-year overall survival rates were 73%. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of blinatumomab with TKI is safe and effective in patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ disease. Prospective studies are warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on proliferation and apoptosis of human megakaryoblastic cells (Dami and MEG-01) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. CCK8 assay was employed to measure cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was adopted to detect cell apoptosis. Western blot was further employed to measure apoptosis-related proteins. In Dami and MEG-01 cells, metformin significantly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and metformin (4 mM) was selected for subsequent experiments. Metformin inhibited ERK1/2, JNK, and PI3K/Akt, but activated p38 pathway in these two cells. Moreover, inhibition of ERK1/2, JNK or PI3K/Akt pathway alone induced cell apoptosis compared to the control group. The combination of specific inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK or PI3K/Akt pathway and metformin further promoted cell apoptosis and the up-regulation of p21, Bax, Bad, cleaved caspase-3 and -9 as well as the down-regulation of Bcl-2 mediated by metformin alone, but inhibition of p38 pathway exhibited the opposite results.

Epub 2017 Sep 15.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute leukemia (AL) have a higher rate of congestive heart failure than patients with other cancers. AL may predispose to cardiac dysfunction before chemotherapy because of high cytokine release or direct leukemic myocardial infiltration. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether AL is associated with abnormalities of myocardial structure and function before chemotherapy and to identify possible risk factors associated with these myocardial changes. METHODS: Using an echocardiographic database, 76 patients with AL and 76 patients without cancer matched for age, gender, hypertension, and the presence of diabetes were retrospectively selected. Subsequently, to assess the effect of a nonhematologic malignancy, 28 women in each group were matched with women with breast cancer. Left ventricular (LV) mass, volumes, ejection fraction, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured before chemotherapy. RESULTS: The patients were predominantly male (63%), with a median age of 51 years, and had low prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Despite similar LV ejection fractions, patients with AL had higher LV mass and volumes and lower GLS (-19.3 +/- 2.7% vs -20.9 +/- 1.9%, P < .001) than patients without cancer. Similarly, GLS was lower in women with AL compared with women with breast cancer or without cancer. Among patients with AL, high body mass index, low LV ejection fraction, and a small number of circulating lymphocytes were all independently associated with low GLS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AL had higher LV volumes and lower GLS than patients without cancer and lower GLS than patients with breast cancer, suggesting that AL by itself may be associated with these cardiac alterations.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society of Echocardiography.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"INTRODUCTION: Hematological malignancies originate and progress in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, where they establish a uniquely immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Although high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches are being employed to interrogate immune surveillance and escape mechanisms in patients with solid tumours, and to identify actionable targets for immunotherapy, our knowledge of the immunological landscape of hematological malignancies, as well as our understanding of the molecular circuits that underpin the establishment of immune tolerance, is not comprehensive. Areas covered: This article will discuss how multiplexed immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry/mass cytometry, proteomic and genomic techniques can be used to dynamically capture the complexity of tumour-immune interactions. Moreover, the analysis of multi-dimensional, clinically annotated data sets obtained from public repositories such as Array Express, TCGA and GEO is crucial to identify immune biomarkers, to inform the rational design of immune therapies and to predict clinical benefit in individual patients. We will also highlight how artificial neural network models and alternative methodologies integrating other algorithms can support the identification of key molecular drivers of immune dysfunction. Expert commentary: High-dimensional technologies have the potential to enhance our understanding of immune-cancer interactions and will support clinical decision making and the prediction of therapeutic benefit from immune-based interventions.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological malignancies', '*biomarker', '*gene expression profiling', '*immunotherapy', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma', '*prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) meal induces an increase in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Previous studies have shown that orange juice is able to prevent this response by inhibiting toll like receptors (TLR) expression and endotoxemia. Our goal was to study the proteome response in PBMC after the consumption of a HFHC meal consumed with water, orange juice or an isocaloric beverage (water with glucose). Twelve healthy individuals completed the protocol in a crossover design, and blood samples were obtained before and 1, 3, and 5 h after consumption. Proteomic profile, glucose, insulin, lipid and cytokines levels were investigated. The glycemic and insulinemic response was higher when the meal was consumed with glucose, while there was no difference in the response between water and orange juice. Proteome analysis in PBMC was carried out using TMT ten-plex. A total of 3813 proteins, originating from 15662 peptides were identified. Three proteins showed significantly altered expression in the three treatments: apolipoprotein A-II, ceruloplasmin and hemopexin. When the HFHC meal was consumed with water there was an increase in some inflammatory pathways such as the Fc-gamma receptor dependent phagocytosis and the complement cascade, but the immune system as a whole was not significantly altered. However, when the meal was consumed with glucose, the immune system was up regulated. Among the pathways induced after 3 h were those of the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling. Five hours after the meal, pathways of the complement cascade and classical antibody mediated complement activation were up regulated. When the meal was consumed with orange juice there was an up regulation of proteins involved in signal transduction, DNA replication and cell cycle. The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) showed a 28.2-fold increase. This protein was down regulated when the meal was consumed with water. Regarding the immune system, several of the pathways induced by glucose were down regulated when the meal was consumed with orange juice: proteins involved with the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling. Therefore, we have shown that orange juice can not only suppress diet induced inflammation, but also regulate the expression of proteins such as PML, which may play a key role in the regulation of metabolism.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*inflammation', '*oxidative stress', '*peripheral blood mononuclear cells', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein']",,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02587507'],,,,,,,,,

Methods: Diagnostic samples from 219 patients with AML NOS were analyzed for RUNX1 mutations using standard polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Results: Thirty-one RUNX1 mutations were detected in 33 (15.1%) patients. Mutations clustered in the Runt homology (61.3%) and transactivation domains (25.8%). Frameshift mutations were most common (51.6%), followed by missense (41.9%) and nonsense (6.5%) mutations. Patients with RUNX1 mutations had a lower platelet count (P = .013) and shorter relapse-free survival (P = .045) than those without. The presence of RUNX1 and NPM1 or CEBPA mutations was mutually exclusive. A literature review, including our study, showed that patients with RUNX1 mutations were associated with intermediate risk; coexisting mutations such as FLT3-ITD, ASXL1, TET2, and DNMT3A; and a relatively cytogenetic heterogeneity. Conclusions: Our findings strengthen previous data concerning RUNX1 mutations in AML and support the notion that RUNX1 mutational status should be integrated into a diagnostic workup of AML, particularly for AML NOS or an intermediate-risk group.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified (six MDS-U BL, 13 MDS-U Pan, and eight MDS-U CG). Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were found in six of six, seven of 13, and eight of eight cases in MDS-U BL, Pan, and CG, respectively (P > .05). Overall, four of six patients with MDS-U BL progressed to acute myeloid leukemia; no MDS-U Pan or CG patients did. The rates of progression-free survival and mortality (overall survival) were significantly higher in MDS-U BL compared with Pan and CG (P < .001 for both). Conclusions: We find that MDS-U BL is a distinct subset of MDS-U with a poor prognosis, while MDS-U Pan and CG are relatively indolent. Evaluation of peripheral blood smears in patients with MDS is essential for accurate classification and prognosis.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017. All rights reserved.

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) by serine protease high-temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2), a member of the Htr family, in K562 cells. In addition, the study aimed to observe the effect of this regulation on cell biological functions and its associated mechanisms. Expression of WT1 and HtrA2 mRNA, and proteins following imatinib and the HtrA2 inhibitor 5-[5-(2-nitrophenyl) furfuryl iodine]-1, 3-diphenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid (UCF-101) treatment was detected with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Subsequent to treatment with drugs and UCF-101, the proliferative function of K562 cells was detected using MTT assays, and the rate of apoptosis was detected using Annexin V with propidium iodide flow cytometry in K562 cells. The protein levels in the signaling pathway were analyzed using western blotting following treatment with imatinib and UCF-101. In K562 cells, imatinib treatment activated HtrA2 gene at a transcription level, while the WT1 gene was simultaneously downregulated. Following HtrA2 inhibitor (UCF-101) treatment, the downregulation of WT1 increased gradually. At the protein level, imatinib induced the increase in HtrA2 protein level and concomitantly downregulated WT1 protein level. Subsequent to HtrA2 inhibition by UCF-101, the WT1 protein level decreased temporarily, but eventually increased. Imatinib induced apoptosis in K562 cells, but this effect was attenuated by the HtrA2 inhibitor UCF-101, resulting in the upregulation of the WT1 protein level. However; UCF-101 did not markedly change the proliferation inhibition caused by imatinib. Imatinib activated the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway in K562 cells, and UCF-101 affected the activation of imatinib in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Imatinib inhibited the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) pathway markedly and persistently, but UCF-101 exhibited no notable effect on the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway. HtrA2 and its regulatory effect on WT1 may affect the sensitivity of BCR/ABL(+) cell lines to target therapy drugs through different mechanisms. Regulation of WT1 by HtrA2 occurs in K562 cells, and the regulation may affect the apoptosis of K562 cells under the stress caused by chemotherapeutic treatment. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which serves an important role in cell apoptosis, is a downstream pathway of this regulation.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Wilms Tumor 1', 'chronic myelocytic leukemia', 'imatinib', 'mitochondrial', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway', 'serine protease high-temperature requirement protein A2']",PMC5587996,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study assessed the utility and prognostic value of selected microRNA (miRNA/miR) in BCP-ALL. The changes in the expression levels of these miRNAs regarding known gene lesions affecting lymphoid development [early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), ETS variant 6 (ETV6), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), paired box 5 (PAX5), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN) 2A/CDKN2B, retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), B-cell translocation gene 1 protein (BTG1)] were analyzed. The following miRNAs were analyzed: miR-24, miR-31, miR-128, miR-542, and miR-708. The present study focused on patients with deletions of the IKAROS transcriptional factor gene IKZF1, which is currently considered to be an independent negative prognostic factor for ALL outcome. It was demonstrated that the expression level of miR-128 was significantly lower in patients with IKZF1 deletion compared with patients without IKZF1 deletion. Additionally, low expression of miR-542 was associated with CDKN2A/B and miR-31deletions, and low expression of miR-24 was associated with miR-31 deletion. Low expression of miR-31, miR-24, miR-708 and miR-128 was associated with PAX5 deletion, high expression of miR-24 and miR-542 was associated with PAR1 deletion and high expression of miR-708 was associated with ETV6 deletion. The expression of the selected miRNAs was not associated with deletions of BTG1, EBF1 and RB1. These data, by emphasizing the association of miRNAs expression level with microdeletions, may assist to elucidate ALL biology and contribute to future studies on the possible applications of the miRNA profile for diagnosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['IKZF1', 'microRNA', 'microdeletions', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'transcriptional factors']",PMC5588016,,,,,,,,,,,,

This malignancy may occur in the presence or absence of hematological disorders. Primary MS involving the central nervous system (CNS-MS) is rare, and has only been described in a small number of isolated case reports. The diagnosis of CNS-MS is challenging and strategies for its management are undefined. The present study describes 4 cases of CNS-MS. The hematological indices at admission were normal and all patients presented with location-associated nonspecific symptoms. In magnetic resonance imaging scans, the tumors appeared isointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, with marked enhancement following contrast agent administration. Only 1 patient progressed to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), with this occurring 3 weeks following histological diagnosis. During the follow-up period, the patient with AML succumbed to the disease, local recurrence was noted in another patient for which a second surgery was requested and no progression was observed in the remaining 2 patients. CNS-MS has unique radiological characteristics and, due to its diffuse tissue infiltration, gross total resection is challenging. It is important for clinicians to be aware of potential hematological disorders in patients with CNS-MS. A combined surgical and chemotherapeutic strategy may be able to provide long-term control of this malignancy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['brain tumor', 'central nervous system', 'leukemia', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'spinal tumor']",PMC5587933,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although recurrent chromosomal and genetic abnormalities are frequently observed in aCML, none are specific to this type of leukemia. The present study reported a case of aCML associated with i(X)(p10), a rare recurrent chromosomal abnormality of hematological malignancy. A 40-year-old female was referred to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) due to slight leukocytosis and anemia. A bone marrow aspiration revealed 4% blasts and granulocytic hyperplasia with dysplasia. A G-banded cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed 46, X, isochromosome X(iX)(p10) in all metaphases. The percentage of the neutrophil precursors promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the peripheral blood was >10% throughout the clinical course of the patient, which resulted in a diagnosis of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment with hydroxycarbamide was not able to effectively alleviate leukocytosis, and the disease progressed with the appearance of an additional cytogenetic abnormality, t(10;17)(p13;q21). Subsequently, the patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor, and subsequent cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype with full donor chimerism. The isodicentric X(idicX)(q13) mutation is a similar abnormality to i(X)(p10) and may result in a loss of the X-inactive specific transcript gene located at Xq13.2, the deletion of which has been previously reported to result in the development of MDS/MPN in mice. In addition, i(X)(p10) was identified as the sole chromosomal abnormality at the diagnosis of aCML in the case of the present study, which is similar to patients from previous studies of other hematological malignancies and supports the hypothesis that i(X)(p10) may have served a primary role in the leukemogenesis of aCML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['X-inactive specific transcript', 'atypical chronic myeloid leukemia', 'i(X)(p10),t(10;17)(p13;q21)', 'idic(X)(q13)']",PMC5588062,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to identify the target gene associated with VTE for patients with lymphoma. Microarray data was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database (GSE17078), which comprised the control group, 27 normal blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) samples, and the case group, 3 BOEC samples of venous thrombosis with protein C deficiency. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the Limma package of R. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed via the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery. Differentially coexpressed pairs were identified by the DCGL package of R. The subsequent protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene coexpression networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and were visualized by Cytoscape software. A total of 110 DEGs were obtained, including 73 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses identified 132 significant GO terms and 9 significant KEGG pathways. In total, 97 PPI pairs for PPI network and 309 differential coexpression pairs for the gene coexpression network were obtained. Additionally, the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene was closely connected with other genes in the two networks. A total of 2 KEGG pathways were associated with VTE and CTGF may be the target gene of VTE in patients with lymphoma.

The 5-year relative survival rate for patients with pancreatic cancer is ~5% and the median survival time is only 6 months. The poor prognosis is mainly due to early and aggressive local invasion and metastasis, as well as dissemination of the pancreatic cancer cells. The present study demonstrated that microRNA-452 (miR-452) was markedly downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues, particularly in metastatic tumors and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-452 significantly inhibited migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory functions of miR-452 in pancreatic cancer was also investigated. The results indicated that B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) was a direct target gene of miR-452 in pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of miR-452 inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer, at least partially by knockdown of BMI1 expression.

Epub 2017 Jul 8.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergistic effect of phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI) and LY294002 [an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)] on the PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, modulating histone acetylation, inhibiting cell viability and inducing apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The inhibition of HL-60 cell viability was monitored using an MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. Expression of acetylated histone H3 and histone H4, and the Akt signaling pathway proteins phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-p70S6K) was detected using western blotting. The results of the present study identified that PHI and LY294002 were able to inhibit cell viability and induce cell apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The combination exhibited a synergistic effect on cell viability and apoptosis. PHI treatment led to an accumulation of acetylated histone H3 and histone H4, but LY294002 treatment had no effect on histone acetylation. However, LY294002 was identified to enhance the effect of PHI on histone acetylation in HL-60 cells. PHI and/or LY294002 were identified to dephosphorylate proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with a synergistic effect observed when used in combination. The results of the present study indicated that the combination of PHI and LY294002 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['LY294002', 'acetylation', 'apoptosis', 'phenylhexyl isothiocyanate', 'phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B']",PMC5588084,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Normal adult mammary stem cells (AMSCs) are promising sources for breast reconstruction, particularly following the resection of breast tumors. However, carcinogenic events can potentially convert normal AMSCs to cancer stem cells, posing a safety concern for the use of AMSCs for clinical tissue regeneration. In the present study, AMSCs and autologous primary breast cancer cells were isolated and compared for their ability to differentiate, their gene expression profile, and their potential to form tumors in vivo. AMSCs were isolated from normal tissue surrounding primary breast tumors by immunomagnetic sorting. The pluripotency of these cells was investigated by differentiation analysis, and gene expression profiles were compared with microarrays. Differentially expressed candidate genes were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The in vivo tumorigenicity of these cells, compared with low-malignancy MCF-7 cells, was also investigated by xenograft tumor formation analysis. The results revealed that AMSCs isolated from normal tissues surrounding primary breast tumors were positive for the stem cell markers epithelial-specific antigen and keratin-19. When stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor, a differentiation agent, these AMSCs formed lobuloalveolar structures with myoepithelia that were positive for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen. The gene expression profiles revealed that, compared with cancer cells, AMSCs expressed low levels of oncogenes, including MYC, RAS and ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase 2, and high levels of tumor suppressor genes, including RB transcriptional corepressor 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A. When injected into nude non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency-type mice, the AMSCs did not form tumors, and regular mammary ductal structures were generated. The AMSCs isolated from normal tissue adjacent to primary breast tumors had the normal phenotype of mammary stem cells, and therefore may be promising candidates for mammary reconstruction subsequent to breast tumor resection.",,['NOTNLM'],"['adult mammary stem cells', 'breast reconstruction', 'cancer stem cells', 'epithelial-specific antigen', 'mastectomy', 'sialomucin']",PMC5588124,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological cancers have varying phenotypes. Incidence rates (IR) of VTE in different hematological cancer types have not been investigated in a cancer-exposed subset of the general population. METHODS: In a population-based cohort, we estimated incidence rates of VTE among patients with six subtypes of hematological cancer and among age and sex matched reference subjects. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.8years, 30 objectively confirmed first-time symptomatic VTEs occurred among 838 subjects with hematological cancer. The IR of VTE was higher in all types of cancer except for indolent lymphoma but including chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with reference subjects both during the first year after cancer diagnosis and 1-5years after diagnosis. IR of VTE for indolent lymphoma was not higher than controls. CONCLUSION: The IRs of VTE were increased in all types of hematological cancer (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia) compared with reference subjects except indolent lymphomas.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemistry of these modifications is subject to clinically actionable targeting, including state-of-the-art strategies to inhibit basic oncogenic mechanisms related to histone acetylation. Although discussed in the context of acute leukemia, the concepts of acetylation writers and readers are not cell-type-specific and are generalizable to other cancers. We review the challenges and resistance mechanisms encountered to date in the development of such therapeutics and postulate how such challenges may be overcome. Because these fundamental cellular mechanisms are dysregulated in cancer biology, continued research and in-depth understanding of histone acetylation reading and writing are desired to further define optimal therapeutic strategies to affect gene activity to target cancer effectively.",,,,,"['R01 CA171338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The TRA was modeled after the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act of 1989, which has been very successful and reported significant reduction in toxic use and carcinogen release. METHODS: Data from the TRA were retrieved, and the trends in the use and release of 17 known and suspected carcinogens associated with the seven most prevalent cancers diagnosed in Ontario and reported by industrial facilities in Ontario from 2011 to 2015 were examined using methodology adapted from (Jacobs MM, Massey RI, Tenney H, Harriman E. Reducing the use of carcinogens: the Massachusetts experience. Rev Environ Health 2014;29(4):319-40). RESULTS: Carcinogens associated with lung cancers, leukemia and lymphomas were observed as the most used and released carcinogens in Ontario by amount. Overall, for 2011-2015, there was an observed reduction in the industrial use of carcinogens, except among breast carcinogens, which increased by 20%. An increase in the industrial releases of carcinogens was observed across all cancer sites, except among lung carcinogens, which decreased by 28%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the potential for reducing the cancer burden by reducing the use and release of select carcinogens associated with particularly prevalent cancers. Toxics use reduction programs can support cancer prevention initiatives by promoting targeted reductions in exposures to industrial carcinogens.",,['NOTNLM'],"['exposures', 'industrial carcinogens', 'monitoring', 'pollution prevention', 'toxics use reduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In latter cases, their clinicopathological features and the characteristics of TP53 mutations remain poorly characterized. METHODS: 176 MDS cases with TP53 mutations were stratified and characterized based on their karyotype and histologic subtype. RESULTS: Among 176 cases, 17% had a non-complex karyotype and 24% were low-grade MDS. TP53 mutations often occurred in DNA-binding domains and the majority of cases had only one mutation, irrespective of their karyotype and MDS subtype. The variant allele frequency (VAF), however, was associated with karyotype complexity and the types of MDS with a lower VAF found in cases with a non-complex karyotype and low-grade MDS. A low (<20%) VAF was associated with a better survival, as well as low-grade subtype. CONCLUSIONS: In low-grade MDS and MDS with a non-complex karyotype, TP53 mutations showed a lower VAF. Patients with a lower VAF had a better survival. TP53 mutations are not the only prognostic factor in MDS patients with TP53 mutations as the VAF, blast counts and history of prior therapy also play important roles in prognosis.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"Immunotherapy using T cells genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is rapidly emerging as a promising new treatment for haematological and non-haematological malignancies. CAR-T-cell therapy can induce rapid and durable clinical responses, but is associated with unique acute toxicities, which can be severe or even fatal. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), the most commonly observed toxicity, can range in severity from low-grade constitutional symptoms to a high-grade syndrome associated with life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction; rarely, severe CRS can evolve into fulminant haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Neurotoxicity, termed CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES), is the second most-common adverse event, and can occur concurrently with or after CRS. Intensive monitoring and prompt management of toxicities is essential to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with this potentially curative therapeutic approach; however, algorithms for accurate and consistent grading and management of the toxicities are lacking. To address this unmet need, we formed a CAR-T-cell-therapy-associated TOXicity (CARTOX) Working Group, comprising investigators from multiple institutions and medical disciplines who have experience in treating patients with various CAR-T-cell therapy products. Herein, we describe the multidisciplinary approach adopted at our institutions, and provide recommendations for monitoring, grading, and managing the acute toxicities that can occur in patients treated with CAR-T-cell therapy.",,,,PMC6733403,"['K23 CA201594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1046248'],,"['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2018 Apr;15(4):218.

It has been widely established that persistent residual leukemic burden, often referred to as measurable or minimal residual disease (MRD), after induction therapy or at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is highly predictive for adverse clinical outcomes and can be used to identify patients likely to experience clinically evident relapse. As a result of inherent genetic and molecular heterogeneity in AML, there is no uniform method or protocol for MRD measurement to encompass all cases. Several techniques focusing on identifying recurrent molecular and cytogenetic aberrations or leukemia-associated immunophenotypes have been described, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Modern technologies enabling the digital quantification and tracking of individual DNA or RNA molecules, next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, and high-resolution imaging capabilities are among several new avenues under development to supplement or replace the current standard of flow cytometry.

This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database and conducted following the PRISMA Statements. The MeSH terms, Sesquiterpenes, Lactones and Leukemia were used in four databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and Bireme). There were 281 studies selected, but after exclusions, due to replication (n = 172) or not following PECOS criteria (n = 24), 148 studies remained. Of the 148 articles, only 22 were submitted to quality assessment and were scored in high level if more than two techniques, to elucidate antileukemic properties, were described, and then data were extracted. The studies mostly used human leukemia cell lines including primary and established cells, with or without chemotherapy resistance. The SLs used were obtained principally from plants. The antileukemic properties of SLs were extracted from 22 high level studies. They included cell death induction, mainly by apoptosis, as well as cell differentiation, cell cycle disruption, leukemia cancer stem cell growth inhibition and NF-kappaB pathway inhibition; the latter is a promising therapeutic target for lymphoid malignancies. We concluded that, in spite of the necessity of better toxicological profile characterization of SLs, the antileukemic properties of these compounds support the proposal that the SLs are promising candidates for the treatment of leukemia.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NF-kappaB', '*Natural products', '*apoptosis', '*cancer stem cell', '*cell cycle', '*differentiation', '*leukemia', '*sesquiterpene lactones.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the synthesized molecules were screened against a panel of human carcinoma cell lines. DESCRIPTION: Significant inhibition was exhibited by the compounds against HCT-116 (Colon) and PC-3 (Prostate) cell lines while A-549 (Lung) cell lines, MiaPaCa-2 (Pancreatic) cell lines and HL-60 (Leukemia Cancer) cell lines were almost resistant to the exposure of the test compounds. Compound FP-(v)n displayed noteworthy cytotoxicity towards HCT-116 malignant cells with the IC50 value of 0.67 microM. It induces apoptosis as revealed by several biological endpoints like apoptotic body formation, through DAPI staining, phase contrast microscopy and mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Moreover FP-(v)n is a potent apoptotic inducer confirmed by cell cycle arrest and ROS generation. The cell phase distribution studies indicate an augment from 4.94 % (control sample) to 39.68 % (sample treated with 1.5 microM compound FP-(v)n) in the apoptotic population. Compound FP-(v)n inhibits the tumor growth in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC), Ehrlich Tumor (ET, solid) and sarcoma-180 (solid) mice models. Additionally, it was established to be non-toxic at maximum tolerated dose of 1000 mg/kg in acute oral toxicity in Swiss-albino mice. CONCLUSION: The current study provides an insight into anti-cancer potential of FP-(v)n, which might be valuable in the treatment of tumor.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*acute toxicity', '*anti-cancer efficacy.', '*cell cycle', '*cell lines', '*cytotoxicity', '*pyrans', '*sarcoma-180']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a potent inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor and is elevated in many human cancers that retain wild-type p53. MDM2 SNP309G is a functional polymorphism that results in elevated levels of MDM2 (due to enhanced SP1 binding to the MDM2 promoter) thus decreasing p53 activity. Mdm2(SNP309G/G) mice are more prone to spontaneous tumor formation than Mdm2(SNP309T/T) mice, providing direct evidence for the impact of this SNP in tumor development. We asked whether environmental factors impact SNP309G function and show that SNP309G cooperates with ionizing radiation to exacerbate tumor development. Surprisingly, ultraviolet B light or Benzo(a)pyrene exposure of skin shows that SNP309G allele actually protects against squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility. These contrasting differences led us to interrogate the mechanism by which Mdm2 SNP309 regulates tumor susceptibility in a tissue-specific manner. Although basal Mdm2 levels were significantly higher in most tissues in Mdm2(SNP309G/G) mice compared with Mdm2(SNP309T/T) mice, they were significantly lower in Mdm2(SNP309G/G) keratinocytes, the cell-type susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma. The assessment of potential transcriptional regulators in ENCODE ChIP-seq database identified transcriptional repressor E2F6 as a possible negative regulator of MDM2 expression. Our data show that E2F6 suppresses Mdm2 expression in cells harboring the SNP309G allele but not the SNP309T allele. Thus, Mdm2 SNP309G exhibits tissue-specific regulation and differentially impacts cancer risk.",,,,PMC5775049,"['R01 CA047296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES015587/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS912708'],,,,,,,

The role of preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan for these patients is unclear. We compared preoperative PET/CT with final histopathology among patients undergoing lymphadenectomy and/or parotidectomy for HNcSCC-M0. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Single Australian center. Subjects and Methods Investigation included disease parameters and preoperative CT and PET/CT findings of 64 patients with node-positive HNcSCC without distant metastatic disease. Fisher's exact test was used to test for a difference in the proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia between the false- and true-negative PET/CT subgroups. Results Of 64 patients who underwent PET/CT prior to surgery for node-positive HNcSCC-M0, 56 underwent a neck dissection and 30, a parotidectomy. Of these, 13 neck dissections and 2 parotidectomies were performed in the absence of FDG-avid (18F-fludeoxyglucose) nodes in these nodal fields. The PET/CT positive predictive value of the neck was 91.1%. The negative predictive values in the neck and parotid regions were 60%. Of the false-negative subgroup, 66.7% had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, compared with 11.1% of the true-negative subgroup ( P = .09). Based on PET/CT findings, surgical plans according to preoperative CT were changed for 6.25% of patients. Conclusion Use of PET/CT for surgical candidates with node-positive HNcSCC-M0 has high specificity and positive predictive value with relatively low sensitivity and negative predictive value. A statistical trend toward a higher rate of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among patients with false-negative results is suggested.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*PET/CT scan', '*accuracy analysis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma', '*radiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"The objective of this study was to examine the association between personal use of hair dyes and the risk of leukemia. We conducted a systematic literature review of epidemiology studies reporting leukemia-specific cancer risks among hair dye users, and estimated the meta-relative risk (meta-RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of leukemia, comparing hair dye users to nonusers. When data from all 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria were combined, ever use of hair dye was associated with a nonstatistically significant increased risk of leukemia, meta-RR = 1.09 (95% CI: 0.97-1.22). When restricted to studies that adjusted for smoking, ever use of hair dye was not associated with leukemia, meta-RR = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.76-1.29). A statistically significant increased risk of leukemia was associated with permanent hair dye use (meta-RR = 1.19 [95% CI: 1.07-1.33]), dark hair dye use (meta-RR = 1.29 [95% CI: 1.11-1.50]), hair dye use among males (meta-RR = 1.42 [95% CI: 1.01-2.00]), hair dye use pre-1980 (meta-RR = 1.49 [95% CI: 1.21-1.83]), and hair dye use for >/=15 years (meta-RR = 1.35 [95% CI: 1.13-1.62]). Overall, findings suggest that ever use of hair dye is not a significant risk factor for leukemia. Certain hair dye use characteristics were associated with a statistically significant increased risk, but further research is required to determine whether these associations truly reflect a risk of leukemia due to methodological limitations in the underlying studies.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Therefore, a better understanding of ATO resistance mechanism is required. In this study, we established an ATO-resistant human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, KB/ATO, from its parental KB-3-1 cells. In addition to ATO, KB/ATO cells also exhibited cross-resistance to other anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, antimony potassium tartrate, and 6-mercaptopurine. The arsenic accumulation in KB/ATO cells was significantly lower than that in KB-3-1 cells. Further analysis indicated that neither application of P-glycoprotein inhibitor, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) inhibitor, or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) inhibitor could eliminate ATO resistance.

However, its anti-human leukemia effects in NB4 cells remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of VP on proliferation and apoptosis in human leukemia NB4 cells. Methods: NB4 cells were treated with VP for 24 h. The effects of VP on cell proliferation were determined using a Cell-Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK-8) assay and colony forming assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). The protein levels were detected by western blot. Results: We found that VP inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. FCM analysis showed that VP induced apoptosis in a concentration dependent manner and that VP treatment led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Moreover, VP significantly decreased the protein expression of YAP, p-YAP, Survivin, c-Myc, cyclinD1, p-ERK, and p-AKT. In addition, VP increased the protein expression of cleaved caspase3, cleaved PARP, Bax, and p-p38 MAPK. Conclusions: VP inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in NB4 cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['NB4 cells', 'Verteporfin', 'YAP', 'apoptosis.', 'proliferation']",PMC5599928,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,

She presented with blurred vision, vertigo, exertional dyspnoea and insomnia. She did not show the typical features of Turner syndrome, but her cytogenetis confirmed the diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy showed diffuse infiltration of blast cells with cellularity around 80-85% and haematopoietic suppression. Karyotype analysis showed: 45 X, -X, t (8; 21) (q22; q22) [According to The International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN)]. Turner syndrome is caused by partial or complete absence of second X chromosome in a female. It is known to have Cardiovascular and Reproductive complications but it is rare to find haematologic malignancies.

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"Genome studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have revealed the remarkable subclonal heterogeneity of the tumors, but the clinical implications of this phenomenon are not well known. We assessed the mutational status of 28 CLL driver genes by deep-targeted next-generation sequencing and copy number alterations (CNA) in 406 previously untreated patients and 48 sequential samples. We detected small subclonal mutations (0.6-25% of cells) in nearly all genes (26/28), and they were the sole alteration in 22% of the mutated cases. CNA tended to be acquired early in the evolution of the disease and remained stable, whereas the mutational heterogeneity increased in a subset of tumors. The prognostic impact of different genes was related to the size of the mutated clone. Combining mutations and CNA, we observed that the accumulation of driver alterations (mutational complexity) gradually shortened the time to first treatment independently of the clonal architecture, IGHV status and Binet stage. Conversely, the overall survival was associated with the increasing subclonal diversity of the tumors but it was related to the age of patients, IGHV and TP53 status of the tumors. In conclusion, our study reveals that both the mutational complexity and subclonal diversity influence the evolution of CLL.",,,,PMC5843898,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that 14-3-3zeta binds the 11S proteasome activator, limiting proteasome assembly and cellular capacity for protein degradation. To define the functional impact of 14-3-3zeta proteasomal binding in myeloma cells, silencing and overexpression experiments are performed. We find that downregulation of 14-3-3zeta impairs myeloma cell growth and confers resistance to clinically used proteasome inhibitors. In a large cohort of newly diagnosed myeloma patients, elevated expression of 14-3-3zeta is associated with high risk myeloma genetic subtypes and worse prognosis overall.

The antileukemic potential of clerodane diterpene from Polyalthia longifolia leaves has already been established. However, in this present study, utilizing chromatographic techniques we report for the first time, the isolation of a rare tetranorditerpene (compound 1) from P. longifolia. The structure of compound 1 was elucidated and confirmed by spectrophotometric data. UPLC-MS analysis was conducted on the methanolic extract, ethyl acetate fraction, and isolated tetranorditerpene showed that the tetranorditerpene is one of the major constituents of the plant with a retention time of 30.78 min. In addition, a methyl ester derivative (compound 2) of the isolated tetranorditerpene was synthesized. Using the CCK-8 assay, we compared the cytotoxic potential of isolated tetranorditerpene (1) and methyl ester derivative (2) with the previously isolated clerodane diterpenes. Our results showed that the methyl ester derivative (2) displayed the highest inhibitory activity against human leukemia HL-60 cells. The isolated tetranorditerpene (1) did not exhibit significant inhibitory effect against HL-60 cells. Morphological examination indicated chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation suggesting induction of apoptosis in compound 2 treated HL-60 cells. The methyl esterification of the isolated tetranorditerpene (1) conferred on it a significant level of antileukemic activity suggesting the possibility of a synergistic relationship between pure compound isolation and synthetic reaction in the discovery of new chemopreventive agents.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Polyalthia longifolia', 'antileukemic activity', 'human leukemic HL-60 cells', 'tetranorditerpene']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"Loss of miR-15/16 is the most common genetic lesion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), promoting overexpression of BCL2, which factors in leukemia pathogenesis. Indeed, an inhibitor of Bcl2, venetoclcax, is highly active in the treatment of patients with CLL. However, single-agent venetoclcax fails to eradicate minimal residual disease in most patients. Accordingly, we were interested in other genes that may be regulated by miR-15/16, which may target other drivers in CLL. We found that miR-15/16 targets ROR1, which encodes an onco-embryonic surface protein expressed on the CLL cells of over 90% of patients, but not on virtually all normal postpartum tissues. CLL with high-level expression of ROR1 also have high-level expression of Bcl2, but low-to-negligible miR-15/16 Moreover, CLL cases with high-level ROR1 have deletion(s) at the chromosomal location of the genes encoding miR-15/16 (13q14) more frequently than cases with low-to-negligible ROR1, implying that deletion of miR-15/16 may promote overexpression of ROR1, in addition to BCL2 ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a, which can promote leukemia-cell proliferation and survival, and can be targeted by cirmtuzumab, a humanized anti-ROR1 mAb. We find that this mAb can enhance the in vitro cytotoxic activity of venetoclcax for CLL cells with high-level expression of ROR1, indicating that combining these agents, which target ROR1 and Bcl2, may have additive, if not synergistic, activity in patients with this disease.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Blc2', '*CLL', '*ROR1', '*miR-15/16', '*venetoclax']",PMC5635897,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Conflict of interest statement: Cirmtuzumab was developed in the T.J.K.', 'laboratory and licensed by Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. from the University of', 'California, San Diego.']",,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"Karyotype (KT) aberrations are important prognostic factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, around 50% of cases present normal results. Single nucleotide polymorphism array can detect chromosomal gains, losses or uniparental disomy that are invisible to KT, thus improving patients' risk assessment. However, when both tests are normal, important driver mutations can be detected by the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Fourteen adult patients with AML with normal cytogenetics were investigated by NGS for 19 AML-related genes. Every patient presented at least one mutation: DNMT3A in nine patients; IDH2 in six; IDH1 in three; NRAS and NPM1 in two; and TET2, ASXL1, PTPN11, and RUNX1 in one patient. No mutations were found in FLT3, KIT, JAK2, CEBPA, GATA2, TP53, BRAF, CBL, KRAS, and WT1 genes. Twelve patients (86%) had at least one mutation in genes related with DNA methylation (DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2), which is involved in regulation of gene expression and genomic stability. All patients could be reclassified based on genomic status and nine had their prognosis modified. In summary, NGS offers insights into the molecular pathogenesis and biology of cytogenetically normal AML in Brazilian patients, indicating that the prognosis could be further stratified by different mutation combinations. This study shows a different frequency of mutations in Brazilian population that should be confirmed.","['(c) American Federation for Medical Research (unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been tested extensively to limited benefit in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) leukemia cells exhibit mechanisms of intrinsic signaling adaptation to TKI treatment that are associated with an incomplete response. Here, we identified reactivation of ERK signaling within hours following treatment of FLT3/ITD AML cells with selective inhibitors of FLT3. When these cells were treated with inhibitors of both FLT3 and MEK in combination, ERK reactivation was abrogated and anti-leukemia effects were more pronounced compared with either drug alone. ERK reactivation was also observed following inhibition of other tyrosine kinase-driven cancer cells, including EGFR-mutant lung cancer, HER2-amplified breast cancer, and BCR-ABL leukemia.

Epub 2017 Aug 15.,"INTRODUCTION: Although treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has evolved dramatically during the past decades, especially with the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid, risk stratification remains an important issue. To date, relapse risk can be predicted by leukocyte and platelet counts only. In the present report, we present a validation study on 3 candidate genes and a newly developed molecular risk score for APL in 2 independent patient cohorts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An integrative risk score combining the expression levels of BAALC, ERG, and WT1 was calculated for 79 de novo APL patients from the original cohort and 76 de novo APL patients from a validation cohort. Gene expression analysis was executed the same for both cohorts, and the results regarding the effect on patient outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The expression levels of BAALC, ERG, and WT1 were similar in both cohorts compared with the healthy controls. The relapse and survival rates were not different between the low- and high-risk patients according to the Sanz score. However, application of the molecular risk score on the validation cohort distinctly discriminated patients according to their risk of relapse and death just as in the original APL cohort, although single gene analyses could not reproduce the negative prognostic impact. CONCLUSION: The analysis clearly validated the prognostic effect of the integrative risk score on the outcome in APL patients. The value was further empowered because the single gene analyses did not show similar results. Whether the integrative risk score retains its prognostic power in the chemotherapy-free setting should be investigated further.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of everolimus (EVR) on HCV replication activity in the context of underlying molecular mechanisms, with focus on the pro-myelocytic leukemia protein (PML). METHODS: HCV viral load was recorded in 40 patients with post-transplant HCV re-infection before and 8 weeks after introduction of EVR. An HCV cell culture replicon system for genotype (GT) 1b, GT2b, and GT3a was used to compare the influence of EVR on HCV replication for the respective genotypes in vitro. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis was used to test for effects on cell proliferation. PML expression was silenced with the use of small hairpin RNA constructs, and PML expression was quantified by means of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In patients with HCV, the viral load of GT1a and GT1b was hardly affected by EVR, whereas the viral load was reduced in patients with GT2a (P </= .0001) or GT3 infection (P </= .05). In vitro EVR impairs HCV replication activity of GT2a and GT3a up to 60% (P </= .0005), whereas in GT1b cells, HCV replication activity is increased by 50% (P </= .005). Replicon cell viability was not impaired. HCV replication activity is impaired in the absence of PML, which can be reversed by overexpression of PML isoforms. Furthermore, in the absence of PML, the effect of EVR on HCV replication activity is nearly abrogated. CONCLUSIONS: The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor EVR influences HCV replication via PML. The herein presented results suggest a genotype-dependent benefit for an EVR-based immunosuppressive regimen in patients with GT2a or GT3 re-infection after liver transplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

S-Alkyl substituted N-aminothioglycolurils were prepared through alkylation of corresponding thioglycolurils with iodoalkane or 4-chlorobenzylchloride. Methylthio group in S-methyl derivatives can be substituted with hydroxyl group in acid medium to give N-aminoglycolurils. Representative compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against RD, A549, HCT116 and MCF7 human cancer cell lines by MTT-assay and screened for their antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi using the mycelium growth inhibition method in vitro. Among the derivatives, 4-((E)-((E)-3-(2-Methoxyphenyl)allylidene)amino)-3-methyl-1-phenylthioglycoluril 8i was found to have the highest antiproliferative activity toward the RD and HCT116 cell lines (8i: IC50 = 0.02 and 0.012 muM, respectively), which exceeded cytotoxicity of reference drugs. 1,3-Diethyl-4-((E)-((E)-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)allylidene)amino)thioglycoluril 8l showed the most marked activity toward A549 cells (8l: IC50 = 0.61 muM) compared to reference drugs. The IC50 values of thioglycolurils 8i,l against normal human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 were 0.23 and 86.11 muM, respectively, exceeding the IC50 values of this compound toward the RD, HCT116 (8i) and A549 cells (8l) by one-two orders of magnitude.

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant hematological disease afflicting hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. While 80%-90% of patients diagnosed with ALL will achieve complete remission at some point during treatment, ALL is associated with high relapse rate, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 68%. The initial remission failure and the high rate of relapse can be attributed to intrinsic chemoprotective mechanisms that allow persistence of ALL cells despite therapy. These mechanisms are mediated, at least in part, through the engagement of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) within the bone marrow microenvironment. This review assembles CAMs implicated in protection of leukemic cells from chemotherapy. Such studies are limited in ALL. Therefore, CAMs that are associated with poor outcomes or are overexpressed in ALL and have been shown to be involved in chemoprotection in other hematological cancers are also included. It is likely that these molecules play parallel roles in ALL because the CAMs identified to be a factor in ALL chemoresistance also work similarly in other hematological malignancies. We review the signaling mechanisms activated by the engagement of CAMs that provide protection from chemotherapy.

A recent report suggested that cancer chemotherapy might increase the risk for the intestinal toxemia botulism in both adults and children. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 5-year-old boy, who developed general muscle weakness, constipation, ptosis and mydriasis during the third induction therapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. He had recent histories of multiple antibiotic therapy for bacteremia and intake of well water at home. Repeated bacterial cultures identified Clostridium botulinum producing botulinum neurotoxin A. Botulinum toxin A was isolated from his stools at 17, 21, and 23 days after the onset. Symptoms were self-limiting, and were fully recovered without anti-botulinum toxin globulin therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the second report of a pediatric case with cancer chemotherapy-associated intestinal toxemia botulism. Our case provides further evidence that the immunocompromised status due to anti-cancer treatments increases the risk for the development of botulism at all ages in childhood.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Antibiotics', 'Chemotherapy', 'Childhood', 'Intestinal toxemia botulism']",PMC5604400,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics (continuous intravenous infusion) from a phase 2 study (n = 189; NCT01466179) were assessed noncompartmentally. Associations between steady-state concentration (Css ) and efficacy (complete remission [CR] or CR with partial hematologic recovery [CRh]) or safety (cytokine release syndrome [CRS] and neurologic events [NEs]) were evaluated with statistical models. Blinatumomab mean +/- SD Css was 621 +/- 502 pg/mL (28 mug/day dose). Cytokines were transiently elevated in >50% of patients; B-cell levels decreased in most patients. Lower B-cell and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages and higher T-cell percentages were associated with higher CR/CRh (P < .001) in univariate analysis. Higher Css (OR, 1.90; 95%CI, 1.12-3.21), higher peak IL-10 level (1.59; 1.13-2.22), and lower BM blast percentage (0.78; 0.69-0.89) were associated with higher CR/CRh in multivariate analysis. Higher Css (HR, 1.40; 1.01-1.94) and lower B-cell level (0.90; 0.84-0.97) were associated with shorter time to NEs. Cytokine peaks were not associated with NEs or CRS. In conclusion, blinatumomab led to T cell-mediated depletion of target B cells in blood and blasts in the bone marrow.

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"OBJECTIVES: Recent guidelines recommend to assess emotional distress in pediatric oncology during treatment and in after care. One tool used to do this is the distress thermometer (DT), a simple tool which has almost exclusively been studied in its screening abilities. Given its increased used as a measure of distress per se, it is necessary to document its concurrent validity. The goal of this study was to identify clinical domains (eg, depression, anxiety) and individual symptoms associated with pediatric cancer survivors' rating on the DT. PARTICIPANTS: To do so we used data collected from 84 young (</=18 years old), and 120 older (>18 years old) survivors who were treated for pediatric leukemia. METHODS: Participants responded to self-report questionnaires as part of a research visit. RESULTS: Results from stepwise regressions show that in the younger group, high scores on the thermometer were associated with higher negative affectivity only. In adults, high scores were associated with higher anxiety, higher negative affectivity, and lower positive affectivity. When exploring associations with individual items, we found that the main emotional tone reflected by the thermometer score was anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Interpreting ratings on the thermometer should probably focus on anxiety in childhood cancer survivors. This widely used tool also does not measure the same domains in young versus older survivors, so that age groups should be considered separately in future work.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Affects, after care', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'emotional distress', 'pediatric cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a comprehensive genetic analysis of a patient with KMT2A-rearranged DCL after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for refractory cytopenia of childhood. PROCEDURE: We performed a whole-exome sequencing of the recipient's peripheral blood before transplant and the donor's peripheral blood and the recipient's bone marrow at the time of DCL diagnosis. RNA sequencing was also performed to detect fusion genes in DCL blasts. RESULTS: There were no germline mutations that were associated with a predisposition to leukemia in the recipient and donor. Furthermore, there were no detectable somatic alterations except KMT2A-MLLT10 and other related gene fusions in DCL. KMT2A-MLLT10 was not detectable in the donor's bone marrow.

It has shown to have various biological activities including antitumor activity. The present study aims to investigate the cytotoxic potential of chebulinic acid in human myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, chebulinic acid caused apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and NB4 cells but not K562 cells. In vitro antitumor effects of chebulinic acid were investigated by using various acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Chebulinic acid treatment to HL-60 and NB4 cells induced caspase activation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Additionally, inhibition of caspase activation drastically reduced the chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Our data also demonstrate that chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells involves activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, which, when inhibited with ERK inhibitor PD98059, mitigates the chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings exhibit the selective potentiation of chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.

Epub 2017 Oct 9.,"B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a key for survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and BCR signaling inhibitors are clinically active. However, relapse and resistance to treatment require novel treatment options. To detect novel candidate therapeutic targets, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation screen with custom arrays and identified aberrant promoter DNA methylation in 2,192 genes. The transcription factor NFATC1 that is a downstream effector of BCR signaling was among the top hypomethylated genes and was concomitantly transcriptionally upregulated in CLL. Intriguingly, NFATC1 promoter DNA hypomethylation levels were significantly variant in clinical trial cohorts from different disease progression stages and furthermore correlated with Binet disease staging and thymidine kinase levels, strongly suggesting a central role of NFATC1 in CLL development. Functionally, DNA hypomethylation at NFATC1 promoter inversely correlated with RNA levels of NFATC1 and dysregulation correlated with expression of target genes BCL-2, CCND1 and CCR7. The inhibition of the NFAT regulator calcineurin with tacrolimus and cyclosporin A and the BCR signaling inhibitor ibrutinib significantly reduced NFAT activity in leukemic cell lines, and NFAT inhibition resulted in increased apoptosis of primary CLL cells. In summary, our results indicate that the aberrant activation of NFATC1 by DNA hypomethylation and BCR signaling plays a major role in the pathomechanism of CLL.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR signaling', '*NFATC1', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib', '*methylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with imatinib mesylate and other second- and/or third-generation c-Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has substantially extended patient survival. However, TKIs primarily target differentiated cells and do not eliminate leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Therefore, targeting minimal residual disease to prevent acquired resistance and/or disease relapse requires identification of new LSC-selective target(s) that can be exploited therapeutically. Considering that malignant transformation involves cellular metabolic changes, which may in turn render the transformed cells susceptible to specific assaults in a selective manner, we searched for such vulnerabilities in CML LSCs. We performed metabolic analyses on both stem cell-enriched (CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)) and differentiated (CD34(-)) cells derived from individuals with CML, and we compared the signature of these cells with that of their normal counterparts. Through combination of stable isotope-assisted metabolomics with functional assays, we demonstrate that primitive CML cells rely on upregulated oxidative metabolism for their survival.

Epub 2017 Sep 18.,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an abundant nucleotide modification in mRNA that is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. However, it remains unknown whether the m(6)A modification controls the differentiation of normal and/or malignant myeloid hematopoietic cells. Here we show that shRNA-mediated depletion of the m(6)A-forming enzyme METTL3 in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) promotes cell differentiation, coupled with reduced cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type METTL3, but not of a catalytically inactive form of METTL3, inhibits cell differentiation and increases cell growth. METTL3 mRNA and protein are expressed more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than in healthy HSPCs or other types of tumor cells. Furthermore, METTL3 depletion in human myeloid leukemia cell lines induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and delays leukemia progression in recipient mice in vivo. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m(6)A coupled with ribosome profiling reveals that m(6)A promotes the translation of c-MYC, BCL2 and PTEN mRNAs in the human acute myeloid leukemia MOLM-13 cell line. Moreover, loss of METTL3 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which contributes to the differentiation-promoting effects of METTL3 depletion. Overall, these results provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of METTL3 in myeloid leukemia.",,,,PMC5677536,"['F32 CA221104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA186702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA062948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS904710'],,"['Nat Med. 2017 Nov 7;23(11):1252-1254.

The majority of these functions are played through the interactions with a variety of protein partners. NPM1 is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors of different histological origin. Furthermore NPM1 is the most frequently mutated protein in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Mutations map to the C-terminal domain and lead to the aberrant and stable localization of the protein in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts. Among NPM1 protein partners, a pivotal role is played by the tumor suppressor Fbw7gamma, an E3-ubiquitin ligase that degrades oncoproteins like c-MYC, cyclin E, Notch and c-jun. In AML with NPM1 mutations, Fbw7gamma is degraded following its abnormal cytosolic delocalization by mutated NPM1. This mechanism also applies to other tumor suppressors and it has been suggested that it may play a key role in leukemogenesis. Here we analyse the interaction between NPM1 and Fbw7gamma, by identifying the protein surfaces implicated in recognition and key aminoacids involved. Based on the results of computational methods, we propose a structural model for the interaction, which is substantiated by experimental findings on several site-directed mutants. We also extend the analysis to two other NPM1 partners (HIV Tat and CENP-W) and conclude that NPM1 uses the same molecular surface as a platform for recognizing different protein partners. We suggest that this region of NPM1 may be targeted for cancer treatment.",,,,PMC5623904,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, no wt-p53 and survivin modulating drugs have been approved for clinical application in ALL. Here, we investigated if in vitro eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations equal to human plasma levels are able to target wt-p53 and survivin. METHODS: Wt-p53 Molt-4 cells (ALL cell line) were treated with 50, 100, 150, and 200 microM of EPA after which cell number, viability, proliferation rate, survivin expression, wt-p53 accumulation, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis were evaluated. RESULTS: After 48- and 72-h treatments with EPA at concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 microM, cell proliferation rates were measured to be 71.5-32.6% and 68.2-13.7% and metabolic activities were measured to be 77-44% and 71-26%, respectively. Treatment with 50-200 microM of EPA for 48 h resulted in 14.1-74.6% and 69.5-45.5% decreases in survivin mRNA and protein levels, respectively. EPA induced 1.3-6 and 1.9-20-fold increases in caspase-3 activation and wt-p53 accumulation, respectively. Increase in wt-p53/survivin and caspase-3/survivin ratios from 1 in untreated cells to 20.3 and 5.8 was measured for 150 microM of EPA. Low necrotic rates ranging from 0.3% to 2.8% and an increase in the number of total apoptotic cells (early + late) ranging from 9.8% to 81% were also observed with increasing EPA concentrations. CONCLUSION: EPA induces strongly wt-p53 with a remarkable decrease in survivin expression, representing an attractive compound to modulate wt-p53 and survivin in ALL cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'cell proliferation', 'eicosapentaenoic acid', 'survivin', 'wild-type p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 14.,"BACKGROUND: HTLV-I infection is associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a malignancy characterized by a high rate of disease relapse and poor survival. Previous studies reported the existence of side population (SP) cells in HTLV-I Tax transgenic mouse models. These studies showed that these ATL-like derived SP cells have both self-renewal and leukemia renewal capacity and represent Cancer Stem Cells (CSC)/Leukemia-Initiating Cells (LIC). Since CSC/LIC are resistant to conventional therapies, a better characterization is needed. METHODS: We isolated, sorted and characterized SP cells from uncultured PBMCs from ATL patients and from ATL patient-derived cell lines. We then identified several specific signaling pathways activated or suppressed in these cells. Expression of viral gene HBZ and Tax transcriptional activity was also investigated. Using gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI, Calbiochem) and stably transduced ATL cell lines expressing TET-inducible NOTCH 1 intracellular domain (NICD), we characterized the role of activated NOTCH 1 in the maintenance of the SP cells in ATL. RESULTS: Our studies confirm the existence of SP cells in ATL samples. These cells demonstrate lower activation of NOTCH1 and Tax, and reduced expression of STAT3, beta-catenin/Wnt3 and viral HBZ. We further show that PI3K and the NOTCH1 signaling pathway have opposite functions, and constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling depletes the pool of SP cells in ATL-derived cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in ATL, a balance between activation of the NOTCH1 and PI3K signaling pathway is the key in the control of SP cells maintenance and may offer therapeutic opportunities.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-I', 'NOTCH', 'PI3K', 'Side population (SP) cells']",PMC5596512,"['R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI103851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Author declares no financial conflict of interest and would like to thank Brandi', 'Miller for editorial assistance.']",,,['NIHMS899712'],,,,,,,

As oncologic medical care is provided by federal state-owned, specialized medical institutions, the cost estimation in this study primarily informs from a state budget perspective. Patients' contributions to medical costs were not included in the cost evaluation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multinational, multicenter, retrospective study conducted in eight specialized centers (four in Russia, three in Ukraine, and one in Kazakhstan). The investigators captured data from the medical documents of all adult patients with an established CLL diagnosis before December 31, 2013, and who made at least one visit to their respective center between January 1 and December 31, 2013. RESULTS: A total of 319 adult CLL patients were enrolled (124 in Kazakhstan, 106 in Russia, and 89 in Ukraine). In 2013, the DMCs of CLL management (without CLL therapy) were euro215.40 in Kazakhstan, euro1,342.20 in Russia, and euro13,260.70 in Ukraine. Hospitalizations formed the largest proportion of total cost: 18.1%, 23.1%, and 40.4%, respectively. The mean cost of CLL medical treatment was euro13,580.60 (Russia), euro399.40 (Kazakhstan), and euro7,453.00 (Ukraine). CONCLUSION: CLL treatment standards varied across the selected countries; higher usage of biologic therapy was noted in Russia. Future research is needed to assess DMCs which include CLL treatment, which is another essential factor contributing to CLL DMCs.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Kazakhstan', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'direct medical cost', 'standard of care']",PMC5593418,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that TK1 is upregulated and localizes on the plasma membrane of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, T cell leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that TK1 localizes on the surface of Raji, HL60, and Jurkat cell lines and on ALL clinical samples. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found a strong association of TK1 with the plasma membrane in Raji, HL60, and Jurkat cell lines. These findings were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Our study also shows that this phenomenon does not occur on normal resting or proliferating lymphocytes. In addition, we show that membrane TK1 is found in all oligomeric forms ranging from monomer to tetramer and exhibits enzymatic activity.

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,"BACKGROUND: Historically considered to have very poor outcome, there is paucity of recent data regarding invasive mold infections (IMIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with hematologic cancer (HC) or stem cell transplantation (SCT). METHODS: We reviewed the records of HC patients and/or SCT recipients who were diagnosed with CNS IMIs (EORTC/MSG criteria) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (1/1/2000-6/31/2016). Risk factors for survival at day (d) 42 post diagnosis were assessed. RESULTS: We identified 40 such patients (16 with proven infection). The incidence density was 3.8 cases/100000 patient days and mortality remained stable throughout the study period. Most patients had active HC and neutropenia at diagnosis (95% and 53% respectively). Of the 25 patients with a microbiological diagnosis, Aspergillus spp and Mucorales accounted for 85% of cases. CNS IMIs were deemed to be secondary to hematogenous spread in 31 (77%), mostly (90%) fungal pneumonia. CNS lesions typically presented as solitary ring-enhancing abscesses in MRI (26; 65%). Most patients (34; 85%) received lipid AMB and were treated with combination therapy (33; 83%); Mortality 42d was 48%. In univariate analysis, lack of surgical drainage (p = 0.01), absence of giant cells (p = 0.01) and granulomas (p = 0.03) were associated with increased 42d mortality. In multivariate analysis, co-infection was associated with increased (p = 0.005), while steroid tapering was associated with decreased mortality (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although less lethal, improved outcome in these uncommon infections was related only to immune response in histopathology, steroid tapering and possibly surgical drainage. In a contemporary 16-year cohort of 40 patients with hematologic cancer and mold infections of Central Nervous System, 42-day mortality was 48%. Improved survival was related to immune response in histopathology, absence of co-infections, corticosteroid tapering and possibly surgical drainage.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The British Infection Association.

Epub 2017 Jul 14.,"The identification of oncogenic drivers of liquid tumors has led to the rapid development of targeted agents with distinct cutaneous adverse event (AE) profiles. The diagnosis and management of these skin toxicities has motivated a novel partnership between dermatologists and oncologists in developing supportive oncodermatology clinics. In this article we review the current state of knowledge of clinical presentation, mechanisms, and management of the most common and significant cutaneous AEs observed during treatment with targeted therapies for hematologic and lymphoid malignancies. We systematically review according to drug-targeting pathway the cutaneous AE profiles of these drugs, and offer insight when possible into whether pharmacologic target versus immunologic modulation primarily underlie presentation. We include discussion of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib), blinatumomab, ibrutinib, idelalisib, anti-B cell antibodies (rituximab, ibritumomab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, tositumomab), immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), alemtuzumab, brentuximab, and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib). We highlight skin reactions seen with antiliquid but not solid tumor agents, draw attention to serious cutaneous AEs that might require therapy modification or cessation, and offer management strategies to permit treatment tolerability. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to minimize disruptions to care, optimize prognosis and quality of life, and promptly address life-threatening skin or infectious events. This evolving partnership between oncologists and dermatologists in the iterative characterization and management of skin toxicities will contribute to a better understanding of these drugs' cutaneous targets and improved patient care.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We therefore designed two semi-purified diets, namely DHA-free (control) and DHA-supplemented, and fed them to grass carp (22.19 +/- 1.76 g) for 3 and 6 weeks. DHA supplementation led to a significantly lower intraperitoneal fat index (IPFI) than that in the control group by reducing the number of adipocytes but significantly higher adipocyte size (P < 0.05). In the intraperitoneal adipose tissue, the DHA-fed group showed significantly higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)1c mRNA expression levels at both 3 and 6 weeks (P < 0.05). However, the ratio of the expression levels of B cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was significantly lower in the DHA-fed group than in the control group (P < 0.05), and the protein expression levels of the apoptosis-related proteins caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 were also significantly higher (P < 0.05). Overall, although DHA promotes lipid synthesis, it is more likely that DHA could suppress the lipid accumulation in adipocytes of grass carp by inducing adipocyte apoptosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose tissue', 'Apoptosis', 'Ctenopharyngodon idella', 'Docosahexaenoic acid']",,['31372538/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,,,,,,,

Known targets of mIRs that were significantly different in AML-derived MSC exosomes compared to controls were identified. Of the five candidate miRs identified by differential packaging in exosomes, only miR-26a-5p and miR-101-3p were significantly increased in AML-derived samples while miR-23b-5p, miR-339-3p and miR-425-5p were significantly decreased. Validation of the predicted change in gene expression of the potential targets was investigated by interrogating gene expression levels from public datasets of marrow-derived CD34-selected cells from patients with AML (n = 69) and healthy donors (n = 40). Two molecules with decreased gene expression in AML (EZH2 and GSK3beta) were predicted by the miR profiling and have been previously implicated in AML while three molecules were increased in AML-derived cells and have not been previously associated with leukemogenesis (KRBA2, RRBP1 and HIST2H 2BE). In summary, profiling miRs in exosomes from AML-derived MSCs allowed us to identify candidate miRs with potential relevance in AML that could yield new insights regarding leukemogenesis or new treatment strategies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bone marrow', '*Exosome', '*Mesenchymal stromal cells', '*MicroRNA']",PMC5730624,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 16.,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ) analogs with variable numbers of isoprenoid units have been demonstrated as anticancer and antioxidant/pro-oxidant molecules. This study examined the in vitro and in vivo antitumor and apoptosis activities of CoQ0 (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, zero isoprenoid side-chains) through upregulation of the Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) signaling pathway on human promyelocytic leukemia. CoQ0 (0-40 mug/mL) treatment significantly reduced HL-60 cell viability, and up-regulated mitochondrial VDAC1 expression. CoQ0 treatment triggers intracellular ROS generation, calcium release, DeltaPsim collapse and PTP opening in HL-60 cells. CoQ0 treatment induced apoptosis, which was associated with DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 and PARP activation, and Bax/Bcl-2 dysregulation. Annexin V-PI staining indicated that CoQ0 promotes late apoptosis. Furthermore, the blockade of CoQ0-induced ROS production by antioxidant NAC pretreatment substantially attenuated CoQ0-induced apoptosis. The activation of p-GSK3beta expression, cyclophilin D inhibition, and p53 activation through ROS are involved in CoQ0-induced HL-60 apoptotic cell death. Notably, ROS-independent p38 activation is involved in CoQ0-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In addition, the silencing of VDAC1 also prevented CoQ0-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax, activation of caspase-3, and reduction in Bcl-2. Intriguingly, VDAC1 silencing did not prevent ROS production induced by CoQ0, which in turn indicates that CoQ0 induced ROS-mediated VDAC1 and then mitochondrial apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In vivo results revealed that CoQ0 is effective in delaying tumor incidence and reducing the tumor burden in HL-60-xenografted nude mice. Taken together, CoQ0 could be a promising anticancer agent for the treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia through upregulation of VDAC1 signaling pathways.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'CoQ0', 'PTP opening', 'ROS', 'VDAC1']",,"['MOST-104-2320-B-039-040-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'MOST-103-2320-B-039-038-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'NSC-103-2622-B-039-001-CC2/National Science Council', 'CHM106-5-3/China Medical University Hospital']",,,,,,,,,,,

All cats presented at each centre between August 2011 and August 2012 were subjected to a patient-side test for FeLV/FIV on entry. Kittens under three months and cats euthanased within a short time of presentation were excluded from the study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to separately determine risk factors for FeLV and FIV infections. At shelter A, the prevalence of FIV infection was 11.4 per cent (54/474) and FeLV infection was 3 per cent (14/473), with two FIV/FeLV coinfections identified. At shelter B, the prevalence of FIV infection was 3 per cent (4/135) and FeLV infection was 0 per cent (0/135). Cats at shelter A were significantly more likely than those at shelter B to test positive for FIV (p=0.0024) and FeLV (p=0.048). Male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV (odds ratio 27.1, p=0.001), and thin body condition and musculoskeletal disease were associated with risk of FeLV. Overall, FIV-positive and FeLV-positive cats were significantly older (median ages 5.1 and 4.75 years, respectively) than the uninfected populations (median ages 3.4 and 3.5 years, respectively). This study shows that the prevalence of these diseases varies between shelter populations. Local knowledge combined with the risk factors identified may be useful in focusing resources for population testing strategies.","['(c) British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the', 'article) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with HLA-matched donors is increasingly used for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It remains unclear if haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) is a suitable option for older patients with this disease. We analyzed 43 patients with AML/MDS (median age, 61 years) who underwent a haploSCT at our institution. All patients received a fludarabine-melphalan-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Except for 1 patient who had early death, the remaining 42 patients (98%) engrafted donor cells. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III to IV acute GVHD at 6 months were 35% and 5%, respectively, and chronic GVHD at 2 years was 9%. After a median follow-up of 19 months, 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and relapse incidence were 42%, 42%, and 24%, respectively. Best PFS (74% at 2 years) was seen in patients with intermediate-/good-risk cytogenetics, in first or second remission (hazard ratio, .4; P = .05), and with a younger donor (</=40 years; hazard ratio, .2; P = .01). In conclusion, these data suggest that haploidentical transplantation is safe and effective for older AML/MDS patients. Disease status, cytogenetics, and younger donor age are predictors for improved survival in older patients receiving a haploidentical transplant.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that stable expression of SMO impaired formation of the integrated form of lentiviral DNA, but did not interrupt reverse transcription. This inhibition was evident in MT-4 and HUT102 human T cell lines expressing low levels of SMO mRNA, but not in SupT1 or Jurkat T cell lines expressing higher levels of SMO mRNA. Depletion of SMO mRNA in Jurkat cells facilitated HIV-1 vector infection, suggesting that endogenous SMO plays a role in limiting lentiviral infection.

We previously reported that FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation induced cell cycle arrest in MLL+ALL cells leading to resistance against anti-leukemic agents. Given that FL stimulation enhanced transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 mRNA levels in MLL+ALL cells, we extensively examined the effect of TGFbeta1 on the cell cycle progression and chemosensitivity in MLL+ALL cells, and found that TGFbeta1 stimulation induced MLL+ALL cells into cell cycle arrest resistant to arabinosyl cytosine; its effect was markedly enhanced in synergy with FL. Thus, it is likely that TGFbeta1 and FL, both abundantly produced by bone marrow stromal cells, function in a coordinated manner to render MLL+ALL cells chemoresistant, which should lead to the development of minimal residual disease (MRD) resulting in relapse.

Adult patients who had histologically confirmed AML and received induction therapy were enrolled. All patients underwent (18)F-FLT PET/CT after completion of induction. PET/CT images were visually and quantitatively assessed. Cases with intensely increased bone marrow uptake in more than one third of the long bones and throughout the central skeleton were interpreted as PET-positive for resistant disease (RD). PET results were compared to the clinical response and outcome. RESULTS: In visual PET analysis of 10 eligible patients (7 male, 3 female; median age 58 years), 5 patients were interpreted as being PET-positive and 5 as PET-negative. Standardized uptake values were significantly different between PET-positive and PET-negative groups. Eight of 10 patients achieved clinical complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). Five CR/CRi patients had PET-negative findings, but 3 CR patients had PET-positive findings. Both of the RD patients had PET-positive findings. During follow-up, 2 CR patients with PET-positive findings relapsed, or were strongly suspected of relapse, 4 months after consolidation. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FLT PET/CT after induction therapy showed good sensitivity and negative-predictive value for evaluating RD in patients with AML. This preliminary study suggests that (18)F-FLT PET/CT may be valuable as a noninvasive tool for early assessment of the response to treatment and may provide prognostic value for survival in patients with AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['18F-FLT', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bone marrow', 'Induction therapy', 'PET', 'Response assessment']",PMC5602811,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data showed that the levels of IL-17 increased from 6 h to 7 days and peaked at 3 days, in both the CNS and serum, which were consistent with the severity of secondary brain injury. The IL-23 inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) treatment markedly decreased the expressions of IL-17 and apoptosis-associated proteins cleaved caspase-3 and increased the protein ratio of Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2)/Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein). Meanwhile, neuronal apoptosis was reduced, and neural function was improved after SAHA treatment. This study suggests that IL-17 is involved in secondary brain injury after TBI.

Epub 2017 Sep 15.,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a constitutively active, ubiquitously expressed protein kinase that regulates multiple signaling pathways. In vitro kinase assays and genetic and pharmacological manipulations of GSK-3 have identified more than 100 putative GSK-3 substrates in diverse cell types. Many more have been predicted on the basis of a recurrent GSK-3 consensus motif ((pS/pT)XXX(S/T)), but this prediction has not been tested by analyzing the GSK-3 phosphoproteome. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) and MS techniques to analyze the repertoire of GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we found that approximately 2.4% of (pS/pT)XXX(S/T) sites are phosphorylated in a GSK-3-dependent manner. A comparison of WT and Gsk3a;Gsk3b knock-out (Gsk3 DKO) ESCs revealed prominent GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of multiple splicing factors and regulators of RNA biosynthesis as well as proteins that regulate transcription, translation, and cell division. Gsk3 DKO reduced phosphorylation of the splicing factors RBM8A, SRSF9, and PSF as well as the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and PHF6, and recombinant GSK-3beta phosphorylated these proteins in vitro RNA-Seq of WT and Gsk3 DKO ESCs identified approximately 190 genes that are alternatively spliced in a GSK-3-dependent manner, supporting a broad role for GSK-3 in regulating alternative splicing. The MS data also identified posttranscriptional regulation of protein abundance by GSK-3, with approximately 47 proteins (1.4%) whose levels increased and approximately 78 (2.4%) whose levels decreased in the absence of GSK-3. This study provides the first unbiased analysis of the GSK-3 phosphoproteome and strong evidence that GSK-3 broadly regulates alternative splicing.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SILAC', '*Wnt signaling', '*alternative splicing', '*embryonic stem cell', '*glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)', '*leukemia', '*lithium', '*phosphoproteomics', '*spliceosome']",PMC5672046,"['R01 AG046544/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH100923/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL110806/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008076/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA196539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM115517/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM118048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI118891/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM110174/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 15.,"Efforts to improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies and immune checkpoint therapies in myelogenous leukemia are desired. In this study, we evaluated the antileukemia activity of adoptively transferred polyclonal cancer antigen-reactive T cells deficient in the regulator diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKzeta) with or without PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. In the C1498 mouse model of myeloid leukemia, we showed that leukemia was eradicated more effectively in DGKzeta-deficient (DGKzeta(-/-)) mice than wild-type mice. T cells transferred from DGKzeta-deficient mice to wild-type tumor-bearing recipients conferred this benefit. Leukemia clearance was similar to mice treated with anti-PD-L1. Strikingly, we found that the activity of adoptively transferred DGKzeta(-/-) T cells relied partly on induction of sustainable host T-cell immunity. Transferring DGKzeta-deficient T cells increased the levels of IFNgamma and other cytokines in recipient mice, especially with coadministration of anti-PD-L1. Overall, our results offered evidence that targeting DGKzeta may leverage the efficacy of adoptive T-cell and immune checkpoint therapies in leukemia treatment. Furthermore, they suggest that DGKzeta targeting might decrease risks of antigen escape or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Cancer Res; 77(20); 5676-86.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"Myeloid leukemia factor (MLF) plays an important role in development, cell cycle, myeloid differentiation, and regulates the RUNX transcription factors. However, the function of MLF in immunity is still unclear. In this study, an MLF was identified and characterized in kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus, and named as MjMLF. The full-length cDNA of MjMLF contained 1111 nucleotides, which had an opening reading frame of 816 bp encoding a protein of 272 amino acids with an MLF1-interacting protein domain. MjMLF could be ubiquitously detected in different tissues of shrimp at the transcriptional level. The expression pattern analysis showed that MjMLF could be upregulated in shrimp hemocytes and hepatopancreas after white spot syndrome virus challenge. The RNA interference and protein injection assay showed that MjMLF could inhibit WSSV replication in vivo. Flow cytometry assay showed that MjMLF could induce hemocytes apoptosis which functioned in the shrimp antiviral reaction. All the results suggested that MjMLF played an important role in the antiviral immune reaction of kuruma shrimp. The research indicated that MjMLF might function as a novel regulator to inhibit WSSV replication in shrimp.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 13.,"Ultraconserved regions (UCRs) represent a relatively new class of non-coding genomic sequences highly conserved between human, rat and mouse genomes. These regions can reside within exons of protein-coding genes, despite the vast majority of them localizes within introns or intergenic regions. Several studies have undoubtedly demonstrated that most of these regions are actively transcribed in normal cells/tissues, where they contribute to regulate many cellular processes. Interestingly, these non-coding RNAs exhibit aberrant expression levels in human cancer cells and their expression profiles have been used as prognostic factors in human malignancies, as well as to unambiguously distinguish among distinct cancer types. In this review, we first describe their identification, then we provide some updated information about their genomic localization and classification. More importantly, we discuss about the available literature describing an overview of the mechanisms through which some transcribed UCRs (T-UCR) contribute to cancer progression or to the metastatic spread. To date, the interplay between T-UCRs and microRNAs is the most convincing evidence linking T-UCRs and tumorigenesis. The limitations of these studies and the future challenges to be addressed in order to understand the biological role of T-UCRs are also discussed herein. We envision that future efforts are needed to convincingly include this class of ncRNAs in the growing area of cancer therapeutics.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"J subgroup avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) is an exogenous retrovirus of avian. A key feature of ALV-J infection is leading to severe immunosuppressive characteristic of diseases. Viral components of retrovirus were reported closely associated with immunosuppression, and several similarities between exosomes and retrovirus preparations have lead to the hypotheses of retrovirus hijacker exosomes pathway. In this study, we purified exosomes from DF-1 cells infected and uninfected by ALV-J. Electron microscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that ALV-J not only increased the production of exosomes from ALV-J infected DF-1 cells (Exo-J) but also stimulated some proteins expression, especially ALV-J components secreted in exosomes. Immunosuppressive domain peptide (ISD) of envelope subunit transmembrane (TM) and gag of ALV-J were secreted in Exo-J. It has been reported that HIV gag was budded from endosome-like domains of the T cell plasma membrane. But env protein was first detected in exosomes from retrovirus infected cells. We found that Exo-J caused negative effects on splenocytes in a dose-dependant manner by flow cytometric analysis. And low dose of Exo-J activated immune activity of splenocytes, while high dose possessed immunosuppressive properties. Interestingly, Exo-J has no significant effects on the immunosuppression induced by ALV-J, and the immunosuppressive effects induced by Exo-J lower than that by ALV-J. Taken together, our data indicated that Exo-J supplied a microenvironment for the replication and transformation of ALV-J.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"OBJECTIVE: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), but it has also been associated with different hematologic malignancies, including plasmablastic lymphoma, Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and various atypical lymphoproliferative disorders. Patients with underlying lymphoproliferative diseases and chronic blood disorders who become infected with this virus are at risk for human malignancies. This small study reported the frequency of human herpesvirus 8 in 81 Iranian patients with lymphoproliferative disorders for estimation of possible factors affecting malignancy. METHODS: The laboratory records of 81 patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)samples, which were tested for detection of HHV-8 open reading frame (ORF) 26 DNA by nested PCR amplification during the period from Sept. 2014 to Sept. 2015, were reviewed retrospectively at the Firouzgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran. RESULTS: Of 81 subjects, 28 were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 19 were Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 20 were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 11 were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 2 were multiple myeloma (MM). HHV-8 was detected in 16 (19.8%) of the 81 patients. Five out of the sixteen positive patients had CLL followed by 4 NHL, 4 HL and 3ALL. CONCLUSION: We conclude that HHV-8 can be considered as one of the predisposing factors of malignancy in patients with lymphoproliferative and chronic blood disorders. Furthermore, it does not rule out the possibility that other immunological triggers and environmental risk factors may account for their etiopathogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"BACKGROUND: The combined use of genetic markers and detectable minimal residual disease identifies patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with poor outcome after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance therapy in these high-risk patients. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (CLLM1; CLL Maintenance 1 of the German CLL Study Group), patients older than 18 years and diagnosed with immunophenotypically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with active disease, who responded to chemoimmunotherapy 2-5 months after completion of first-line therapy and who were assessed as having a high risk for an early progression with at least a partial response after four or more cycles of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, were eligible if they had high minimal residual disease levels or intermediate levels combined with an unmutated IGHV gene status or TP53 alterations. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lenalidomide (5 mg) or placebo. Randomisation was done with a fixed block size of three, and was stratified according to the minimal residual disease level achieved after first-line therapy. Maintenance was started with 5 mg daily, and was escalated to the target dose of 15 mg. If tolerated, medication was administered until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to an independent review. The pre-planned interim analysis done by intention to treat was done after 20% of the calculated progression-free survival events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01556776; treatment in the lenalidomide group is still ongoing. FINDINGS: Between July 5, 2012, and March 15, 2016, 468 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were screened for the study; 379 (81%) were not eligible. Recruitment was closed prematurely due to poor accrual after 89 of 200 planned patients were randomly assigned: 60 (67%) enrolled patients were assigned to the lenalidomide group and 29 (33%) to the placebo group, of whom 56 (63%) received lenalidomide and 29 (33%) placebo, with a median of 11.0 (IQR 4.5-20.5) treatment cycles at data cutoff. After a median observation time of 17.9 months (IQR 9.1-28.1), the hazard ratio for progression-free survival assessed by an independent review was 0.168 (95% CI 0.074-0.379). Median progression-free survival was 13.3 months (95% CI 9.9-19.7) in the placebo group and not reached (95% CI 32.3-not evaluable) in the lenalidomide group. The most frequent adverse events were skin disorders (35 patients [63%] in the lenalidomide group vs eight patients [28%] in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (34 [61%] vs eight [28%]), infections (30 [54%] vs 19 [66%]), haematological toxicity (28 [50%] vs five [17%]), and general disorders (28 [50%] vs nine [31%]). One fatal adverse event was reported in each of the treatment groups (one [2%] patient with fatal acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the lenalidomide group and one patient (3%) with fatal multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Lenalidomide is an efficacious maintenance therapy reducing the relative risk of progression in first-line patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who do not achieve minimal residual disease negative disease state following chemoimmunotherapy approaches. The toxicity seems to be acceptable considering the poor prognosis of the eligible patients. The trial independently confirms the clinical significance of a novel, minimal residual disease-based algorithm to predict short progression-free survival, which might be incorporated in future clinical trials to identify candidates for additional maintenance treatment.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its natural ligand CXCL12 are key factors in the process of cell migration, homing of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow, and represent important mediators of angiogenesis and cell proliferation. The CXCR4/CXCL12 interplay can be disrupted by CXCR4 antagonists such as Plerixafor which are already in daily clinical use, i.e. for mobilization and subsequent harvesting of hematopoietic progenitor cells and stem cell transplantation. In a pathological condition, involvement in the process of metastasis and homing of cancer cells to a protective niche has been described, making CXCR4 an attractive target for imaging and treatment of malignant diseases. Recently, radiolabeled analogs of CXCR4 antagonists (e.g., [(68)Ga]Pentixafor) have been introduced which can be used for non-invasive imaging of CXCR4 expression in animal models and humans using positron emission tomography. In addition, beta emitter-labeled antagonists (i.e., [(177)Lu]/[(90)Y]Pentixather) have been used in small patient cohorts for treatment of hematological neoplasms such as lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. This review reports on current imaging protocols for CXCR4-directed positron emission tomography in preclinical models and in humans. Furthermore, a theranostic approach using beta emitter-labeled antagonists is highlighted. Molecular imaging of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis can contribute to further understand the process of metastatic spread and the intra-/interindividual heterogeneity of tumors. In addition, CXCR4 directed imaging allows tracking of activated, CXCR4(+) immune cells. This allows for watching inflammatory processes, thus contributing to enlighten the role of the immune system in a variety of cardiovascular and neurological diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Based on existing evidence, we hypothesized that foreign aid for child health would not be proportional to burden of disease. METHODS: In order to examine CHA and burden of disease, we obtained estimates of these parameters from established sources. Estimates of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in children (0-5 years) were obtained from the World Health Organization for 2000 and 2012. The 10 most burdensome disease categories in each continent, excluding high-income countries, were identified for study. Descriptions of all foreign aid commitments between 1996 and 2009 were obtained from AidData, and an algorithm to designate the target diseases of the commitments was constructed. Data were examined in scatterplots for trends. RESULTS: The most burdensome childhood diseases varied by continent. In all continents, newborn diseases, vaccine-preventable diseases (lower respiratory diseases, measles, meningitis, tetanus, and pertussis), and diarrheal diseases ranked within the four most burdensome diseases. Infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV were also among the ten most burdensome diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, and non-communicable diseases were associated with much of the burden in the other continents. CHA grew from $7.4 billion in 1996 to $17.7 billion in 2009 for our study diseases. Diarrheal diseases and malnutrition received the most CHA as well as the most CHA per DALY. CHA directed at HIV increased dramatically over our study period, from $227,000 in 1996 to $3.4 billion in 2008. Little aid was directed at injuries such as drowning, car accidents, and fires, as well as complex medical diseases such as leukemia and endocrine disorders. CONCLUSION: CHA has grown significantly over the last two decades. There is no clear relationship between CHA and burden of disease. This report provides a description of foreign aid for child health, and hopes to inform policy and decision-making regarding foreign aid.",,,,PMC5602827,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray analysis of the cultured cells revealed a two-stage pattern of programmed differentiation during NK cell development. Different transcription factors were enriched during these two stages, suggesting that preparation of progenitors committed to the NK cell lineage occurs in program 1, while NK cell transformation and maturation occur in program 2. Cultured NK cells highly expressed signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors (SFRs), while leukemia cells expressed SFR ligands. The engagement of these SFRs strengthened the cytotoxicity of NK cells toward leukemia cells. These results demonstrate a simple method of obtaining sufficient NK cells for clinical application, and have categorized NK cell differentiation according to commitment and transformation programs. Moreover, the binding between SFRs on NK cells and their ligands on leukemia cells suggests a new basis for NK cell therapy for treatment of leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['SLAM family receptors and ligands', 'leukemia', 'natural killer cell', 'programmed differentiation', 'therapeutic predictor']",PMC5593622,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All authors have no conflicting interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this oncoprotein is considered to be a pertinent and promising target for treating t(8;21) leukemia. Previously, we have shown that downregulation of RUNX1-ETO leads to activation of intracellular signaling pathways enhancing cell survival and determined that the protein ERK2 can mediate activation of most of these pathways. Here we used a combination of oridonin (natural tetracycline diterpenoid), which has been shown to exhibit anti-RUNX1-ETO activity, and ERK2 kinase inhibitors. We found that treatment of leukemic t(8;21)-positive Kasumi-1 cells with oridonin cause decrease of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Treatment of these cells with ERK2 inhibitors makes them more sensitive to RUNX1-ETO inhibition with oridonin.

In primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, ATR signaling is considered to be switched off due to ATR downregulation. Here, we hypothesized that ATR, though expressed at low protein level, could play a role in primary resting CLL cells after genotoxic stress. By investigating the response of CLL cells to UV-C irradiation, a prototypical activator of ATR, we could detect phosphorylation of ATR at Thr-1989, a marker for ATR activation, and also observed that selective ATR inhibitors markedly decreased UV-C-induced phosphorylation of ATR targets, including H2AX and p53. Similar results were obtained with the purine analogs fludarabine and cladribine that were also shown to activate ATR and induce ATR-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX and p53. In addition, ATR inhibition was found to sensitize primary CLL cells to UV-C by decreasing DNA repair synthesis.

Bcl-3 has been shown to be widely expressed in different cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its influence on hepatocarcinogenesis is still undetermined. To examine the role of Bcl-3 in hepatocarcinogenesis mice with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 (Bcl-3(Hep)) were exposed to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and phenobarbital (PB). Hepatic Bcl-3 overexpression attenuated DEN/PB-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Bcl-3(Hep) mice exhibited a lower number and smaller tumor nodules in response to DEN/PB at 40 weeks of age. Reduced HCC formation was accompanied by a lower rate of cell proliferation and a distinct expression pattern of growth and differentiation-related genes. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and especially extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) was reduced in tumor and tumor-surrounding liver tissue of Bcl-3(Hep) mice, while p38 and NF-kappaB p65 were phosphorylated to a higher extent compared to the wild type. In parallel, the absolute number of intrahepatic macrophages, CD8(+) T cells and activated B cells was reduced in DEN/PB-treated Bcl-3(Hep) mice mirroring a reduction of tumor-associated inflammation. Interestingly, at the early time point of 7 weeks following tumor initiation, a higher rate of apoptotic cell death was observed in Bcl-3(Hep) mice. In summary, hepatocyte-restricted Bcl-3 overexpression reduced hepatocarcinogenesis related to prolonged liver injury early after tumor initiation likely due to decreased survival of DEN/PB-damaged, premalignant cells. Therefore, Bcl-3 could become a novel player in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic tools for HCC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell leukemia-3 (Bcl-3)', 'apoptosis', 'hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)', 'nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)']",PMC5593547,,['CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS All authors declare no conflicting interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) and clinical outcomes in the setting of haplo-SCT. Between May 2012 and March 2014, 345 patients who underwent unmanipulated haplo-SCT were retrospectively enrolled. PTR occurred in 20.6% of all patients. Patients in the PTR group experienced higher transplant-related mortality (TRM, 43.7% vs. 13.5%, P<0.001), lower overall survival (OS, 47.9% vs. 76.3%, P<0.001) and lower leukemia-free survival (LFS, 47.9% vs. 72.3%, P<0.001) compared to patients in the non-PTR group. The multivariate analysis showed that PTR was associated with TRM (P=0.002), LFS (P<0.001), and OS (P<0.001). The cumulative incidences of PTR in patients receiving >12 platelet (PLT) transfusions (third quartile of PLT transfusions) were higher than in patients receiving either >6 (second quartile) or >3 (first quartile) PLT transfusions (56.1% vs. 41.6% vs. 28.2%, respectively; P<0.001). The multivariate analysis also showed that PTR was associated with the number of PLT transfusions (P<0.001).

Epub 2017 Sep 15.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD AML) accounts for 20-30% of AML cases. This subtype usually responds poorly to conventional therapies, and might become resistant to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) due to molecular bypass mechanisms. New therapeutic strategies focusing on resistance mechanisms are therefore urgently needed. Pim kinases are FLT3-ITD oncogenic targets that have been implicated in FLT3 TKI resistance. However, their precise biological function downstream of FLT3-ITD requires further investigation. We performed high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in Pim2-depleted FLT3-ITD AML cells and found that Pim2 predominantly controlled apoptosis through Bax expression and mitochondria disruption. We identified ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3 (RSK2), a 90 kDa serine/threonine kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade encoded by the RPS6KA3 gene, as a novel Pim2 target. Ectopic expression of an RPS6KA3 allele rescued the viability of Pim2-depleted cells, supporting the involvement of RSK2 in AML cell survival downstream of Pim2.

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL patients aged between 25 and 64 years of age were enrolled. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to receive therapy containing Hd-MTX (3 g/m(2)) or Id-MTX (0.5 g/m(2)). A total of 360 patients were enrolled. The CR rate was 86%. A total of 115 and 114 patients were assigned to the Hd-MTX and Id-MTX groups, respectively. The estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate of the Hd-MTX group was 58%, which was significantly better than that of the Id-MTX group at 32% (P=0.0218). The frequencies of severe adverse events were not significantly different. We herein demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of Hd-MTX therapy for adult Ph-negative ALL.

It was particularly intensified by the detection of three leukaemia clusters near nuclear installations, i.e. near the reprocessing plants in Sellafield and Dounreay, UK, and near the Krummel nuclear power plant, Germany, the last of which commenced between 1990 and 1991 and was first described in 1992; it continued until 2003, and an elevated risk up to 2005 has been reported in the literature. A number of expert commissions and working groups were set up by the governments of the German federal states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein to investigate the possible causes of the cluster. An overview of the many risk factors that were investigated as a possible explanation of the Krummel cluster is given here, focussing on radiation, but also including other risk factors. Further, results from related epidemiological and cytogenetic studies are described. In summary, the cause of the occurrence of the Krummel cluster has to be considered as unknown. Further research on the causes of childhood leukaemia is needed, focussing on epigenetics and on gene-environment interaction. An update of the leukaemia incidence around the Krummel site shows that the incidence rates are now comparable to the average rate in Germany.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Jan 2.,"Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which exhibit stem cell-like features and are responsible for tumor relapse, metastasis, and chemoresistance. The development of effective treatments for HCC will depend on a molecular-level understanding of the specific pathways driving CSC emergence and stemness. MacroH2A1 is a variant of the histone H2A and an epigenetic regulator of stem-cell function, where it promotes differentiation and, conversely, acts as a barrier to somatic-cell reprogramming. Here, we focused on the role played by the histone variant macroH2A1 as a potential epigenetic factor promoting CSC differentiation. In human HCC sections we uncovered a significant correlation between low frequencies of macroH2A1 staining and advanced, aggressive HCC subtypes with poorly differentiated tumor phenotypes. Using HCC cell lines, we found that short hairpin RNA-mediated macroH2A1 knockdown induces acquisition of CSC-like features, including the growth of significantly larger and less differentiated tumors when injected into nude mice. MacroH2A1-depleted HCC cells also exhibited reduced proliferation, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and stem-like metabolic changes consistent with enhanced hypoxic responses and increased glycolysis. The loss of macroH2A1 increased expression of a panel of stemness-associated genes and drove hyperactivation of the nuclear factor kappa B p65 pathway. Blocking phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 on Ser536 inhibited the emergence of CSC-like features in HCC cells knocked down for macroH2A1. Conclusion: The absence of histone variant macroH2A1 confers a CSC-like phenotype to HCC cells in vitro and in vivo that depends on Ser536 phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B p65; this pathway may hold valuable targets for the development of CSC-focused treatments for HCC.

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,"INTRODUCTION: SETBP1 mutations have been established as a diagnostic marker in myeloid malignancies and are associated with inferior survival. Since there is limited data on their clinical impact and stability during disease progression, we sought to investigate the relationship between SETBP1 mutations and disease evolution. METHODS: Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of the SETBP1 gene was performed for 442 unselected patients with World Health Organization (WHO) defined myeloid disorders. Follow-up analysis was performed on samples from 123/442 patients to investigate SETBP1 mutation dynamics. Targeted deep next-generation sequencing for a panel of 30 leukemia-associated genes was established to study SETBP1 cooperating mutations. RESULTS: 10/442 patients (2.3%) had SETBP1 hotspot mutations (MDS/MPN, n = 7, sAML, n = 3), whereas four patients (1%) had SETBP1 non-hotspot mutations (MPN, n = 1; MDS, n = 2; sAML, n = 1). The median overall survival for patients with SETBP1 hotspot mutations, SETBP1 non-hotspot mutations, and SETBP1 wild type was 14 (range 0-31), 50 (range 0-71), and 47 months (range 0-402), respectively. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, SETBP1 hotspot mutations were significantly associated with reduced overall survival compared to SETBP1 non-hotspot mutations and the SETBP1 wild type (p < 0.001). All 10 patients with SETBP1 hotspot mutations died from relapse or disease progression. Three of four patients with SETBP1 non-hotspot mutations are alive with stable disease. Cooperating CSF3R and TET2 mutations were most frequently observed in patients with SETBP1 hotspot mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SETBP1 hotspot mutations suffered from aggressive disease with rapid evolution and inferior overall survival. Patients with SETBP1 non-hotspot mutations had less aggressive disease and a more favorable prognosis. Diagnostic screens for SETBP1 hotspot mutations may help identifying this dismal patient group and treat them in multicenter clinical studies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia-associated genes', 'MDS/MPN', 'Myeloid malignancies', 'SETBP1 hotspot mutations', 'sAML']",,"['J43/This study was funded by the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research', '(Universitatsklinikum Jena, Germany) with the Junior project grant No. J43.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 3.,"Previous studies have suggested that vitamin B6 is an ergogenic factor. However, the role of dietary vitamin B6 in skeletal muscle has not been widely researched. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary vitamin B6 on the gene expression of 19 myokines, 14 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated factors, 8 myogenesis-related factors and 4 heat shock proteins (HSPs), which may serve important roles in skeletal muscles. Rats were fed a diet containing 1 (marginal vitamin B6 deficiency), 7 (recommended dietary level) or 35 mg/kg of pyridoxine (PN) HCl/ for 6 weeks. Gene expressions were subsequently analysed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Food intake and growth were unaffected by this dietary treatment. The rats in the 7 and 35 mg/kg PN HCl groups exhibited a significant increase in the concentration of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in the gastrocnemius muscle compared with the 1 mg/kg PN HCl diet (P<0.01). The expressions of myokines, such as IL-7, IL-8, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, IL-6, growth differentiation factor 11, myonectin, leukaemia inhibitory factor, apelin and retinoic acid receptor responder (tazarotene induced) 1, the expression of Nrf2 and its regulated factors, such as heme oxygenase 1, superoxide dismutase 2, glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione S-transferase, and the expression of myogenin and HSP60 were significantly elevated in the 7 mg/kg PN HCl group compared with the 1 mg/kg PN HCl diet (P<0.05). No significant differences in levels of these genes were observed between the 35 and 1 mg/kg PN HCl, with the exception of GDF11 and myonectin, whose expressions were significantly increased in the 35 mg/kg PN HCl (P<0.05). Notably, the majority of gene expressions that were affected responded to dietary supplemental vitamin B6 in a similar manner. The results suggest that compared with the marginal vitamin B6 deficiency, the recommended dietary intake of vitamin B6 upregulates the gene expression of a number of factors that promote the growth and repair of skeletal muscle.",,['NOTNLM'],"['gastrocnemius muscle', 'heat shock protein 60', 'myogenin', 'myokine', 'nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2', 'rats', 'vitamin B6']",PMC5585884,,,,,,,,,,,,

THP-1 cells were exposed to different concentrations of COR for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h. The cell viability and apoptotic rate were analyzed. The gene expression of Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were assessed by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of phosphorylated (p)-Akt, p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cleaved caspase-3. It was found that the viability of THP-1 cells was inhibited by COR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment with 200 microM COR for 24 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased. COR also downregulated the levels of Bcl-2, Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, and elevated the expression of Bax. The protein levels of p-Akt and p-ERK were suppressed and cleaved caspase-3 was increased after treatment of COR. In conclusion, COR was found to induce apoptosis of THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells through downregulation of ERK/Akt signaling.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'ERK', 'THP-1', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'cordycepin']",PMC5585717,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS) is considered a disease with distinct clinical and biological features. There are few studies focusing on the clonal cytogenetic changes during evolution of ML-DS. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a complex karyotype involving a previously unreported set of chromosomal abnormalities acquired during progression of ML-DS in an infant boy: derivative der(1)t(1;15)(q24;q23), translocation t(4;5)(q26;q33) and derivative der(15)t(7;15)(p21;q23). Different molecular cytogenetic probes and probesets including whole chromosome painting (WCP) and locus specific probes, as well as, multicolor-FISH and multicolor chromosome banding (MCB) were performed in order to characterize the chromosomal abnormalities involved in this complex karyotype. The patient was treated according to the acute myeloid leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich-2004 (AML-BFM 2004) treatment protocol for patients with Down syndrome; however, he experienced a poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The molecular cytogenetic studies performed, allowed the characterization of novel chromosomal abnormalities in ML-DS and possible candidate genes involved in the leukemogenic process. Our findings suggest that the complex karyotype described here was associated with the poor prognosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Complex karyotype', 'Down syndrome', 'Molecular cytogenetic', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'Unreported chromosomal abnormalities']",PMC5594429,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly CD5 was also expressed on these in vitro generated ILCs. This was not an in vitro artifact because CD5 was also found on ex vivo isolated ILCs from thymus and from umbilical cord blood. CD5 was also expressed on small proportions of ILC2 and ILC3. CD5(+) ILCs were functionally immature, but could further differentiate into mature CD5(-) cytokine-secreting ILCs.

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,"Nearly one-third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia have FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 mutations and thus have poor survival prospects. Receptor tyrosine kinase anexelekto is critical for FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 signaling and participates in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitor resistance mechanisms. Thus, strategies targeting anexelekto could prove useful for acute myeloid leukemia therapy. ONO-7475 is an inhibitor with high specificity for anexelekto and MER tyrosine kinase. Herein, we report that ONO-7475 potently arrested growth and induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia with internal tandem duplication mutation of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3. MER tyrosine kinase-lacking MOLM13 cells were sensitive to ONO-7475, while MER tyrosine kinase expressing OCI-AML3 cells were resistant, suggesting that the drug acts via anexelekto in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Reverse phase protein analysis of ONO-7475 treated cells revealed that cell cycle regulators like cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin B1, polo-like kinase 1, and retinoblastoma were suppressed. ONO-7475 suppressed cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin B1, polo-like kinase 1 gene expression suggesting that anexelekto may regulate the cell cycle, at least in part, via transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, ONO-7475 was effective in a human FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication mutant murine xenograft model. Mice fed a diet containing ONO-7475 exhibited significantly longer survival and, interestingly, blocked leukemia cell infiltration in the liver. In summary, ONO-7475 effectively kills acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo by mechanisms that involve disruption of diverse survival and proliferation pathways.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5709104,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,"Transcriptional deregulation caused by epigenetic or genetic alterations is a major cause of leukemic transformation. The Spi1/PU.1 transcription factor is a key regulator of many steps of hematopoiesis, and limits self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. The deregulation of its expression or activity contributes to leukemia, in which Spi1 can be either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. Herein we explored whether cellular senescence, an anti-tumoral pathway that restrains cell proliferation, is a mechanism by which Spi1 limits hematopoietic cell expansion, and thus prevents the development of leukemia. We show that Spi1 overexpression triggers cellular senescence both in primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. Erythroid and myeloid lineages are both prone to Spi1-induced senescence. In hematopoietic cells, Spi1-induced senescence requires its DNA-binding activity and a functional p38MAPK14 pathway but is independent of a DNA-damage response. In contrast, in fibroblasts, Spi1-induced senescence is triggered by a DNA-damage response. Importantly, using our well-established Spi1 transgenic leukemia mouse model, we demonstrate that Spi1 overexpression also induces senescence in erythroid progenitors of the bone marrow in vivo before the onset of the pre-leukemic phase of erythroleukemia. Remarkably, the senescence response is lost during the progression of the disease and erythroid blasts do not display a higher expression of Dec1 and CDKN1A, two of the induced senescence markers in young animals. These results bring indirect evidence that leukemia develops from cells which have bypassed Spi1-induced senescence. Overall, our results reveal senescence as a Spi1-induced anti-proliferative mechanism that may be a safeguard against the development of acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5664389,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of these interventions on the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms, progression-free survival and overall survival is reported in the meta-analysis herein, based on individual patient data from 9498 patients treated within 16 randomized controlled trials for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma between 1984 and 2007. Secondary malignant neoplasms were meta-analyzed using Peto's method as time-to-event outcomes. For progression-free and overall survival, hazard ratios derived from each trial using Cox regression were combined by inverse-variance weighting. Five study questions (combined-modality treatment vs. chemotherapy alone; more extended vs. involved-field radiotherapy; radiation at higher doses vs. radiation at 20 Gy; more vs. fewer cycles of the same chemotherapy protocol; standard-dose chemotherapy vs. intensified chemotherapy) were investigated. After a median follow-up of 7.4 years, dose-intensified chemotherapy resulted in better progression-free survival rates (P=0.007) as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, but was associated with an increased risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (P=0.0028). No progression-free or overall survival differences were observed between combined-modality treatment and chemotherapy alone, but more secondary malignant neoplasms were seen after combined-modality treatment (P=0.010). For the remaining three study questions, outcomes and secondary malignancy rates did not differ significantly between treatment strategies. The results of this meta-analysis help to weigh up efficacy and secondary malignancy risk for the choice of first-line treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma patients.

The molecular biology of MLL fusion genes remains incompletely characterized and is complicated by the fact that more than 100 different partner genes have been identified in fusions with MLL. The continuously growing list of MLL fusions also represents a clinical challenge with respect to identification of novel fusions and tracking of the fusions to monitor progression of the disease after treatment. Recently, we have developed a novel single-donor model leukemia system that permits the development of human AML from normal cord blood cells. Gene expression analysis of this model and of MLL-AML patient samples has identified a number of candidate biomarker genes with highly biased expression on leukemic cells. Here, we present data demonstrating the potential clinical utility of several of these candidate genes for identifying known and novel MLL fusions.","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2014 Feb 18.,"Baicalein and pentamethyl-hydroxychromane (PMC) have been investigated for use as antioxidants. However, antioxidants may stimulate free radical formation under certain conditions. The aim of our study was to determine whether PMC and baicalein exhibit both pro-oxidant and antioxidant activities in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. In this study, electron spin resonance spectrometry was used to investigate the effects of baicalein and PMC on free radical formation. In HL-60 cells, baicalein and PMC produced hydroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, respectively, but each inhibited radical formation by the other. The PMC pro-oxidant activity required H2O2, whereas baicalein produced hydroxyl radicals during the cell resting state only. The antioxidant effect of baicalein on PMC-induced oxidative stress in HL-60 cells may involve myeloperoxidase inhibition, which produces the myeloperoxidase-protein radical. Our investigation of the antioxidant effects of baicalein on arachidonic acid (AA)-induced oxidative stress in HL-60 cells showed that the baicalein-phenoxyl radical was the primary product, and that either carbon-centered or acyl radicals were the secondary products. However, the antioxidant effects of PMC on AA-induced oxidative stress produced only nonradical products. In conclusion, we showed that baicalein displayed both pro-oxidant and antioxidant activities in HL-60 cells. PMC exhibited no pro-oxidant activity during the cells' resting state but produced the PMC-phenoxyl radical in the presence of H2O2.The reaction of baicalein with AA in HL-60 cells produced baicalein-derived phenoxyl radicals that may initiate various pro-oxidative reactions.

Epub 2017 Oct 16.,"Embryonic stem cells typically show properties of long-term self-renewal and lack of differentiation. When appropriately stimulated, they are able to differentiate into all cell lineages, and lose their self-renewal characteristics. These properties are controlled by a series of genes encoding several transcription factors, including OCT4, the product of POU5F1 gene. OCT4 is expressed in germ cell tumors but also aberrantly in cancers developing in differentiated tissues. In a previous study, we observed a high expression of OCT4 in acute myeloid cell lines and primary cells, regardless of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtype. In this study, we investigated the putative oncogenic role of OCT4 in proliferation and differentiation arrest. OCT4 expression was assessed in a panel of myeloid cell lines, together with clonogenic and proliferation properties, before and after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). Same experiments were performed under short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated OCT4 inhibition. In the presence of RA, we observed a decrease of OCT4 expression, associated with a loss of clonogenic and proliferation capacities, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of p21, in HL60, NB4, KASUMI, and Me-1 cell lines. This effect was absent in the KG1a cell line, which did not differentiate. Downregulation of OCT4 by shRNA resulted in the same pattern of differentiation and loss of proliferation. Although KG1a did not differentiate, a decrease in proliferation was observed. Our findings suggest that OCT4 is implicated in the differentiation arrest at least in some types of AML, and that it also plays a role in cell proliferation through different oncogenic mechanisms. OCT4 might be a potential new target for antileukemic treatments.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*OCT4', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*clonogenic capacity', '*differentiation', '*proliferation', '*shRNA inhibition']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 111 pairs of newly diagnosed cALL patients and patients with fractures were collected from Shenzhen Children's Hospital, China, between January 2015 and November 2016. Age and sex of the cases and controls were 1ratio 1 matched and LNA(TM) miRNA microarray was performed using 4 pairs of cALL and controls selected from the sample population. The expression level of miRNA was validated by real time quantitative PCR. Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association between miRNA expression levels and the incidence risk of cALL. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and reclassification analysis were conducted to assess the feasibility of miRNAs serving as biomarkers for cALL. Results: A total of 204 differentially expressed miRNA were screened out and let-7f-5p, miR-5100, miR-25-3p and miR-3654 were selected for validation identified according to the inclusion criteria. The expression levels of let-7f-5p, miR-5100 and miR-25-3p in the cALL patients were significantly lower than those of the controls (P<0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, 3 miRNAs remained significantly associated with the risk of cALL (OR and 95%CI were 0.84 (0.76-0.92), 0.81 (0.73-0.90) and 0.81 (0.74-0.89), respectively. Results from both the ROC analysis and reclassification analysis showed that introduction of one or more miRNA to traditional risk factors improved the area under the curve (P<0.05) and provided additional values to diagnosis (P<0.01). Conclusion: The expression levels of let-7f-5p, miR-5100 and miR-25-3p were significantly associated with the incidence rate of cALL, and these miRNAs might serve as promising biomarkers for cALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a series of 897 adult patients with AML receiving intensive chemotherapy, we identified 41 patients (4.8%) with PTR. PTR was more frequently observed in parous women, patients with extra-medullary disease, a low white blood cell count, an infection, or hemophagocytic syndrome. Among the 31 patients with anti-human leucocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, an HLA-matched donor was identified for 18 patients (58.1%). Median time between diagnosis of PTR and the first HLA-matched transfusion was 12.5days. HLA-matched transfusions induced a significant increment in platelet counts in 37% of cases. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists were given to 10 patients but did not shorten the duration of thrombocytopenia, reduce severe bleeding, or early death. Grade 3-4 bleeding events during induction, early death caused by bleeding, and death caused by bleeding at any time were significantly greater in patients that had platelet transfusion refractoriness (22% vs. 4.1%, P<0.0001; 12.2% vs. 1.4%, P=0.0006; and 24.4% vs. 5.3%, P<0.0001; respectively).

myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unsatisfactory. Recent studies have shown that HLA-mismatched microtransplant could improve outcomes in such patients. Objective: To evaluate outcomes in different age groups among older patients with newly diagnosed AML who receive HLA-mismatched microtransplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter clinical study included 185 patients with de novo AML at 12 centers in China, the United States, and Spain in the Microtransplantation Interest Group. Patients were divided into the following 4 age groups: 60 to 64 years, 65 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, and 75 to 85 years. The study period was May 1, 2006, to July 31, 2015. Exposures: Induction chemotherapy and postremission therapy with cytarabine hydrochloride with or without anthracycline, followed by highly HLA-mismatched related or fully mismatched unrelated donor cell infusion. No graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the complete remission rates, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival in different age groups. Additional end points of the study included hematopoietic recovery, graft-vs-host disease, relapse rate, nonrelapse mortality, and other treatment-related toxicities. Results: Among 185 patients, the median age was 67 years (range, 60-85 years), and 75 (40.5%) were female. The denominators in adjusted percentages in overall survival, leukemia-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality are not the sample proportions of observations. The overall complete remission rate was not significantly different among the 4 age groups (75.4% [52 of 69], 70.2% [33 of 47], 79.1% [34 of 43], and 73.1% [19 of 26). The 1-year overall survival rates were 87.7%, 85.8%, and 77.8% in the first 3 age groups, which were much higher than the rate in the fourth age group (51.7%) (P = .004, P = .008, and P = .04, respectively). The 2-year overall survival rates were 63.7% and 66.8% in the first 2 age groups, which were higher than the rates in the last 2 age groups (34.2% and 14.8%) (P = .02, P = .03, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). The 1-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality were 10.2%, 0%, 3.4%, and 26.0% in the 4 age groups and 8.1% in all patients. The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were 12 days and 14 days after induction chemotherapy, respectively. Five patients had full or mixed donor engraftment, and 30.8% (8 of 26) of patients demonstrated donor microchimerism. Two patients (1.1%) developed severe acute graft-vs-host disease.

Since there are no disease-specific differences among HTLV-1 strains, the etiological mechanisms separating these respective lymphoproliferative and inflammatory diseases are not well understood. In this study, by using IL-2-dependent HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines (ILTs) established from patients with ATL and HAM/TSP, we demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and its downstream signals potentially act as a switch for proliferation in HTLV-1-infected cells. Among six ILTs used, ILTs derived from all three ATL patients grew much faster than those from three HAM/TSP patients. Although most of the ILTs tested produced IFN-gamma and IL-6, the production of IL-10 was preferentially observed in the rapid-growing ILTs. Interestingly, treatment with exogenous IL-10 markedly enhanced proliferation of the slow-growing HAM/TSP-derived ILTs. The IL-10-mediated proliferation of these ILTs was associated with phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of survivin and IRF4, all of which are characteristics of ATL cells. Knockdown of STAT3 reduced expression of IL-10, implying a positive-feedback regulation between STAT3 and IL-10. STAT3 knockdown also reduced survivin and IRF4 in the IL-10- producing or IL-10- treated ILTs. IRF4 knockdown further suppressed survivin expression and the cell growth in these ILTs. These findings indicate that the IL-10-mediated signals promote cell proliferation in HTLV-1-infected cells through the STAT3 and IRF4 pathways. Our results imply that, although HTLV-1 infection alone may not be sufficient for cell proliferation, IL-10 and its signaling pathways within the infected cell itself and/or its surrounding microenvironment may play a critical role in pushing HTLV-1-infected cells towards proliferation at the early stages of HTLV-1 leukemogenesis. This study provides useful information for understanding of disease mechanisms and disease-prophylactic strategies in HTLV-1 infection.",,,,PMC5614654,,,,,,,,,,,,

To describe U.S. ALL incidence rates and trends among persons aged <20 years during 2001-2014, CDC analyzed rigorous data (based on established publication criteria) from the United States Cancer Statistics data set, which includes incidence data on approximately 15,000 new cases per year of all types of invasive cancer among children and adolescents aged <20 years (4). The data set represented 98% of the U.S. population during the study period. Overall incidence of pediatric ALL during 2001-2014 was 34.0 cases per 1 million persons and among all racial/ethnic groups was highest among Hispanics (42.9 per 1 million). Both overall and among Hispanics, pediatric ALL incidence increased during 2001-2008 and remained stable during 2008-2014. ALL incidence was higher in the West than in any other U.S. Census region. State-specific data indicated that the highest rates of pediatric ALL incidence were in California, New Mexico, and Vermont. These demographic and geographic ALL incidence data might better inform public health interventions targeting the following areas: exposures to recognized risk factors for leukemia; ALL treatment, including clinical trial enrollment; survivorship care planning; and studies designed to understand the factors affecting changes in pediatric cancer incidence.",,,,PMC5657918,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Cytotoxicity assay (MTT) clearly demonstrated a 22%, 31.7%, and 19.5% decrease in cell proliferation of COLO 205, HeLa, and K562 cells, respectively, when compared to the noncancerous HEK 293T cells. Normal phase-contrast microscopic images clearly suggested that the mechanism of cell death is by apoptosis. To further confirm the induction of apoptosis by Unique IS2, the sub-G0-G1 peak of the cell cycle was quantified using a flow cytometer and the data indicated 40% of the apoptotic cells in Unique IS2-treated COLO cells when compared with their untreated control cells. The Western blot analysis showed an increase in pro-apoptotic protein BAX, decrease in antiapoptotic protein, Bcl2, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in cytochrome c release, increase in Caspase 3 activity, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The present study suggests that the heat-killed culture supernatant of B. coagulans can be more effective in inducing apoptosis of colon cancer cells and that can be considered for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colon carcinoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a systematic review to identify BPDCN cases, to compare pediatric BPDCN cases with adult cases. A total of 125 publications were identified detailing 356 cases. Including 1 pediatric case from our institution, 74 were children, and 283 were adults aged 19 or over. Age was shown to be an independent prognostic factor predictive of more favorable outcomes across measures including initial response to therapy, likelihood of relapse, and overall survival at follow-up. The distribution of affected organs at diagnosis was similar across children and adults and type of clinical presentation did not disproportionately influence 1 age group's prognosis over the other. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type chemotherapy regimens were shown to be superior to other chemotherapy regimens (acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, other, or none) in inducing complete remission.

Insertion of therapeutic genes into the genome of a modified adenovirus, thereby creating a so-called gene-virotherapy that shares the advantages of gene therapy and virotherapy. In this study we investigated whether a strategy that combines the oncolytic effects of an adenoviral vector with the simultaneous expression of the autophagy gene Beclin-1 offered a therapeutic advantage for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells with resistance to chemotherapy and evaluated the synergistic effects of SG511-BECN and doxorubicin (Dox) in human CML cells in vitro. Oncolytic virus SG511-BECN was constructed through introducing the Beclin-1 gene into the oncolytic adenoviral backbone. SG511-BECN displayed significantly improved antileukemia activity on multidrug-resistant CML cell line K562/A02, which was mediated via induction of autophagic cell death. Furthermore, Dox could synergize with SG511-BECN to kill the CML cells by improving the infectious efficiency of the oncolytic adenovirus without causing significant damage to normal human mononuclear cells. The results demonstrate that targeting the autophagic cell death pathway and combination of a chemotherapy agent with oncolytic adenovirus may be a novel strategy for the treatment of leukemia with chemotherapy resistance.",,,,PMC5800462,,,,,,,,,,,,

Japan is the most endemic country for HTLV-1 and ATL in the world. Recent nationwide studies of Japanese blood donors reported that HTLV-1 carriers spread from endemic areas to non-endemic areas. Therefore, the latest information on nationwide epidemiological and clinical data for ATL is necessary to guide clinical practice. We undertook a multicenter, hospital-based survey of newly diagnosed ATL patients from 2010 to 2011. A total of 996 patients with ATL were registered from 126 hospitals across Japan. Of those, 922 (487 men and 435 women) were included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years). Overall, 67.2% of ATL was diagnosed in the Kyushu-Okinawa area. The most common subtype was acute (49.5%), followed by lymphoma (25.7%), chronic (14.2%), and smoldering (10.6%). Lymphoma type was more prevalent in men (60%), whereas chronic was more prevalent in women (60%). Half of patients with lymphoma type were aged over 70 years, whereas one-third of patients with the chronic type were aged under 60 years. All of these characteristics were different from those of the previous nationwide surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. This survey clarified that half of current patients with ATL are aged over 68 years who were unable to receive intensive cytotoxic therapies. New less toxic agents for aged patients and further strategies to prevent the development of ATL from HTLV-1 carrier status are needed.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Mutations in DNMT3A are candidate prognostic and classification markers in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-ALL and thus were considered as candidates prognostic markers in pediatric T-ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNMT3A mutational status was investigated in 74 pediatric T-ALL samples collected at diagnosis. We applied high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis and Sanger sequencing to study the hotspot position (R882) within catalytic MTase domain and exons coding for other functional domains of the protein, known to be mutated in the wide spectrum of hematological malignancies. RESULTS: We demonstrate a low frequency of mutations in DNMT3A coding sequence in pediatric T-ALL (1.4%, n = 1/74). We identified missense mutation, p.Ala644Thr, which has not been described previously in pediatric T-ALL, but is recurrent in adults with T-ALL and AML. CONCLUSIONS: Low frequency of DNMT3A mutations in pediatric T-ALL is in striking contrast to adult T-ALL and renders the necessity for the search of other candidate prognostic markers.

We performed a phase Ib study to investigate the safety and tolerability of 5-Aza (75 mg/m(2)) combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (PAN) in adult Japanese patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Eleven patients were enrolled; five received 20 mg PAN + 5-Aza and six received 30 mg PAN + 5-Aza. All patients in the 20 mg PAN cohort had MDS, while two in the 30 mg PAN cohort had MDS and three had CMML. All patients experienced >/=1 adverse event (AE) related to the study treatment, and five discontinued the study treatment because of AEs. One patient in each group exhibited dose-limiting toxicities: lung infection (PAN 20 mg + 5-Aza) and cellulitis (PAN 30 mg + 5-Aza). PAN exposure increased with ascending doses, and combination therapy did not affect PAN plasma trough concentrations. In summary, 20 or 30 mg PAN combined with 5-Aza was safe and tolerable in adult Japanese patients with CMML or MDS.

The genetic basis of ALL susceptibility has been supported by its association with certain congenital disorders and, more recently, by several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These GWAS identified common variants in ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, LHPP and ELK3 influencing ALL risk. However, the risk variants of these SNPs were not validated in all populations, suggesting that some of the loci could be population specific. On the other hand, the currently identified risk SNPs in these genes only account for 19% of the additive heritable risk. This estimation indicates that additional susceptibility variants could be discovered. In this review, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in genetic susceptibility of childhood ALL in all GWAS and subsequent studies and we will also point to future directions that could be explored in the near future.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Childhood', 'SNP', 'Susceptibility']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 13.,"PURPOSE: The fusion gene BCR-ABL has an important role to the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and several signaling pathways have been characterized as responsible for the terminal blastic phase (BP). However, the initial phase, the chronic phase (CP), is long lasting and there is much yet to be understood about the critical role of BCR-ABL in this phase. This study aims to evaluate transcriptional deregulation in CD34+ hematopoietic cells (CD34+ cells) from patients with untreated newly diagnosed CML compared with CD34+HC from healthy controls. METHODS: Gene expression profiling in CML-CD34 cells and CD34 cells from healthy controls were used for this purpose with emphasis on five main pathways important for enhanced proliferation/survival, enhanced self-renewal and block of myeloid differentiation. RESULTS: We found 835 genes with changed expression levels (fold change >/= +/-2) in CML-CD34 cells compared with CD34 cells. These include genes belonging to PI3K/AKT, WNT/b-catenin, SHH, NOTCH and MAPK signaling pathways. Four of these pathways converge to MYC activation. We also identified five transcripts upregulated in CD34-CML patients named OSBPL9, MEK2, p90RSK, TCF4 and FZD7 that can be potential biomarkers in CD34-CML-CP. CONCLUSION: We show several mRNAs up- or downregulated in CD34-CML during the chronic phase.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CD34+ cells', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic phase', 'Gene expression', 'microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 13.,"A new approach is presented for cell lysate identification which uses SERS-active silver nanoparticles and a droplet-based microfluidic chip. Eighty-nanoliter droplets are generated by injecting silver nanoparticles, KCl as aggregation agent, and cell lysate containing cell constituents, such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates, metabolites, and proteins into a continuous flow of mineral oil. This platform enables accurate mixing of small volumes inside the meandering channels of the quartz chip and allows acquisition of thousands of SERS spectra with 785 nm excitation at an integration time of 1 s. Preparation of three batches of three leukemia cell lines demonstrated the experimental reproducibility. The main advantage of a high number of reproducible spectra is to apply statistics for large sample populations with robust classification results. A support vector machine with leave-one-batch-out cross-validation classified SERS spectra with sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies better than 99% to differentiate Jurkat, THP-1, and MONO-MAC-6 leukemia cell lysates. This approach is compared with previous published reports about Raman spectroscopy for leukemia detection, and an outlook is given for transfer to single cells.

Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the outcome of these patients. KPT-9274 is a novel dual inhibitor of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). PAK4 is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates a variety of fundamental cellular processes. NAMPT is a rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage biosynthesis pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) that plays a vital role in energy metabolism. Here, we show that KPT-9274 strongly inhibits B-ALL cell growth regardless of cytogenetic abnormalities. We also demonstrate the potent in vivo efficacy and tolerability of KPT-9274 in a patient-derived xenograft murine model of B-ALL. Interestingly, although KPT-9274 is a dual PAK4/NAMPT inhibitor, B-ALL cell growth inhibition by KPT-9274 was largely abolished with nicotinic acid supplementation, indicating that the inhibitory effects on B-ALL cells are mainly exerted by NAD(+) depletion through NAMPT inhibition. Moreover, we have found that the extreme susceptibility of B-ALL cells to NAMPT inhibition is related to the reduced cellular NAD(+) reserve. NAD(+) depletion may be a promising alternative approach to treating patients with B-ALL.",,,,,['R01 CA026038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a standard procedure for cholecystolithiasis not only in adults but also in children, and we are aggressively introducing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) at our hospital. We reviewed the patient characteristics, operation procedures and outcomes of 7 children (15 years old and under) with cholecystolithiasis who underwent LC in our hospital between August 1995 and December 2015. The 7 patients included 5 males and 2 females, with a mean age of 8 years 6 months. Underlying diseases were found in 5 patients (cerebral palsy in 2 patients, pancreaticobiliary maljunction with common bile duct stones in 1, acute lymphocytic leukemia in 1, hereditary stomatocytosis in 1), and none were found in the other 2. LC (3 conventional LC and 2 SILC) was performed in 5 of the patients. Laparoscopic choledocholithotomy was performed in 1 patient and laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was performed in 1 patient at the same time. The mean operative time in all the cases of LC was 108 (70-140) minutes (conventional LC 113 (70-140) min, SILC 100 (90-100) min). Intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 4 cases and omitted in 3 cases. The only postoperative complication was a wound infection in 1 patient. The umbilical skin incision length in the SILC was 2.0 cm.

Print 2017 Dec 1.,"Inhibitory receptors have been extensively described for their importance in regulating immune responses in chronic infections and cancers. Blocking the function of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, Tim-3, and LAG-3 has shown promise for augmenting CD8 T cell activity and boosting pathogen-specific immunity. However, the prevalence of inhibitory receptors on CD4 T cells and their relative influence on CD4 T cell functionality in chronic HIV infection remains poorly described. We therefore determined and compared inhibitory receptor expression patterns of 2B4, CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1, and Tim-3 on virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in relation to their functional T cell profile. In chronic HIV infection, inhibitory receptor distribution differed markedly between cytokine-producing T cell subsets with, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-producing cells displaying the highest and lowest prevalence of inhibitory receptors, respectively. Blockade of inhibitory receptors differentially affected cytokine production by cells in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B stimulation. CTLA-4 blockade increased IFN-gamma and CD40L production, while PD-1 blockade strongly augmented IFN-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and TNF-alpha production. In a Friend retrovirus infection model, CTLA-4 blockade in particular was able to improve control of viral replication. Together, these results show that inhibitory receptor distribution on HIV-specific CD4 T cells varies markedly with respect to the functional subset of CD4 T cells being analyzed. Furthermore, the differential effects of receptor blockade suggest novel methods of immune response modulation, which could be important in the context of HIV vaccination or therapeutic strategies.IMPORTANCE Inhibitory receptors are important for limiting damage by the immune system during acute infections. In chronic infections, however, their expression limits immune system responsiveness. Studies have shown that blocking inhibitory receptors augments CD8 T cell functionality in HIV infection, but their influence on CD4 T cells remains unclear. We assessed the expression of inhibitory receptors on HIV-specific CD4 T cells and their relationship with T cell functionality. We uncovered differences in inhibitory receptor expression depending on the CD4 T cell function. We also found differences in functionality of CD4 T cells following blocking of different inhibitory receptors, and we confirmed our results in a Friend virus retroviral model of infection in mice. Our results show that inhibitory receptor expression on CD4 T cells is linked to CD4 T cell functionality and could be sculpted by blockade of specific inhibitory receptors. These data reveal exciting possibilities for the development of novel treatments and immunotherapeutics.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4 T cells', '*CTLA-4', '*HIV', '*PD-1', '*inhibitory receptors']",PMC5686724,"['P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI091450/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI094602/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001069/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2017 Nov 15.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and recognize virus-infected cells as well as tumor cells. Conflicting data about the beneficial or even detrimental role of NK cells in different infectious diseases have been described previously. While the type of pathogen strongly influences NK cell functionality, less is known about how the infection dose influences the quality of a NK cell response against retroviruses. In this study, we used the well-established Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model to investigate the impact of virus dose on the induction of antiviral NK cell functions. High-dose virus inoculation increased initial virus replication compared to that with medium- or low-dose viral challenge and significantly improved NK cell activation. Antiviral NK cell activity, including in vivo cytotoxicity toward infected target cells, was also enhanced by high-dose virus infection. NK cell activation following high-dose viral challenge was likely mediated by activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages and the NK cell-stimulating cytokines interleukin 15 (IL-15) and IL-18. Neutralization of these cytokines decreased NK cell functions and increased viral loads, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity. Here we demonstrate that virus dose positively correlates with antiviral NK cell activity and function, which are at least partly driven by IL-15 and IL-18. Our results suggest that NK cell activity may be therapeutically enhanced by administering IL-15 and IL-18 in virus infections that inadequately activate NK cells.IMPORTANCE In infections with retroviruses, like HIV and FV infection of mice, NK cells clearly mediate antiviral activities, but they are usually not sufficient to prevent severe pathology. Here we show that the initial infection dose impacts the induction of an antiviral NK cell response during an acute retroviral infection, which had not investigated before. High-dose infection resulted in a strong NK cell functionality, whereas no antiviral activities were detected after low- or medium-dose infection. Interestingly, DCs and macrophages were highly activated after high-dose FV challenge, which corresponded with increased levels of NK cell-stimulating cytokines IL-15 and IL-18. IL-15 and IL-18 neutralization decreased NK cell functions, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity. Here we show the importance of cytokines for NK cell activation in retroviral infections; our findings suggest that immunotherapy combining the well-tolerated cytokines IL-15 and IL-18 might be an interesting approach for antiretroviral treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Littwitz-Salomon et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Friend retrovirus', '*antiviral activity', '*interleukins', '*natural killer cells', '*virus dose']",PMC5660477,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), a nationally representative weighted sample of all U.S. hospital discharges, to study outcomes and predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with TLS. The NIS was queried for patients with a discharge diagnosis of TLS (ICD-9 code 277.88) from 2010-2013. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality. From 2010-2013, 28,370 patients were discharged with a diagnosis of TLS. The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (30%), solid tumors (20%), acute myeloid leukemia (19%), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (13%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 21%. The median length of stay was 10 days (IQR 5-22). Sixty-nine percent of patients experienced a severe complication, including sepsis (22%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21-23), dialysis (15%, 95% CI 14-16), acute respiratory failure (23%, 95% CI 22-24), mechanical ventilation (16%, 95% CI 15-17), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6%, 95% CI 5-7), cerebral hemorrhage (2%, 95% CI 2-3), seizures (1%, 95% CI 0.6-1), and cardiac arrest (2%, 95% CI 2-3). Predictors of mortality were derived from a multivariable logistic regression and included age, Elixhauser comorbidity score, insurance status, teaching versus nonteaching hospital, and cancer type. Predictors of increased length of stay included age, race, teaching versus nonteaching hospital, and cancer type.

Epub 2017 Sep 13.,"Patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a poor prognosis. Despite measurable clinical activity with new targeted therapies, many patients do not achieve a complete or durable response suggesting an opportunity to improve upon existing therapies. Here we describe SGN-CD19B, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-based anti-CD19 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being investigated for treatment of B-cell malignancies, which has improved potency compared with other ADCs. CD19-expressing tumor cells rapidly internalize SGN-CD19B, and the released PBD drug induces DNA damage, resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death. SGN-CD19B demonstrated activity against a broad panel of malignant B-cell lines and induced durable regressions in mice bearing xenografts derived from these B-cell malignancies. A single dose of SGN-CD19B induced durable regressions at 300 mug/kg (3 mug/kg drug equivalents); combination with rituximab decreased the curative dose to 100 mug/kg (1 mug/kg drug equivalents). These doses are significantly lower than the level of drug required with other ADC payloads. In cynomolgus monkeys, SGN-CD19B effectively depleted CD20(+) B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues confirming that SGN-CD19B is pharmacodynamically active at well-tolerated doses. In summary, preclinical studies show SGN-CD19B is a highly active ADC, which releases a DNA cross-linking agent rather than a microtubule inhibitor. The distinct mechanism of action, broad potency, and potential to combine with rituximab suggest that SGN-CD19B may offer unique clinical opportunities in B-cell malignancies. A phase 1 clinical trial is in progress to investigate the therapeutic potential of SGN-CD19B in relapsed/refractory B-NHL.

Despite the discovery of specific host receptors, there have been few reports on the modulation of viral susceptibility via genetic modification. We therefore engineered acquired resistance to ALV subgroup B using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology in DF-1 chicken fibroblasts. Using this method, we efficiently modified the tumor virus locus B (tvb) gene, encoding the TVB receptor, which is essential for ALV subgroup B entry into host cells. By expanding individual DF-1 clones, we established that artificially generated premature stop codons in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of TVB receptor confer resistance to ALV subgroup B. Furthermore, we found that a cysteine residue (C80) of CRD2 plays a crucial role in ALV subgroup B entry.

It often follows an indolent course and is preceded by monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, an asymptomatic condition, however it is not known what causes subjects with this condition to progress to CLL. Hence the discovery of prediagnostic markers has the potential to improve the identification of subjects likely to develop CLL and may also provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease of potential clinical relevance. RESULTS: We employed peripheral blood buffy coats of 347 apparently healthy subjects, of whom 28 were diagnosed with CLL 2.0-15.7 years after enrollment, to derive for the first time genome-wide DNA methylation, as well as gene and miRNA expression, profiles associated with the risk of future disease. After adjustment for white blood cell composition, we identified 722 differentially methylated CpG sites and 15 differentially expressed genes (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05) as well as 2 miRNAs (FDR < 0.05) which were associated with the risk of future CLL. The majority of these signals have also been observed in clinical CLL, suggesting the presence in prediagnostic blood of CLL-like cells. Future CLL cases who, at enrollment, had a relatively low B-cell fraction (<10%), and were therefore less likely to have been suffering from undiagnosed CLL or a precursor condition, showed profiles involving smaller numbers of the same differential signals with intensities, after adjusting for B-cell content, generally smaller than those observed in the full set of cases. A similar picture was obtained when the differential profiles of cases with time-to-diagnosis above the overall median period of 7.4 years were compared with those with shorted time-to-disease. Differentially methylated genes of major functional significance include numerous genes that encode for transcription factors, especially members of the homeobox family, while differentially expressed genes include, among others, multiple genes related to WNT signaling as well as the miRNAs miR-150-5p and miR-155-5p. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the presence in prediagnostic blood of future CLL patients, more than 10 years before diagnosis, of CLL-like cells which evolve as preclinical disease progresses, and point to early molecular alterations with a pathogenetic potential.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarkers of risk', 'Epigenomics', 'Molecular epidemiology', 'Prospective cohort', 'Transcriptomics', 'miRNA']",PMC5598006,,,,,,,,['EnviroGenomarkers consortium'],,,"['Gottschalk R', 'van Leeuwen D', 'Timmermans L', 'Botsivali M', 'Bendinelli B', 'Kelly R', 'Portengen L', 'Saberi-Hosnijeh F', 'Hallmans G', 'Lenner P', 'Keun HC', 'Siskos A', 'Athersuch TJ', 'Kogevinas M', 'Stephanou EG', 'Myridakis A', 'Fazzo L', 'De Santis M', 'Comba P', 'Kiviranta H', 'Rantakokko P', 'Airaksinen R', 'Ruokojarvi P', 'Gilthorpe M', 'Fleming S', 'Fleming T', 'Tu YK', 'Jonsson B', 'Lundh T', 'Chen WJ', 'Lee WC', 'Hsiao CK', 'Chien KL', 'Kuo PH', 'Hung H', 'Liao SF']","['Gottschalk, Ralph', 'van Leeuwen, Danitsja', 'Timmermans, Leen', 'Botsivali, Maria', 'Bendinelli, Benedetta', 'Kelly, Rachel', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Saberi-Hosnijeh, Fatemeh', 'Hallmans, Goran', 'Lenner, Per', 'Keun, Hector C', 'Siskos, Alexandros', 'Athersuch, Toby J', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'Stephanou, Euripides G', 'Myridakis, Antonis', 'Fazzo, Lucia', 'De Santis, Marco', 'Comba, Pietro', 'Kiviranta, Hannu', 'Rantakokko, Panu', 'Airaksinen, Riikka', 'Ruokojarvi, Paivi', 'Gilthorpe, Mark', 'Fleming, Sarah', 'Fleming, Thomas', 'Tu, Yu-Kang', 'Jonsson, Bo', 'Lundh, Thomas', 'Chen, Wei J', 'Lee, Wen-Chung', 'Hsiao, Chuhsing Kate', 'Chien, Kuo-Liong', 'Kuo, Po-Hsiu', 'Hung, Hung', 'Liao, Shu-Fen']"

The number of circulating plasma cells is an independent prognostic marker associated with shorter survival, but it can also help to predict early relapse. The reason and mechanism of plasma cell expansion from the bone marrow to enter peripheral blood is still not entirely clear, but possible changes in the expression of adhesion molecules are probably involved. Multiparametric flow cytometry allows simple and exact enumeration of circulating plasma cells in different types of cell suspensions, even in their low quantity. The phenotype profile and confirmation of clonality regarding to their bone marrow clonal counterparts should be verified as well. There is no uniform method used in clinical laboratories for circulating plasma cells analyses at this moment. AIM: Review is focused on use of multiparametric flow cytometry for circulating plasma cells analysis in peripheral blood. It is comparing possibilities of their detection by different methods and on clinical relevance of that assessment. The standardization of analyses is the main goal. CONCLUSION: Multiparametric flow cytometry is a very sensitive method for detection of circulating plasma cells, so using a standardized approach can lead to determination and implementation of the flow cytometry diagnostic threshold in plasma cell leukemia suspicious cases as well as in prognostication of monoclonal gammopathies patients. Moreover, analysis of plasma cells phenotypic profile could probably clarify their future behaviour.Key words: monoclonal gammopathies - circulating plasma cells - plasma cell leukemia - flow cytometry.",,,,,,,,,,Cirkulujici plazmocyty u monoklonalnich gamapatii.,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: Genotyping of NUDT15 was tested in 258 patients with ALL registered at Samsung Medical Center. Patients were classified into normal-activity (wild-type), intermediate-activity (heterozygous variant), and low-activity groups (homozygous or compound heterozygous variant). Clinical and laboratory features during the first year of maintenance therapy were investigated. Results: A total of 182 patients were included in the final analysis. There were five (2.7%), 46 (25.3%), and 131 (72.0%) patients in low-, intermediate-, and normal-activity groups, respectively. The lowest 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dose (mg/m2/day) was administered to the low-activity group (low-activity group 7.5 vs. intermediate-activity group 24.4 vs. normalactivity group 31.1, p &lt; 0.01) from three months to a year after beginning maintenance therapy. The low-activity group experienced the longest duration of therapy interruption during the first year (low-activity group 169 days vs. intermediate-activity group 30 days vs. normal-activity group 16 days, p &lt; 0.01). They also showed the lowest blood cell counts and had a longer duration of leukopenia (low-activity group 131 days vs. intermediate-activity group 92 days vs. normal-activity group 59 days, p &lt; 0.01). 6-TGN level and its ratio to 6-MP dose were lowest in the low-activity group.

Deregulation of any important regulation factors may result in serious consequences including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In order to find out the genes that may take a part in AML development, we analyzed data from AML cDNA microarray (GSE2191) in the NCBI data pool and noticed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is abnormally over-expressed in AML patients. Then we investigated the function and mechanisms of hnRNP A1 in myeloid development. A gradually decreased hnRNP A1 expression was detected during granulocytic differentiation in ATRA-induced-NB4 and HL-60 cells and cytokines-induced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. By function-loss and winning experiments we demonstrated hnRNP A1's inhibition role via inhibiting expression of C/EBPalpha, a key regulator of granulocytic differentiation, in the granulocytic differentiation. During granulocytic differentiation the decrease of hnRNP A1 reduces inhibition on C/EBPalpha expression, and the increased C/EBPalpha promotes the differentiation. We also demonstrated that miR-451 promotes granulocytic differentiation via targeting to and down-regulating hnRNP A1, and hnRNP A1 positively regulates c-Myc expression. Summarily, our results revealed new function and mechanisms of hnRNP A1 in normal granulocytiesis and the involvement of a feed-back loop comprising c-Myc, miR-451 and hnRNP A1 in AML development.",,['NOTNLM'],"['C/EBPalpha', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'granulocytic differentiation', 'hnRNP A1', 'microRNA-451']",PMC5589672,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

identified by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) predicts a worse clinical outcome in CLL patients treated either with standard or new treatments. Herein, we analyzed the clinical impact of complex karyotypes (CK) with or without high-risk FISH deletions (ATM and/or TP53, HR-FISH) in a cohort of 1045 untreated MBL/CLL patients. In all, 99/1045 (9.5%) patients displayed a CK. Despite ATM and TP53 deletions were more common in CK (25% vs 7%; P < 0.001; 40% vs 5%; P < 0.001, respectively), only 44% (40/90) patients with TP53 deletions showed a CK. CK group showed a significant higher two-year cumulative incidence of treatment (48% vs 20%; P < 0.001), as well as a shorter overall survival (OS) (79 mo vs not reached; P < 0.001). When patients were categorized regarding CK and HR-FISH, those with both characteristics showed the worst median OS (52 mo) being clearly distinct from those non-CK and non-HR-FISH (median not reached), but no significant differences were detected between cases with only CK or HR-FISH. Both CK and TP53 deletion remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis for OS. In conclusion, CK group is globally associated with advanced disease and poor prognostic markers. Further investigation in larger cohorts with CK lacking HR-FISH is needed to elucidate which mechanisms underlie the poor outcome of this subgroup.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM deletion', 'CLL', 'TP53 deletion', 'complex karyotype']",PMC5589581,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors made no disclosure of conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

The interface of two apoptotic proteins, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), has been recently affirmed as a target for treating cancers, as the disruption of Mcl-1-PUMA binding can reduce cancer cell survival and protect normal cells from apoptosis. However, therapeutic agents that target this interface are yet to be found. In this work, we combined pharmacophore modelling and biological tests to seek small molecules which target the Mcl-1-PUMA interface. For the first time, a small-molecule compound was identified. Its dual activity has been validated to reduce PUMA-dependent apoptosis while deactivating Mcl-1-mediated anti-apoptosis in cancer cells. Our results would provide a new avenue for the development of effective and safe anti-cancer agents.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1 inhibitor', 'PUMA modulator', 'drug development', 'pharmacophore modelling', 'protein-protein interaction']",PMC5589576,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Despite the importance of SET overexpression and its prognostic impact in both hematologic and solid tumors, little is known about the mechanisms involved in its transcriptional regulation. In this report, we define the minimal promoter region of the SET gene, and identify a novel multi-protein transcription complex, composed of MYC, SP1, RUNX1 and GATA2, which activates SET expression in AML. The role of MYC is crucial, since it increases the expression of the other three transcription factors of the complex, and supports their recruitment to the promoter of SET. These data shed light on a new regulatory mechanism in cancer, in addition to the already known PP2A-MYC and SET-PP2A. Besides, we show that there is a significant positive correlation between the expression of SET and MYC, RUNX1, and GATA2 in AML patients, which further endorses our results. Altogether, this study opens new directions for understanding the mechanisms that lead to SET overexpression, and demonstrates that MYC, SP1, RUNX1 and GATA2 are key transcriptional regulators of SET expression in AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MYC', 'PP2A', 'RUNX1', 'SET']",PMC5589557,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

However, its effectiveness in treating chronic myeloid leukemia [corrected] remains unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of ginkgetin on the growth of the K562 cell line. The MTT assay was employed to examine the proliferation of K562, and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was conducted to detect the apoptotic rates. Furthermore, changes of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected by Western blot analysis. Ginkgetin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Concentrations of ginkgetin required to induce 50% death of K562 at 24, 48 and 72 h were 38.9, 31.3 and 19.2 muM, respectively. Moreover, treatment of ginkgetin increased K562 apoptosis in vitro along with increased levels of TNF-alpha. Interestingly, anti-TNF-alpha antibody prevented ginkgetin-induced K562 cell apoptosis and growth inhibition via deactivation of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3. Concomitantly, downregulation of TNF-alpha by etanercept in vivo attenuated ginkgetin-induced inhibitory effects on the tumor growth in an xenograft mouse model. Our results indicate that ginkgetin effectively inhibits K562 cell proliferation, and TNF-alpha plays a key role in ginkgetin-induced cell apoptosis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*chronic lymphoblastic leukemia', '*ginkgetin', '*tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,['Z Naturforsch C. 2017 Oct 26;72 (11-12):507.

However, the cellular mechanisms involved in wound healing by HCECs have not been fully determined. In this review, we focus on the effects of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), a DNA-binding transcription factor, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 on the proliferation and migration of cultured HCECs. Involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in the migration of HCECs was also investigated. Expression of PLZF mRNA decreased as cell-cell contact was disrupted and returned to the original level as cell-cell contact was re-formed. Assessment with a real-time cell electronic sensing system revealed that proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited after infection with Ad-PLZF and exposure to TGF-beta2. Migration of cultured HCECs was increased by TGF-beta2 through p38 MAPK activation. We conclude that PLZF expression in cultured HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contact and that TGF-beta2 suppresses proliferation of cultured HCECs, while promoting their migration through p38 MAPK activation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that exposure to TiO2NPs had only minor effects on genome-wide DNA methylation. However, we identified 755 CpG sites showing consistent DNA hypomethylation in cells exposed to MWCNTs.

Epub 2017 Nov 2.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The poor prognosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL) means there is a need to develop novel therapeutic methods to treat this condition. It was recently shown that inducing megakaryoblasts to undergo terminal differentiation is effective as a treatment for AMKL. This encouraged us to identify a compound that induces megakaryocyte differentiation, which could then act as a potent anti-leukaemia agent. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of tetrandrine on the expression of CD41 and cell morphology were investigated in AMKL cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system to knock out ATG7 and verify the role of autophagy in tetrandrine-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. shNotch1 and CA-Akt were transfected into K562 cells to examine the downstream pathways of ROS signalling and the mechanistic basis of the tetrandrine-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. The anti-leukaemia effects of tetrandrine were analysed both in vitro and in vivo. KEY RESULTS: A low dose of tetrandrine induced cell cycle arrest and megakaryocyte differentiation in AMKL cells via activation of autophagy. Molecularly, we demonstrated that this effect is mediated by activation of Notch1 and Akt and subsequent accumulation of ROS. In contrast, in normal mouse fetal liver cells, although tetrandrine induced autophagy, it did not affect cell proliferation or promote megakaryocyte differentiation, suggesting a specific effect of tetrandrine in malignant megakaryoblasts. Finally, tetrandrine also showed in vivo efficacy in an AMKL xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Modulating autophagy-mediated differentiation may be a novel strategy for treating AMKL, and tetrandrine has the potential to be developed as a differentiation-inducing agent for AMKL chemotherapy.",['(c) 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.'],,,PMC5715583,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the role of the interaction with neutrophils on the functions of gastric cancer cells in vitro. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells (HL-60N) using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Human gastric cancer cells were co-cultured with HL-60N cells or treated with the conditioned medium (CM) of cancer-activated HL-60N cells. The migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells were significantly enhanced while their proliferation was minimally altered. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha was significantly increased in cancer-activated HL-60N cells, which induced the activation of the ERK pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells. Blocking the ERK pathway activation reversed the promoting effects of cancer-activated HL-60N cells on gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, mouse gastric cancer cell derived CM could also increase the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in mouse bone marrow neutrophils, which in turn enhanced the migration and invasion of mouse gastric cancer cells. Collectively, our findings revealed that the interaction with neutrophils promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion through the activation of the ERK pathway and the induction of EMT, indicating that neutrophils may play an important role in gastric cancer metastasis. Therefore, targeting neutrophil-cancer cell interaction may provide a new strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow samples were collected from patients with CML, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from healthy controls. Protein and mRNA were extracted from the collected samples, and analyzed using western blotting and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, respectively. Spearman's method was used to evaluate the correlation between the expression levels of these two genes, with P<0.05 considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. A total of 79 patients, including 57 patients with newly diagnosed CML and 22 patients treated with imatinib therapy, and 30 controls were enrolled. The expression of SOX4 was upregulated in the patients with CML, whereas the expression of C/EBPalpha was downregulated (P<0.05). However, no differences were observed among the chronic, accelerated and blastic CML phases, respectively (P>0.05). In addition, no associations were found between the changes in expression and age, gender, white blood cells or the expression of breakpoint cluster region/abelson in patients (P>0.05). However, the expression of SOX4 was negatively correlated with the expression of C/EBPalpha (P<0.01). Following imatinib treatment, the expression of SOX4 was downregulated in the progressionfree patients, but upregulated in the blastic phase patients, whereas the expression of C/EBPalpha showed the opposite trend. Therefore, C/EBPalpha and SOX4 were important and negatively associated with the process of CML, and the C/EBPalphaSOX4 axis may be a novel potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unclear. In the present study, 27 mice with AR induced by ovalbumin were randomly allocated to one of three groups: Model group, model group with IB treatment for 2 weeks, and model group with IB treatment for 4 weeks. Allergic symptoms were evaluated according to symptoms scores. Differentially expressed genes [microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs)] of nasal mucosa were identified by microarray analysis. The expression levels of candidate genes were measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). The data indicates that the symptoms scores in allergic mice were significantly reduced by IB treatment. In the nasal mucosa of allergic mice with IB treatment, 207 mRNAs and 87 miRNAs were differentially expressed, when compared with the sham group. IB treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of interleukin4Ralpha and prostaglandin D2 synthase, whereas the leukemia inhibitory factor, A20 and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 expression levels were upregulated. Similarly, the expression levels of mmumiR1243p/5p, 133b5p, 133a3p/5p, 3843p, 181a5p, 378a5p and 30715p were significantly increased. RTqPCR data further validated these mRNA and miRNA expression levels.

Fragment-based design led to the development of clinical candidates that target Bcl-xL/Bcl-2. Although these BclxL/ Bcl-2 inhibitors showed promise in pre-clinical studies, resistance to several Bcl-xL inhibitors was observed, when used alone. This is attributed to the over-expression of Mcl-1, another member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Indeed, Mcl-1 is highly amplified in numerous cancers, suggesting that it may contribute to malignant cell growth and evasion of apoptosis. Therefore, significant efforts have been made toward the development of direct Mcl-1 inhibitors for cancer therapy. METHODS: Following an extensive search of peer-reviewed articles on the development of Mcl-1-selective inhibitors, the literature retrieved is chronologically arranged and discussed in this review article. RESULTS: We have included 147 articles in this review; including articles that describe the development of stapled peptides with improved binding affinity as Mcl-1-selective BH3 mimetics, those describing fragment-based and structure-based design of small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors by various research groups, and those detailing the use of natural products and their derivatives as potential Mcl-1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic potential of targeting the Mcl-1 protein for cancer drug discovery is vast. Stapling BH3 peptides, as well as the development of small molecule inhibitors as BH3 mimetics, are viable strategies to develop selective Mcl-1 inhibitors. With no clinically approved candidate in hand, additional modes of perturbing the biological function of this protein will aid drug discovery efforts.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['BH3-mimetics', 'Bcl-2', 'Bcl-xL', 'Cancer', 'Mcl-1', 'apoptosis', 'small molecule inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is no effective treatment for ATL. Thymoquinone has been reported to have anti-cancer properties. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigatthe effects of TQ on proliferation, apoptosis induction and the underlying mechanism of action in both HTLV-1 positive (C91-PL and HuT-102) and HTLV-1 negative (CEM and Jurkat) malignant T-lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were incubated with different thymoquinone concentrations for 24h. Cell cytotoxicity was assayed using the CytoTox 96(R) Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit. Cell proliferation was determined using CellTiter 96(R) Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation. Cell cycle analysis was performed by staining with propidium iodide. Apoptosis was assessed using cell death ELISA kit. The effect of TQ on p53, p21, Bcl-2 protein expression was determined using Western blot analysis while TGF mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: At non-cytotoxic concentrations of TQ, it resulted in the inhibition of proliferation in a dose dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a shift in the cell cycle distribution to the PreG1 phase which is a marker of apoptosis. Also TQ increase DNA fragmentation. TQ mediated its anti-proliferative effect and apoptosis induction by an up-regulation of TGFbeta1, p53 and p21 and a down-regulation of TGF-alpha and Bcl-2alpha. CONCLUSION: Thymoquinone presents antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in ATL cells. For this reason, further research is required to investigate its possible application in the treatment of ATL.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*HTLV-1', '*TGF family', '*Thymoquinone', '*p21 and Bcl-2alpha', '*p53.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. OBJECTIVES: We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time-to-event data. We meta-analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse-variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow-up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight-year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined-modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended-field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). Chemotherapy plus lower-dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher-dose radiation (early stages). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower-radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages). Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. Dose-intensified versus ABVD-like chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced-stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard-dose ABVD-like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight-year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD-like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated-dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD-like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence).Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow-up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced-dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long-term follow-up in this meta-analysis, further long-term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.",,,,PMC6483617,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a large records-based case-control study of childhood leukemia risk and exposure to magnetic fields from power lines in California. METHODS: The study included 5,788 childhood leukemia cases (born in and diagnosed in California 1986-2008) matched to population-based controls on age and sex. We calculated magnetic fields at birth addresses using geographic information systems, aerial imagery, historical information on load and phasing, and site visits. RESULTS: Based on unconditional logistic regression controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status using subjects geocoded to a basic standard of accuracy, we report a slight risk deficit in two intermediate exposure groups and a small excess risk in the highest exposure group (odds ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval [0.70, 3.23])). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses as well as matched analyses gave similar results. All estimates had wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: Our large, statewide, record-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in California does not in itself provide clear evidence of risk associated with greater exposure to magnetic fields from power lines, but could be viewed as consistent with previous findings of increased risk.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Case-control study', 'Childhood leukemia', 'EMF', 'GIS', 'Magnetic fields']",PMC5706765,['P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS922184'],,['Cancer Causes Control. 2018 Jul;29(7):609-610.

METHODS: Patients who received T-cell replete peripheral hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute leukemia were identified. ALC cut-off was established using ROC analysis and subsequently the cohort was stratified. Time to endpoint analysis and cox regression modelling was computed to analyze outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Optimal ALC cut-off was established to be on day 14 (D14) with ALC > 0.3 x 10(9)/L. At 2 years, cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.9% vs 46.9% (P = 0.025) for early and delayed lymphocyte recovery cohorts, respectively. Chronic graft vs host disease was more prevalent in the early lymphocyte recovery (ELR) group at 70% vs 27%, respectively (P = 0.0006). On multivariable analysis for relapse, ELR retained its prognostic significance with HR = 0.27 (0.05-0.94, P = 0.038).

However, it remains a critical clinical problem with regard to its toxicity and drug-resistance. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that is pivotal in maintaining cell metabolic homeostasis. It is reported that AMPK is involved in vincristine-induced apoptosis. However, whether AMPK is involved in chemotherapy-resistance is largely unclear. It is well-documented that metformin, a widely used medicine to treat type II diabetes, possesses anti-cancer activities, yet whether metformin affects leukemia cell viability via vincristine is unknown. In this study, we showed that both AMPKalpha1 mRNA and phosphorylated AMPK protein levels were significantly decreased in clinical leukemia samples. We further demonstrated that metformin sensitized leukemia cells to vincristine-induced apoptosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. In addition, knockdown of AMPKalpha1 significantly reduced the effects of metformin on vincristine-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that AMPK activation is critical in metformin effects on vincristine-induced apoptosis and suggest a putative strategy of a combination therapy using metformin and vincristine in treatment of leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AMP-activated Protein Kinase', 'Apoptosis', 'Combination Therapy', 'Leukemia', 'Metformin', 'Vincristine']",PMC5595093,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,

These patients are at risk of metabolic syndrome (MS). The present study aimed to follow the patients with ALL regarding the incidence of MS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on all patients who referred to the oncology clinic from July 2012 to July 2013. The exclusion criteria of the study were ALL relapse, secondary malignancy, hypothyroidism, Down syndrome, and below 2 years of age. ALL had to be diagnosed at least 12 months before enrollment into this study. MS was assessed by serum triglyceride, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, leptin, and insulin levels. Besides, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) were measured at diagnosis and at the last visit. RESULTS: This study was conducted on 53 patients (male = 35, female = 18). At the end of the study, 13 patients (24.53%) were overweight compared to 3 patients at diagnosis (P = 0.04). The mean blood leptin level was higher in overweight patients compared to the others (P = 0.001). MS was detected in 21 patients (39.6%), including 12 males and 9 females. In addition, the BMI Z-score significantly increased over the study period (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Being overweight is a complication of ALL treatment, which is associated with elevated blood leptin level and BMI Z-score. Therefore, MS criteria, such as BP, weight, and serum triglyceride level, should be taken into account in each visit.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'body mass index', 'leptin', 'metabolic syndrome', 'overweight']",PMC5582576,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed a microwave irradiation method that kills cultured cancer cells, including a human promyelomonocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell line, by maintaining a cellular temperature of 37 degrees C during treatment. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying HL-60 cell death during this treatment. The microwave-irradiated HL-60 cells appear to undergo caspase-independent apoptosis, whereby DNA fragmentation was induced by mitochondrial dysfunction-related expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Caspase-dependent apoptosis was also interrupted by the loss of apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and caspase 9. Moreover, these cells did not exhibit a heat-stress response, as shown by the lack of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) upregulation. Alternatively, in HL-60 cells heated at 42.5 degrees C, HSP70 expression was upregulated and a pathway resembling death receptor-induced apoptosis was activated while mitochondrial function was maintained.

The efficacy of pegylated ADI (ADI-PEG20) in relapsed/refractory/poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was evaluated in 43 patients in a prospective, phase II trial (NCT01910012 (10/07/2013), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01910012?term = ADI-PEG20&rank = 12 ). Despite almost all pre-treatment tumor samples showing ASS deficiency, the best response among 21 evaluable patients was complete response (CR) in 2 (9.5%) and stable disease in 7 (33.3%), yielding a disease control rate (DCR) of 42.9%. The response durations of the two patients with CR were 7.5 and 8.8 months. DCR was correlated with a median of 8 weeks of arginine depletion to </=10 muM. Using whole transcriptome sequencing, we compared gene expression profiling of pre- and post-treatment bone marrow samples of the two responders and three non-responders. The expression levels of some markers for AML subtypes and c-MYC regulated genes were considered potential predictors of response to ADI-PEG20. These results suggest that ASS deficiency is a prerequisite but not a sufficient condition for response to ADI-PEG20 monotherapy in AML.

Epub 2017 Sep 12.,"The transcription factor C/EBPalpha is essential for myeloid differentiation and is frequently dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. Although studied extensively, the precise regulation of its gene by upstream factors has remained largely elusive. Here, we investigated its transcriptional activation during myeloid differentiation. We identified an evolutionarily conserved octameric sequence, CCCAGCAG, approximately 100 bases upstream of the CEBPA transcription start site, and demonstrated through mutational analysis that this sequence is crucial for C/EBPalpha expression. This sequence is present in the genes encoding C/EBPalpha in humans, rodents, chickens, and frogs and is also present in the promoters of other C/EBP family members. We identified that ZNF143, the human homolog of the Xenopus transcriptional activator STAF, specifically binds to this 8-bp sequence to activate C/EBPalpha expression in myeloid cells through a mechanism that is distinct from that observed in liver cells and adipocytes. Altogether, our data suggest that ZNF143 plays an important role in the expression of C/EBPalpha in myeloid cells.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*C/EBPalpha', '*CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)', '*ZNF143', '*gene regulation', '*hematopoiesis', '*promoter', '*transcription factor']",PMC5704476,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA178301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to self-antigens, a number of microbial antigens have been proposed to contribute to the selection of the immunoglobulins expressed in CLL. How pathogen-specific BCRs drive CLL development remains, however, largely unexplored. Here, we utilized mouse models of CLL pathogenesis to equip B cells with virus-specific BCRs and study the effect of antigen recognition on leukemia growth. Our results show that BCR engagement is absolutely required for CLL development. Unexpectedly, however, neither acute nor chronic exposure to virus-derived antigens influenced leukemia progression. Rather, CLL clones preferentially selected light chains that, when paired with virus-specific heavy chains, conferred B cells the ability to recognize a broad range of autoantigens. Taken together, our results suggest that pathogens may drive CLL pathogenesis by selecting and expanding pathogen-specific B cells that cross-react with one or more self-antigens.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Sep 9.,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in the late 1980s, has caused economic losses to the poultry industry in many countries. As all chicken lines studied to date are susceptible to ALV infection, there is enormous interest in developing resistant chicken lines. The ALV-J receptor, chicken Na(+)/H(+) exchange 1 (chNHE1) and the critical amino acid sequences involved in viral attachment and entry have already been characterized. However, there are no reported attempts to induce resistance to the virus by targeted genome modification of the receptor sequences. In an attempt to induce resistance to ALV-J infection, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (CRISPR/Cas9)-based genome editing approaches to modify critical residues of the chNHE1 receptor in chicken cells. The susceptibility of the modified cell lines to ALV-J infection was examined using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing marker viruses. We showed that modifying the chNHE1 receptor by artificially generating a premature stop codon induced absolute resistance to viral infection, with mutations of the tryptophan residue at position 38 (Trp38) being very critical. Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-mediated targeted recombination of the Trp38 region revealed that deletions involving the Trp38 residue were most effective in conferring resistance to ALV-J. Moreover, protein structure analysis of the chNHE1 receptor sequence suggested that its intrinsically disordered region undergoes local conformational changes through genetic alteration. Collectively, these results demonstrate that targeted mutations on chNHE1 alter the susceptibility to ALV-J and the technique is expected to contribute to develop disease-resistant chicken lines.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We report two cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) relapsed as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data. Results: Complex cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in B-ALL for both cases with subclone heterogeneity. Postchemotherapy marrow biopsies showed trilineage hematopoiesis without detectable B-ALL. Cytogenetics in both showed stemline abnormalities. The cases were considered ""occult"" myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) preceding B-ALL. The patients relapsed 6.5 and 9 months following induction, respectively. Case 1 relapsed as AML-M5 initially, was treated as such, and then relapsed again as B-ALL. Case 2 relapsed as AML-M6. Cytogenetics demonstrated persistent abnormalities. Both patients died soon after relapse. Conclusions: Lineage switch between B-ALL and AML could be intermediated by occult MDS. A pluripotent progenitor likely undergoes neoplastic transformation, resulting in a genomically unstable clone. This leads to a repertoire of heterogeneous subclones that may be selected by chemotherapy. Lineage switch heralds a dismal clinical outcome.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Here, we mechanistically link caspase-8-dependent apoptosis to HCC development via proliferation- and replication-associated DNA damage. Proliferation-associated replication stress, DNA damage, and genetic instability are detectable in CLDs before any neoplastic changes occur. Accumulated levels of hepatocyte apoptosis determine and predict subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis. Proliferation-associated DNA damage is sensed by a complex comprising caspase-8, FADD, c-FLIP, and a kinase-dependent function of RIPK1. This platform requires a non-apoptotic function of caspase-8, but no caspase-3 or caspase-8 cleavage. It may represent a DNA damage-sensing mechanism in hepatocytes that can act via JNK and subsequent phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

The role of HBV prophylaxis in this setting is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) prophylaxis versus close monitoring in antiHBc-positive, HBsAg-negative patients under treatment with rituximab (RTX)-based regimens for hematologic malignancy. METHODS: PREBLIN is a phase IV, randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group trial conducted in 17 hospitals throughout Spain. Anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg-negative patients with undetectable HBV DNA were randomized to receive TDF 300 mg once daily (Group I) or observation (Group II). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients showing HBV reactivation during 18 months following initiation of RTX treatment. Patients with detectable HBV DNA (Group III) received the same dose of TDF and were analyzed together with Group I to investigate TDF safety. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study, 33 in the TDF treatment group and 28 in the observation group. By ITT analysis, HBV reactivation was 0% (0/33) in the study group and 10.7% (3/28) in the observation group (p = 0.091). None of the patients in either group showed significant differences in liver function parameters between baseline and the last follow-up sample. TDF was generally well tolerated and there were no severe treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION: In patients with hematological malignancy and resolved hepatitis B infection receiving RTX-based regimens, HBV reactivation did not occur in patients given TDF prophylaxis.",,,,PMC5595327,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2018 Jun 25;13(6):e0199926.

In addition, plasma baselines for some analytes that are biomarkers for other cancers have not been previously reported in AML. METHODS: We used multiplex array technology to simultaneously detect and quantify 32 plasma analyte (22 reported analytes and 10 novel analytes) levels in 38 patients. RESULTS: In our study, 16 analytes are found to be significantly deregulated (13 higher, 3 lower, Mann-Whitney U-test, P-value <0.005), where 5 of them have never been reported before in AML. We predicted a seven-analyte-containing multiplex panel for diagnosis of AML and, among them, MIF could be a possible therapeutic target.

Epub 2017 Aug 26.,"Type I interferons (IFNs) such as IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-epsilon, IFN-kappa, and IFN-omega represent cytokines, which are deeply involved in the regulation and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. They possess strong antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities allowing their use in the therapy of different viral diseases, neoplasms, and immune-mediated disorders, respectively. Initially, treatment strategies were based on nonspecific inducers of type I IFNs, which were soon replaced by different recombinant proteins. Drugs with type I IFNs as active agents are currently used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C virus infection, lymphoma, myeloid leukemia, renal carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and multiple sclerosis in humans. In addition, recombinant feline IFN-omega has been approved for the treatment of canine parvovirus, feline leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus infections. However, the role of type I IFNs in the pathogenesis of canine diseases remains largely undetermined so far, even though some share pathogenic mechanisms and clinical features with their human counterparts. This review summarizes the present knowledge of type I IFNs and down-stream targets such as Mx and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase proteins in the pathogenesis of infectious and immune-mediated canine diseases. Moreover, studies investigating the potential use of type I IFNs in the treatment of canine lymphomas, melanomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas, canine distemper virus, parvovirus, and papillomavirus infections as well as immune-mediated keratoconjunctivitis sicca and atopic dermatitis are presented. A separate chapter is dedicated to the therapeutic potential of IFN-lambda, a type III IFN, in canine diseases. However, further future studies are still needed to unravel the exact functions of the different subtypes of type I IFNs and their target genes in healthy and diseased dogs and the full potential action of type I IFNs as treatment strategy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Lymphoma of T cell type in particular is variable in outcome, and includes subtypes with non-progressive, slowly- and rapidly-progressive disease course. Association of immunotype with disease course is incompletely defined. Here, results of flow cytometric immunotyping of 127 canine T cell lymphomas were analyzed in relation to survival and progression free interval. Samples originated from 101 multicentric, 8 mediastinal, 6 cutaneous, 5 hepatosplenic, 5 gastrointestinal and 2 other anatomic subtypes of T cell lymphoma. Compared to multicentric T cell lymphoma, gastrointestinal lymphoma had shorter survival and progression free interval, and hepatosplenic lymphoma had shorter survival. Among dogs with multicentric T cell lymphoma, immunotypes of CD4(+)/CD8(-)/MHCII(+), CD4(-)/CD8(+)/MHCII(+) and CD4(-)/CD8(+)/MHCII(-) were associated with longer survival times than the immunotype of CD4(+)/CD8(-)/MHCII(-), and immunotypes of CD4(+)/CD8(-)/MHCII(+), CD4(-)/CD8(+)/MHCII(-), and CD4(-)/CD8(-)/MHCII(+) were associated with longer progression free intervals. Dogs with multicentric T cell lymphoma and concurrent leukemia had shorter survival but similar progression free interval compared to those without leukemia.

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) became of special interest in this setting as they are associated with unfavorable prognosis. Because of sequence-dependent protein conformational changes FLT3-ITD tends to autophosphorylate and displays a constitutive intracellular localization. Here, we analyzed the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the localization of the FLT3 receptor and its mutants. TKI treatment increased the surface expression through upregulation of FLT3 and glycosylation of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835Y mutants. In T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TCMC) assays, using a bispecific FLT3 x CD3 antibody construct, the combination with TKI treatment increased TCMC in the FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, patient-derived xenograft cells and primary patient samples. Our findings provide the basis for rational combination of TKI and FLT3-directed immunotherapy with potential benefit for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients.",,,,PMC5808080,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 19.,"INTRODUCTION: AKR1C3 is a drug target in hormonal and hormonal independent malignancies and acts as a major peripheral 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and as a prostaglandin (PG) F synthase to produce proliferative ligands for the PG FP receptor. AKR1C3 inhibitors may have distinct advantages over existing therapeutics for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer, breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Area covered: This article reviews the patent literature on AKR1C3 inhibitors using SciFinder which identified inhibitors in the following chemical classes: N-phenylsulfonyl-indoles, N-(benzimidazoylylcarbonyl)- N-(indoylylcarbonyl)- and N-(pyridinepyrrolyl)- piperidines, N-benzimidazoles and N-benzindoles, repurposed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (indole acetic acids, N-phenylanthranilates and aryl propionic acids), isoquinolines, and nitrogen and sulfur substituted estrenes. The article evaluates inhibitor AKR potency, specificity, efficacy in cell-based and xenograft models and clinical utility.

Epub 2017 Oct 16.,"OBJECTIVES: We conducted a phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in patients newly diagnosed with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML-CP) in Japan (IMIDAS PART 2 study). METHODS: Seventy-nine patients were administered 100 mg dasatinib once daily. We examined pretreatment and post-treatment influences of various factors. The BCR-ABL1 international scale (IS), halving time (HT) and reduction rate of BCR-ABL1 transcript within the initial 1 or 3 months of therapy (RR-BCR-ABL11m,3m ) were the post-treatment factors investigated to predict the molecular response. RESULTS: The estimated major molecular response (MMR), molecular response 4.0 (MR4.0) and molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) rates were 77.2%, 49.4% and 35.4%, respectively, at 12 months. Grade 3/4 non-haematologic adverse events were infrequent. Multivariate analysis showed that age >65 years was significantly correlated with MR4.0 and MR4.5 (deep molecular response: DMR) at 12 months. All post-treatment factors at 3 months predicted DMR by univariate analysis. However, RR-BCR-ABL13m was the only significant landmark for predicting DMR by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Primary treatment of CML-CP with dasatinib enabled early achievement of MMR and DMR, particularly in elderly patients, with high safety. Furthermore, RR-BCR-ABL13m was found to be a more useful predictor of DMR than HT-BCR-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 IS.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2017 Sep 11.,"The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha (CEBPA) and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) genes have been traditionally regarded as two essential genes involved in normal myeloid maturation. Although the link between mutations in these genes and the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been extensively documented, the ramifications of gene expression dysregulations of CEBPA and RUNX1 has drawn less attention. The present study investigated CEBPA and RUNX1 gene expression levels in 96 primary AML specimens against a normal control group by way of real-time RT-PCR. Our results reveal that CEBPA and RUNX1 gene expression levels were unexpectedly and significantly higher in patients with AML when compared to the levels detected in the normal control group (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the correlation between CEBPA and RUNX1 was significant and positive (P-value: 0.011, r: 0.257). Our data contradicts the widely established role of CEBPA and RUNX1 in myeloid differentiation, as we saw lower levels of CEBPA and RUNX1 expression to be exhibited in patients with AML. Likely, our data demonstrates that higher levels of CEBPA and RUNX1 expression were closely correlated with reduced myeloid maturation, but this idea needs to approved. It suggests that despite the current established functions of genes involved in cell differentiation, the leukemogenesis process has the capability to transform normal hematopoietic precursors in a manner that may employ the differentiation related gene at the service of malignancy.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/University College London.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'CEBPA', 'RUNX1', 'malignancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 11.,PURPOSE: To explore health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) profiles and identify socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with HRQoL in persons with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to adults with chronic-phase CML receiving tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) therapy >3 months in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Respondents were anonymous. SF-36 Health Survey was used to measure HRQoL. RESULTS: Data from 828 respondents were analyzable. 524 (63%) were male. Median age was 42 years (range 18-88 years). 648 (78%) were receiving imatinib. Median TKI-therapy duration was 36 months (range 3-178 months). 638 (77%) paid some or all of their TKI costs. Annual out-of-pocket expenses >$4600 USD was associated with lower physical component summary (PCS; -2.8 to -3.8; P = 0.0081 and 0.0009) and mental component summary (MCS; -2.1 to -4.3; P = 0.0394 and 0.0080) in multivariate analyses. Other variables significantly associated with a lower PCS and/or MCS included: (1) female sex; (2) increasing age; (3) education level < bachelor degree; (4) co-morbidity(ies); and (5) generic drug use. TKI-therapy duration 3-5 years was associated with higher PCS and MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Higher out-of-pocket expense for TKI therapy is significantly associated with worse HRQoL in persons with chronic-phase CML in CCyR receiving TKI therapy.

In this study, we have stratified AML patients into those defined as having a normal karyotype (CN-AML). Unlike the overall pattern in AML, those patients with CN-AML have a poorer survival rate when GFI1 expression is high. In this group, high GFI1 expression is paralleled by higher FLT3 expression, and, even when the FLT3 gene is not mutated, exhibit a FLT3-ITD signature of gene expression.

HTLV-1 transmits primarily through cell-to-cell contact, and generates abundant infected cells in the host in order to survive and transmit to a new host. The resulting high proviral load is closely associated with the development of ATL and inflammatory diseases. To increase the number of infected cells, HTLV-1 changes the immunophenotype of infected cells, induces proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through the cooperative actions of two viral genes, tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ). As a result, infected cells survive, proliferate and infiltrate into the tissues, which is critical for transmission of the virus. Thus, the strategy of this virus is indivisibly linked with its pathogenesis, providing a clue for prevention and treatment of HTLV-1-induced diseases.This article is part of the themed issue 'Human oncogenic viruses'.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.'],['NOTNLM'],"['HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax']",PMC5597739,['100291/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults with an overall poor prognosis and very limited treatment management. Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1 alone or combined with other immune checkpoint blockade has gained impressive results in murine AML models by improving anti-leukemia CD8(+)T cell function, which has greatly promoted the strategy to utilize combined immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat AML patients. However, the expression profiles of these immune checkpoint receptors, such as co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT and co-stimulatory receptor CD226, in T cells from AML patients have not been clearly defined. Here we have defined subsets of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in the peripheral blood (PB) from newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy controls (HCs). We have observed increased frequencies of PD-1- and TIGIT- expressing CD8(+) T cells but decreased occurrence of CD226-expressing CD8(+)T cells in AML patients. Further analysis of these CD8(+) T cells revealed a unique CD8(+) T cell subset that expressed PD-1 and TIGIT but displayed lower levels of CD226 was associated with failure to achieve remission after induction chemotherapy and FLT3-ITD mutations which predict poor clinical prognosis in AML patients. Importantly, these PD-1(+)TIGIT(+)CD226(-)CD8(+)T cells are dysfunctional with lower expression of intracellular IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha than their counterparts in HCs. Therefore, our studies revealed that an increased frequency of a unique CD8(+) T cell subset, PD-1(+)TIGIT(+)CD226(-)CD8(+)T cells, is associated with CD8(+)T cell dysfunction and poor clinical prognosis of AML patients, which may reveal critical diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and direct more efficient therapeutic strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Epub 2017 Sep 9.,"MED26 is a subunit of Mediator, a large complex central to the regulation of gene transcription by RNA Polymerase II. MED26 plays a role in the switch between the initiation and elongation phases of RNA Polymerase II-mediated transcription process. Regulation of these steps requires successive binding of MED26 N-terminal domain (NTD) to TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7 (TAF7) and Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich in leukemia-Associated Factor 1 (EAF1). In order to investigate the mechanism of regulation by MED26, MED26-NTD structure was solved by NMR, revealing a 4-helix bundle. EAF1 (239-268) and TAF7 (205-235) peptide interactions were both mapped to the same groove formed by H3 and H4 helices of MED26-NTD. Both interactions are characterized by dissociation constants in the 10-muM range. Further experiments revealed a folding-upon-binding mechanism that leads to the formation of EAF1 (N247-S260) and TAF7 (L214-S227) helices. Chemical shift perturbations and nuclear Overhauser enhancement contacts support the involvement of residues I222/F223 in anchoring TAF7 helix to a hydrophobic pocket of MED26-NTD, including residues L48, W80 and I84. In addition, Ala mutations of charged residues located in the C-terminal disordered part of TAF7 and EAF1 peptides affected the binding, with a loss of affinity characterized by a 10-time increase of dissociation constants. A structural model of MED26-NTD/TAF7 complex shows bi-partite components, combining ordered and disordered segments, as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to the binding. This study provides molecular detail that will help to decipher the mechanistic basis for the initiation to elongation switch-function mediated by MED26-NTD.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The next-generation CD20 antibody obinutuzumab represents an addition to the drug armamentarium used for the therapeutic management of patients with LPDs. Areas covered: Herein, the authors discuss the biochemical and conformational engineering of obinutuzumab to increase antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and direct cell death. They also describe the available preclinical data on obinutuzumab's role in B-cell LPDs. Furthermore, the authors summarize the Phase I and II clinical trials of obinutuzumab, focusing on the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, the most common clinically significant adverse events, dose optimization, and clinical outcomes of patients with CLL and other B-cell LPDs treated with obinutuzumab as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. To put these data in perspective, the use of obinutuzumab is compared with that of rituximab in CLL and other B-cell LPDs. Expert opinion: Clinical trials have demonstrated that obinutuzumab is well tolerated. The novel mechanism of action of obinutuzumab is associated with significant efficacy in CLL and other B-cell LPDs. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to determine the optimal use of obinutuzumab in these diseases.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD20', '*Monoclonal antibody', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*obinutuzumab', '*rituximab']",PMC6166403,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1505142'],,,,,,,

The incidence varies between 3-9.1% of acute leukaemia cases. The blast infiltration is seen most commonly in skin, lymph node, gastrointestinal tract, bone, soft tissue though can involve any body site usually as a solitary lesion and is rarely seen in nasal cavity. We present two cases of myeloid sarcoma presenting as a nasal mass in a six year old girl and other as orbital mass in 32-year-old as an initial manifestation of acute myeloid leukaemia. Histopathological examination along with immunohistochemistry clinched the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed blasts which fulfilled the criteria for acute leukaemia. These cases are usually misdiagnosed because often lymphoma and granulocytic sarcoma is not considered in initial list of differential diagnoses. These rare cases are being presented here as early recognition and diagnosis will ensure rapid treatment of the condition and improve the survival.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chloroma', 'Hepatosplenomegaly', 'Lymphocytes']",PMC5583775,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of c-Rel is detected in many human B cell tumors, including B-cell leukemia and several cancers. The study aimed to investigate the effects of c-Rel siRNA on the proliferation and apoptosis of relapsed pre-B acute leukemia cells. The c-Rel siRNA was transfected into Leukemia cells using an Amaxa cell line Nucleofector kit L (Lonza). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were done to measure the expression levels of mRNA and protein, respectively. The flow cytometry was used to analyze the effect of c-Rel siRNA on the apoptosis and proliferation of Leukemia cells. Observed c-Rel expression in the 5 pre-B Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were higher than the normal cells. The c-Rel siRNA transfection significantly blocked the expression of c-Rel mRNA in a time-dependent manner, leading to a strong growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis (P<0.05). Our results demonstrated that c-Rel plays a fundamental role in the survival. Therefore, c-Rel can be considered as an attractive target for gene therapy in ALL patients. Also siRNA-mediated silencing of this gene may be a novel strategy in ALL treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 11.,"Purpose Previous US studies have shown that socioeconomic status (SES) affects survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no large study has investigated the association between education or income and clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome in AML. Methods To investigate the effects of education and income in a tax-supported health care system, we conducted a population-based study using individual-level SES and clinical data on all Danish patients with AML (2000 to 2014). We compared treatment intensity, allogeneic transplantation, and response rates by education and income level using logistic regression (odds ratios). We used Cox regression (hazard ratios [HRs]) to compare survival, adjusting for age, sex, SES, and clinical prognostic markers. Results Of 2,992 patients, 1,588 (53.1%) received intensive chemotherapy. Compared with low-education patients, highly educated patients more often received allogeneic transplantation (16.3% v 8.7%). In intensively treated patients younger than 60 years of age, increased mortality was observed in those with lower and medium education (1-year survival, 66.7%; adjusted HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.93; and 1-year survival, 67.6%; adjusted HR, 1.55; CI, 1.21 to 1.98, respectively) compared with higher education (1-year survival, 76.9%). Over the study period, 5-year survival improvements were limited to high-education patients (from 39% to 58%), increasing the survival gap between groups. In older patients, low-education patients received less intensive therapy (30% v 48%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; CI, 0.44 to 0.98) compared with high-education patients; however, remission rates and survival were not affected in those intensively treated. Income was not associated with therapy intensity, likelihood of complete remission, or survival (high income: adjusted HR, 1.0; medium income: adjusted HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12; low income: adjusted HR, 1.06; CI, .88 to 1.27). Conclusion In a universal health care system, education level, but not income, affects transplantation rates and survival in younger patients with AML. Importantly, recent survival improvement has exclusively benefitted highly educated patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purity of the AC-ARPS obtained by phenol/sulfuric acid method was 95.01%. The chemical structures of AC-ARPS were identified by a series of analytical methods including high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry indicated that AC-ARPS was mainly composed of mannose, ribose, glucose, galactose and arabinose with a molar ratio of 1.00:8.47:47.30:1.17:1.19. AC-ARPS is a homogeneous polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 25 681 Da. The antitumor effect of AC-ARPS was evaluated on lung cancer A549, osteosarcoma 143B, rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC 12, breast cancer MCF-7, acute leukemia HL 60, chronic leukemia K562, colon cancer SW620, esophageal cancer OE 19, liver cancer HepG2, and neuroglioma U251 cells in vitro. AC-ARPS showed the best inhibitory effect on OE 19 cells, and the IC50 value was 5.67 +/- 0.831 mumol/L.

Relevant observations have been made in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where gene mutations are distributed asymmetrically in cases bearing or not somatic hypermutations within the clonotypic immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes (e.g. TP53 mutations predominate in IG-unmutated CLL, whereas the opposite is seen for MYD88 mutations, enriched in IG-mutated CLL) and in subsets of cases with stereotyped IG (enrichment for SF3B1 mutations in CLL subset #2). Moreover, similar findings have been reported in splenic marginal-zone lymphoma, where KLF2 mutations are biased to cases expressing IGHV1-2*04 IG receptors, and in hairy cell leukemia, where IGHV4-34-expressing cases display a low frequency of BRAF mutations but a high frequency of MAP2K1 mutations. The list is now growing with the report of increased frequency of inactivating mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene in MALT lymphomas expressing IG receptors encoded by the IGHV4-34 gene, particularly of the ocular adnexa. Considering that TNFAIP3 encodes a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, this finding further highlights the importance of NF-kappaB pathway activation in the natural history of MALT lymphomas. Altogether, these findings allude to selection of genomic aberrations in lymphoma cases with distinctive immune signaling profiles linked to the expression of particular IG receptors.

These leukemias have a poor prognosis, and there are no approved therapeutic options. The rearrangement in the MLL gene leads to aberrant expression of MLL-fusion proteins. These are transforming in murine bone marrow and, in particular, on stem cells and myeloid progenitors derived from bone marrow or fetal liver. The commonality of the MLL fusions is the in-frame fusion of 8 to 11 N-terminal exons of MLL1 (KMT2a) with the C-terminus of a partner fusion gene. Currently, over 80 different fusion partners are known. The protocols detailed in this unit focus on bone marrow-derived models only, using one particular MLL fusion, MLL-AF9.

We previously identified an irreversible LSD1 inhibitor T-3775440, which exerts antileukemic activities in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines by inducing cell transdifferentiation. The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924, TAK-924) is an investigational drug with antiproliferative activities in AML, and is also reported to induce cell differentiation. We therefore tested the combination of these two agents in AML models. The combination treatment resulted in synergistic growth inhibition of AML cells, accompanied by enhanced transdifferentiation of an erythroid leukemia lineage into granulomonocytic-like lineage cells. In addition, pevonedistat-induced rereplication stress during the S phase was greatly augmented by concomitant treatment with T-3775440, as reflected by the increased induction of apoptosis. We further demonstrated that the combination treatment was markedly effective in subcutaneous tumor xenograft models as well as in a disseminated model of AML, leading to tumor eradication or prolonged survival in T-3775440/pevonedistat cotreated mice. Our findings indicate the therapeutic potential of the combination of LSD1 inhibitors and pevonedistat for the treatment of AML.",,,,PMC5623902,,,,,,,,,,['Oncogenesis. 2019 Sep 11;8(9):51.

To validate the use of the IPSS-R assessed before transplant rather than at diagnosis we performed a retrospective analysis of the EBMT database. A total of 579 patients had sufficient information available to calculate IPSS-R at transplant. Median overall survival (OS) from transplant was significantly different according to IPSS-R: very low 23.6 months, low 55.0 months, intermediate 19.7 months, high 13.5 months, very high 7.8 months (P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox model the following parameters were significant risk factors for OS: IPSS-R, graft source, age and prior treatment. Median relapse free survival also showed significant differences according to IPSS-R: very low: 23.6 months, low: 24.8 months, intermediate 10.6 months, high 7.9 months, very high 5.5 months (P<0.001). Multivariate risk factors for relapse-free survival (RFS) were: IPSS-R, reduced intensity conditioning, graft source and prior treatment. A trend for an increased relapse incidence was noted for very high risk IPSS-R. We conclude that the IPSS-R at transplant is a useful prognostic score for predicting OS and RFS after transplantation, capturing both disease evolution and response to prior treatment before transplant.",,,,PMC5671928,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 11.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), specific genomic aberrations induce aberrant methylation, thus directly influencing the transcriptional programing of leukemic cells. Therefore, therapies targeting epigenetic processes are advocated as a promising therapeutic tool for AML treatment. However, to develop new therapies, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) driving the epigenetic changes as a result of acquired genetic abnormalities is necessary. This understanding is still lacking. In this study, we performed genome-wide CpG-island methylation profiling on pediatric AML samples. Six differentially methylated genomic regions within two genes, discriminating inv(16)(p13;q22) from non-inv(16) pediatric AML samples, were identified. All six regions had a hypomethylated phenotype in inv(16) AML samples, and this was most prominent at the regions encompassing the meningioma (disrupted in balanced translocation) 1 (MN1) oncogene. MN1 expression primarily correlated with the methylation level of the 3' end of the MN1 exon-1 locus. Decitabine treatment of different cell lines showed that induced loss of methylation at the MN1 locus can result in an increase of MN1 expression, indicating that MN1 expression is coregulated by DNA methylation. To investigate this methylation-associated mechanism, we determined the expression of DNA methyltransferases in inv(16) AML. We found that DNMT3B expression was significantly lower in inv(16) samples. Furthermore, DNMT3B expression correlated negatively with MN1 expression in pediatric AML samples. Importantly, depletion of DNMT3B impaired remethylation efficiency of the MN1 exon-1 locus in AML cells after decitabine exposure. These findings identify DNMT3B as an important coregulator of MN1 methylation. Taken together, this study shows that the methylation level of the MN1 exon-1 locus regulates MN1 expression levels in inv(16) pediatric AML. This methylation level is dependent on DNMT3B, thus suggesting a role for DNMT3B in leukemogenesis in inv(16) AML, through MN1 methylation regulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects and action mechanisms of arenobufagin on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unknown. In this study, we reported that arenobufagin acted through activation of Noxa-related pathways and promoted apoptotic cell death in human NSCLC cells. Our results revealed that arenobufagin-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent, as evidenced by the fact that caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were cleaved, and pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited the pro-apoptosis effect of arenobufagin. Mechanistically, we further found that arenobufagin rapidly upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptosis protein Noxa, and abrogated the anti-apoptosis protein Mcl-1, a major binding partner of Noxa in the cell. More importantly, the knockdown of Noxa greatly blocked arenobufagin-induced cell death, highlighting the contribution of this protein in the anti-NSCLC effects of arenobufagin. Interestingly, arenobufagin also increased the expression of p53, a direct transcriptional activator for the upregulation of the Noxa protein. Taken together, our results suggest that arenobufagin is a potential anti-NSCLC agent that triggers apoptotic cell death in NSCLC cells through interfering with the Noxa-related pathway.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Noxa', 'arenobufagin', 'non-small-cell lung cancer', 'p53']",PMC6151516,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Primary B ALL in contact with OP9 stromal cells showed increased p-Akt(ser473). Idelalisib decreased p-Akt in patient samples of ALL with diverse genetic lesions. Addition of idelalisib to vincristine inhibited proliferation when compared to vincristine monotherapy in a subset of samples tested. Idelalisib inhibited ALL migration to SDF-1alpha in vitro and blocked homing of ALL cells to the bone marrow in vivo.

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the first neoplasm where the assessment of early response to therapy by minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring has proven to be a fundamental tool for guiding therapeutic choices. In recent years, thanks to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), MRD monitoring has further achieved higher levels of sensitivity and standardization. However, some outstanding issues still remain to be addressed and emerging technologies hold the promise of improving MRD detection in ALL patients. Areas covered: Through a comprehensive review of the literature, we analyze the state-of-the-art of molecular MRD assessment in ALL to better understand how, in the upcoming years, some of its limitations could be tackled by emerging molecular technologies. Furthermore, we highlight the future role of molecular MRD monitoring in the context of personalized protocols, taking into account the growing genetic complexity in ALL. Expert commentary: Although new molecular technologies are promising tools for MRD assessment, qPCR still remains the gold standard for evaluating MRD in ALL. High-throughput sequencing and droplet digital PCR allow to identify new prognostic factors and/or MRD targets at diagnosis and to perform earlier MRD evaluations, thereby optimizing patient stratification and earlier MRD-based clinical intervention to improve ALL patient outcomes.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MRD-guided clinical trials', '*Minimal residual disease', '*PCR-based high-throughput sequencing', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*droplet digital PCR', '*immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements', '*real-time quantitative PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the characteristics of hMDS, the data of 129 patients diagnosed between April 2003 and March 2012 were collected from 20 institutions and the central review team of the National Research Group on Idiopathic Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes, and compared with 115 non-hMDS patients. More RA and fewer CMMoL and RAEB-t in French-American-British (FAB) and more RCUD and MDS-U and fewer RCMD in World Health Organization (WHO) classifications were found in hMDS than non-hMDS with significant differences. The overall survival (OS) and AML progression-free survival (AML-PFS) of hMDS were higher than those of non-hMDS, especially in patients at age >/=50 and of lower risk in Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). In competing risks analysis, hMDS exhibited decreased risk of AML-progression in lower IPSS or IPSS-R risk patients, and higher risk of death from BMF in patients at age >/=50. Poor performance status (PS >/=2) and high karyotype risks in IPSS-R (high and very high) were significant risk factors of death and AML-progression in Cox proportional hazards analysis.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,['for National Research Group on Idiopathic Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes'],,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 14.,"AIM: To further characterize the selectivity, mechanism-of-action and therapeutic efficacy of the novel small molecule inhibitor, SKI-178. METHODS: Using the state-of-the-art Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) technique to detect ""direct target engagement"" of proteins intact cells, in vitro and in vivo assays, pharmacological assays and multiple mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Herein, we demonstrate that SKI-178 directly target engages both Sphingosine Kinase 1 and 2. We also present evidence that, in addition to its actions as a Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitor, SKI-178 functions as a microtubule network disrupting agent both in vitro and in intact cells. Interestingly, we separately demonstrate that simultaneous SphK inhibition and microtubule disruption synergistically induces apoptosis in AML cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SKI-178 is well tolerated in normal healthy mice. Most importantly, we demonstrate that SKI-178 has therapeutic efficacy in several mouse models of AML. CONCLUSION: SKI-178 is a multi-targeted agent that functions both as an inhibitor of the SphKs as well as a disruptor of the microtubule network. SKI-178 induced apoptosis arises from a synergistic interaction of these two activities. SKI-178 is safe and effective in mouse models of AML, supporting its further development as a multi-targeted anti-cancer therapeutic agent.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Sphingosine kinase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'microtubule disrupting agent', 'multi-targeted agent', 'polypharmacology', 'sphingosine kinase inhibitor']",PMC5590228,"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS900433'],,,,,,,

The expression profiling of miRNAs has already entered into cancer clinics as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to assess tumor initiation, progression and response to treatment in cancer patients. Recent studies have opened the way for the use of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to identify plasma miR-92a, miR-143 and miR-342 expression signatures in AML patients to introduce new markers for establishing AML diagnosis and prognosis. Blood samples were collected from 65 AML patients and 50 controls. The expression of three target miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-143 and miR-342) was measured using quantitative real-time PCR method. Plasma levels of miR-92a, miR-143 and miR-342 were significantly lower in AML patients in comparison with control group. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the sensitivity and specificity values of miR-92a were 81.5% and 94%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.704. The sensitivity and specificity values of miR-143 were 87.7% and 80%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.65. The sensitivity and specificity values of miR-342 were 75.4% and 90%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.479. Our findings suggest that plasma miR-92a, miR-143 and miR-342 could be promising novel circulating biomarkers in clinical detection of AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'acute', 'diagnosis', 'microRNAs', 'myeloid']",PMC5581549,,['The authors declared no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Ponatinib 45 mg once daily was then started together with a short course of chemotherapy. Bone marrow evaluation after six months of therapy showed the regaining of CCyR, together with the achievement of a deep molecular response. However, one year from ponatinib start the patient experienced a new disease relapse; he was effectively treated with ponatinib and chemotherapy once again, but in the meanwhile an ischemic stroke was detected.

With medical advancements, though cure rates have increased considerably, focus is now shifted to the potential early and late complications of the same. The aim of this study was to assess the early oral complications in pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy. Sixty-two children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy with the mean age of 7.42 +/- 3.6 years were included in the study. The various types of malignancies and oral problems during chemotherapy were recorded in the subjects. The most commonly encountered malignancy was acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 35.5%. Various oral and associated complications like mucosal inflammation with ulcerations, oral pain, xerostomia, and secondary infections were commonly seen, with mucositis being the most commonly observed complication in 58.1% of the subjects undergoing chemotherapy. Clinical importance of timely medical and dental interventions by a multidisciplinary team involving a pediatric dentist at different stages of anticancer treatment is also emphasized to minimize discomfort, increase treatment compliance, and improve the quality of life of pediatric patients.

Conversely, the relapse rates in the FB4 and FM140 groups were lower than that in the FB2 group (HR, .73 [P = .011]; and HR, .56 [P < .001], respectively). There were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) among the FB2, FB4, and FM140 groups. The 3-year OS in patients with high-risk AML and MDS in the FM140 group (37.0% and 60.2%) were superior to those in the FB2 group (24.4% and 45.5%) and the FB4 group (24.6% and 40.6%) (P = .016 and P = .023), whereas there were no differences in OS in the other patients among the 3 groups. In conclusion, the lower rates of relapse in the FB4 and FM140 groups were largely offset by a worse NRM. However, FM140 might be associated with better OS in patients with high-risk AML and MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is currently incurable despite many novel therapies. Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a potential anti-tumour agent although effects as a single agent are limited. In this study, we investigated whether the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and target TRAIL resistance in both suspension culture, and 3D cell culture as a model of disseminated MM lesions that form in bone. METHODS: The effects of SAHA and/or TRAIL in 6 Multiple Myeloma cell lines were assessed in both suspension cultures and in an Alginate-based 3D cell culture model. The effect of SAHA and/or TRAIL was assessed on apoptosis by assessment of nuclear morphology using Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide staining. Viable cell number was assessed by CellTiter-Glo luminescence assay, Caspase-8 and -9 activities were measured by Caspase-Glo assay kit. TRAIL-resistant cells were generated by culture of RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 by acute exposure to TRAIL followed by selection of TRAIL-resistant cells. RESULTS: TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in OPM-2, RPMI 8226, NCI-H929, U266, JJN-3 MM cell lines and ADC-1 plasma cell leukaemia cells. SAHA amplified TRAIL responses in all lines except OPM-2, and enhanced TRAIL responses were both via Caspase-8 and -9. SAHA treatment induced growth inhibition that further increased in the combination treatment with TRAIL in MM cells. The co-treatment of TRAIL and SAHA reduced viable cell numbers all cell lines. TRAIL responses were further potentiated by SAHA in 3D cell culture in NCI-H929, RPMI 8226 and U266 at lower TRAIL + SAHA doses than in suspension culture. However TRAIL responses in cells that had been selected for TRAIL resistance were not further enhanced by SAHA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SAHA is a potent sensitizer of TRAIL responses in both TRAIL sensitive and resistant cell lines, in both suspension and 3D culture, however SAHA did not sensitise TRAIL-sensitive cell populations that had been selected for TRAIL-resistance from initially TRAIL-sensitive populations. SAHA may increase TRAIL sensitivity in insensitive cells, but not in cells that have specifically been selected for acquired TRAIL-resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated the induction of apoptosis by esculetin in NB4 human leukemia cells, as a model, by a mechanism not well understood. To analyse the antioxidant activity of esculetin on apoptosis, we have studied the influence of co-treatments of esculetin at a concentration of 100muM with exogenous ROS donors, namely tert-butyl-hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide, on NB4 cells. Esculetin (100muM) exerts a protective effect on cell viability and death necrosis or late apoptosis caused by the oxidant t-BHP whereas it potentiates decrease of cell viability and cell death caused by H2O2. In the first case, the O2(-) scavenging activity of esculetin (100muM) could be implicated. In the last one, cytotoxicity by apoptosis induction seems to be related to the increase in O2(-), among other possible mechanisms. These results contribute to the study of the antitumor properties of esculetin by regulation of redox balance in leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In recent and interesting contributions to the debate it has been argued that the challenges with the concept of disease can be resolved by a prototype concept of disease. As a robin is a more prototypical of a bird than a penguin, some diseases are more prototypical than others. If disease is a prototype concept, it would change nosology, but also health care and the study of health and disease. However, the statement that ""disease is a prototype concept"" forms an empirically testable hypothesis. Therefore, this study aims to test the hypothesis that health professionals have a prototype concept of disease. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-three health care professionals in Norway were invited to participate in a survey where they were asked to rank a wide range of diseases according to how typical they considered them to be as diseases. Results were analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The response rate was 90%. Lung cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, myocardial infarction, and AIDS are the diseases ranged to be most typical, while homosexuality, pregnancy, drapetomania, dissidence, and nostalgia are considered to be the least typical diseases. The results also show that the answers to how typical various diseases are vary greatly, even amongst a relatively homogenous group of health professionals. CONCLUSION: This study falsifies the hypothesis that disease is a prototype concept for health professionals. This has implications for the debate on core concepts for health care. If health professionals do not have a prototype concept of disease, it is unlikely that there is a prototype concept of disease in general. Consequently, nosologies should not be based on prototypes.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Concept', '*Disease', '*Falsification', '*Language', '*Prototype']",PMC5592715,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 10.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sex chromosome loss (SCL) can occur in older men as a physiological phenomenon or as an acquired abnormality in leukemia. Loss of chromosome Y and loss of chromosome X are acquired disorders that are mainly observed in patients over 80 years as well as in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. In this review, we examine the cytogenetic and molecular changes of sex chromosomes in leukemia. METHODS: Relevant English language literature were searched and retrieved from PubMed search engine (1990-2016). The following keywords were used: 'Sex chromosomes', 'Leukemia' and 'Cytogenetics'. RESULTS: The loss of tumor suppressor genes along with these chromosomal abnormalities in the majority of malignant cells in bone marrow (BM) has raised the question whether this is an age-related phenomenon or has occurred as a result of clonal abnormality. On the other hand, the presence of these chromosomal abnormalities in a number of genetic diseases associated with leukemia leads to progression of malignancy, and their role in peripheral blood stem cell transplantation confirm the finding that these chromosomal abnormalities can play an important role in clonal abnormality. CONCLUSION: The presence of these abnormalities can cause genetic instability in BM and result in the development of a malignant clone and progression of the disease. In addition, the evaluation of SCL together with the genes involved in these chromosomes can contribute to predict the disease prognosis as well as monitoring of malignancy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Sex chromosomes', 'cytogenetics', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we reprogrammed rbiPSCs using human Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) 2 and 4 and cultured them in a medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and leukemia inhibitory factor. These cells (designated rbEKA) were propagated by enzymatic dissociation for at least 30 passages, during which they maintained a normal karyotype. This new culturing protocol resulted in transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration, as substantiated by the expression of transcription factors and the presence of histone modifications associated with naive pluripotency. Furthermore, microarray analysis of rbiPSCs, rbEKA cells, rabbit ICM cells, and rabbit epiblast showed that the global gene expression profile of the reprogrammed rbiPSCs was more similar to that of rabbit ICM and epiblast cells. Injection of rbEKA cells into 8-cell stage rabbit embryos resulted in extensive colonization of ICM in 9% early-blastocysts (E3.5), epiblast in 10% mid-blastocysts (E4.5), and embryonic disk in 1.4% pre-gastrulae (E6). Thus, these results indicate that KLF2 and KLF4 triggered the conversion of rbiPSCs into epiblast-like, embryo colonization-competent PSCs.

We recruited a cohort of 22 CLL patients with i(17q) and described their biological characteristics, mutational status of the genes TP53 and IGHV and genomic complexity. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of the type of cytogenetic anomaly bearing the TP53 defect on the outcome of CLL patients and compared the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of i(17q) cases with those of a group of 38 CLL patients harboring other 17p aberrations. We detected IGHV somatic hypermutation in all assessed patients, and TP53 mutations were observed in 71.4% of the cases. Patients with i(17q) were more commonly associated with complex karyotypes (CK) and tended to have a poorer OS than patients with other anomalies affecting 17p13 (median OS, 44 vs 120 months, P = 0.084). Regarding chromosomal alterations, significant differences in the median OS were found among groups (P = 0.044).

The polyphenols present in the Pelargonium graveolens extract are mainly responsible for reduction and subsequent stabilization of formed PdNPs. UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) absorption and reaction color change from yellow to brown indicated the formation of PdNPs. The as synthesized PdNPs were studied by using characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta potential measurements and Selected area electron diffraction (SAED). FTIR analysis and Zeta potential measurements showed the capping of polyphenols onto the surface of PdNPs, which further responsible for preventing aggregation of PdNPs. TEM image showed that the PdNPs exists in the range from 50 to 150nm. Also, XRD pattern revealed the crystalline nature of as synthesized PdNPs. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies of Pelargonium graveolens extract capped PdNPs was conducted using human leukemia cell lines (K562) by following an MTT cell viability assay and is found that the cytotoxicity is dose dependent. Further, the synthesized PdNPs will open a new opportunities in the field of biomedicine.

CD4(+)T cells are the main target of HTLV-1, but other cell types are known to be infected, including immature lymphocytes. Developing T cells undergo differentiation in the thymus, through migration and interaction with the thymic microenvironment, in particular with thymic epithelial cells (TEC) the major component of this three dimensional meshwork of non-lymphoid cells. Herein, we show that TEC express the receptors for HTLV-1 and can be infected by this virus through cell-cell contact and by cell-free virus suspensions. The expression of anti-apoptosis, chemokine and adhesion molecules genes are altered in HTLV-1-infected TEC, although gene expression of antigen presentation molecules remained unchanged. Furthermore, HTLV-1-infected TEC transmitted the virus to a CD4(+) T cell line and to CD4(+) T cells from healthy donors, during in vitro cellular co-cultures. Altogether, our data point to the possibility that the human thymic epithelial cells play a role in the establishment and progression of HTLV-1 infection, functioning as a reservoir and transmitting the virus to maturing CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which in turn will cause disease in the periphery.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

There was considerable inter-study heterogeneity in which instruments were used, and many studies employed multiple (often overlapping) instruments. Longitudinal studies in particular suffered from both high attrition rates due to disease-related mortality as well as waning compliance with questionnaire completion.

Here, we discuss advances in several areas of human NK cell research, many of which support the ability of NK cells to prevent cancer development and avoid relapse following adoptive immunotherapy. We describe the molecular basis for NK cell recognition of human tumor cells and provide evidence for NK cell-mediated killing of human primary tumor cells ex vivo. Subsequently, we highlight studies demonstrating the ability of NK cells to migrate to, and reside in, the human tumor microenvironment where selection of tumor escape variants from NK cells can occur. Indirect evidence for NK cell immunosurveillance against human malignancies is provided by the reduced incidence of cancer in individuals with high levels of NK cell cytotoxicity, and the significant clinical responses observed following infusion of human NK cells into cancer patients. Finally, we describe studies showing enhanced tumor progression, or increased cancer incidence, in patients with inherited and acquired defects in cellular cytotoxicity. All these observations have in common that they, either indirectly or directly, suggest a role for NK cells in mediating immunosurveillance against human cancer. This opens up for exciting possibilities with respect to further exploring NK cells in settings of adoptive immunotherapy in human cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) constitute the frontline treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, was developed to overcome TKI resistances. However, dasatinib resistances are also described but remain less characterized. To mimic in vivo acquired dasatinib resistance, the BCR-ABL1-positive cell line K562 was transiently treated with a pharmacological concentration of dasatinib, for a short time in the presence of stem cell factor. A dasatinib resistant counterpart (K562 RES) was developed. Investigation of resistance mechanisms using kinase substrate arrays revealed that FYN was overactivated in K562 RES. The FYN inhibitor KX2-391 cooperated with dasatinib to block K562 RES proliferation. Cell tracking experiments showed that activated FYN support cell proliferation independently of BCR-ABL1 in K562 RES cells. Moreover, the MEK-ERK pathway was found hyper-phosphorylated in K562 RES cells even in the presence of dasatinib. Actually, ERK1/2 activity supported viability in K562 RES only in the absence of BCR-ABL1 activity. Finally, BCR-ABL1 and MEK inhibitor combination was sufficient to induce cell death even in non-proliferating resistant cells. Considering the conditions used to generate this dasatinib resistant cell line, such a resistance mechanism could be found in dasatinib treated patients. Consequently, it is valuable to know that inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 axis can overcome this resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Oct 31.,"BACKGROUND: CD19-targeted chimeric-antigen receptor-modified T-cells (CAR-T) are promising in the treatment of refractory B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by multicolor flow cytometry (FCM) is critical to distinguish B-ALL MRD from regenerating, non-neoplastic B-cell populations. METHODS: FCM was performed on samples from 9 patients with B-ALL treated with CAR-T. RESULTS: All 9 patients showed response to CAR-T. Additionally, FCM revealed circulating CD10 + B cells, potentially mimicking MRD. Circulating CD10+ B-cells were detected in blood from 3 days to 3 months after CAR-T, comprising 73% (median) of B-cells (52-83%, 95%CI). They expressed CD19, CD10, CD20, bright CD9, CD22, CD24, moderate CD38 and dim CD58, but were CD34 (-), with bright CD45 and polyclonal surface light chain immunoglobulin (sIg) expression. A similar CD10 + B-cell subpopulation was detected by marrow FCM, amidst abundant B-cell precursors. CONCLUSIONS: These circulating CD10 + B-cells are compatible with immature B-cells, and are a reflection of B-cell recovery within the marrow. They are immunophenotypically distinguishable from residual B-ALL. Expression of light chain sIg and key surface antigens characterizing regenerating B-cell precursors can distinguish immature B-cells from B-ALL MRD and prevent misdiagnosis.

Epub 2017 Jul 31.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignacies are still a major public concern worldwide and despite the intensive search of new chemotherapeutic agents, treatment still remains a challenging issue. The present study was designed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of 2-acetyl-7-methoxynaphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-quinone (AMNQ) isolated from the bark of Milletia versicolor towards a panel of drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of AMNQ against 9 drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species were all analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following resazurin assay, the naphthoquinone AMNQ displayed IC50 values ranging from 0.79microM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) to 3.26microM (against MDA-MB231/BCRP breast cancer cells) on 9 tested cancer cell lines, whilst doxorubicin showed IC50 values ranging from 0.40microM (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 91.37microM (against CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells). IC50 values below 1microM were recorded with AMNQ towards CCRF-CEM cells (0.57microM), U87MG.DeltaEGFR gliobastoma multiforme cells (0.96microM cells) and HepG2 cells (0.76microM). Compared to its corresponding sensitive cell lines U87MG, sensitivity was observed in epidermal growth factor receptor-transfected U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells to AMNQ. MMP was found to be the main mode of action of induction of apoptosis by AMNQ. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work demonstrate the cytotoxicity of AMNQ towards various types of cancer cell lines, including MDR phenotypes. AMNQ is a potential antiproliferative natural compound that deserves more investigations to develop novel cytotoxic drugs against sensitive and MDR cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Specifically, the role of salts in promoting specific PMIs and their competition among various metals has remained untapped mainly due to the difficulty to distinguish nonspecific PMIs from specific PMIs by classic spectroscopic techniques. Herein, we report Hofmeister salts differentially promote the specific PMIs by combining nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence measurement and circular dichroism). Furthermore, to explore the influence of salts in competitive binding between metalloproteins and various metals, we designed a series of competitive experiments and applied to a well-defined model system, the competitive binding of zinc (II) and arsenic (III) to holo-promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). These experiments not only provided new insights at the molecular scale as complementary to previous NMR and spectroscopic results, but also deduced the relative binding ability between zinc finger proteins and metals at the molecular scale, which avoids the mass spectrometric titration-based determination of binding constants that is frequently affected and often degraded by variable solution conditions including salt contents.

An increased understanding of how this is achieved is critical for identifying or improving therapeutic interventions. In this study, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) human cell lines and a custom CRISPR/Cas9 screening platform, we identify the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 as a novel, negative regulator of innate immunity. SETDB1 is overexpressed in many cancers, and loss of this gene in AML cells triggers desilencing of retrotransposable elements that leads to the production of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This is coincident with induction of a type I interferon response and apoptosis through the dsRNA-sensing pathway.

METHODS: 41 Uruguayan patients were recruited. Gene polymorphisms involved in MTX pathway were analyzed and their association with treatment toxicities and outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: Genotype distribution and allele frequency were determined for SLC19A1 G80A, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, TYMS 28bp copy number variation, SLCO1B1 T521C, DHFR C-1610G/T, DHFR C-680A, DHFR A-317G and DHFR 19bp indel. Multivariate analysis showed that DHFR-1610G/T (OR=0.107, p=0.018) and MTHFR677T alleles (OR=0.12, p=0.026) had a strong protective effect against hematologic toxicity, while DHFR-1610CC genotype increased this toxicity (OR=9, p=0.045). No more associations were found. CONCLUSIONS: The associations found between gene polymorphisms and toxicities in this small cohort are encouraging for a more extensive research to gain a better dose individualization in adult ALL and NHL patients. Besides, genotype distribution showed to be different from other populations, reinforcing the idea that genotype data from other populations should not be extrapolated to ours.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Sep 5.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. ALL arises from the malignant transformation of progenitor B- and T-cells in the bone marrow into leukemic cells, but the mechanisms underlying this transformation are not well understood. Recent technical advances and decreasing costs of methods for high-throughput DNA sequencing and SNP genotyping have stimulated systematic studies of the epigenetic changes in leukemic cells from pediatric ALL patients. The results emerging from these studies are increasing our understanding of the epigenetic component of leukemogenesis and have demonstrated the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker for lineage and subtype classification, prognostication, and disease progression in ALL. In this review, we provide a concise examination of the epigenetic studies in ALL, with a focus on DNA methylation and mutations perturbing genes involved in chromatin modification, and discuss the future role of epigenetic analyses in research and clinical management of ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Aug 26.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for approximately 25% of childhood cancer cases. As a result of effective treatments over the past decades, paediatric ALL mortality has been greatly reduced. Chemotherapy, however, has a range of harmful side effects including the loss of protective antibodies against vaccine-preventable diseases. Since ALL survivors have an increased risk of health problems including organ insufficiencies, acquired vaccine-preventable infections subsequent to clinical remission could become life threatening to these individuals. This review will summarize clinical findings regarding defective humoral immunity in ALL survivors, identify current knowledge gaps and highlight mechanisms related to deficiencies in the B-cell compartment important for serological memory. Further, we illuminate the emerging evidence for a relationship between chemotherapy and gut microbiota, which could play an important role in vaccine responses and the shaping of a young immune system subjected to maturation and recovery.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Aug 25.,"In the recent update of WHO classification, the definition of myeloid neoplasms with erythroid predominance has been modified shifting the main criteria for calculating blast percentage from non-erythroid cells (NEC) to all nucleated marrow cells (ANC). Thus, the cases previously classified as erythroid/myeloid subtype of acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) based on the 2008 WHO will now be categorized either as myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts (MDS-EB) or acute myeloid leukemia, not otherwise specified (AML-NOS). However, the clinical significance of this new classification has not been demonstrated. Thus, we reviewed a leukemia database and reclassified 38 cases previously diagnosed as AEL, erythroid/myeloid subtype, with the consideration of 2016 revision criteria. Twenty seven (71%) of them had >20% blasts in NEC but less than 20% blasts in ANC, and 11 (29%) had >20% in both NEC and ANC. There was no significant difference in overall survivals (OS) among AEL, MDS-EB, and AML-NOS (non-erythroid predominance, NEP). However, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes showed significant shorter OS than AEL, MDS-EB and AML-NOS (NEP). Our results indicate that in myeloid neoplasm with erythroid predominance, patients with >20% blasts, of either NEC or ANC, share similar clinical laboratory features and survival outcomes with AML-NOS.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Several gene mutations are involved in the onset of this disease and resistance to therapy. The present study examines the incidence of IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, EBF1, ETV6, BTG1, RB1, JAK2, and Xp22.33 gene deletions/duplications associated with pediatric ALL in Iran and investigates the possible effect of these mutations on drug resistance. Three-year disease-free survival (3DFS) was evaluated for children diagnosed with Philadelphia negative precursor-B-cell ALL hospitalized at Sayed-al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan-Iran, from January 2009 until December 2012. DNA was extracted from bone marrow slides, and ALL correlated gene deletions and duplications were measured using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method. The correlation between gene mutations and 3DFS was then assessed. Among the nine aforementioned investigated genes, 63% of samples showed at least one gene mutation. At least two concomitant genomic mutations were observed in 42% of samples. Pax5 deletion was the most prevalent gene mutation observed in 45% of cases, and showed significant negative impact on response to treatment. CDKN2A/B (9p21.3) gene deletion, and ETV6 (12p13.2) gene duplication also demonstrated negative effect on patient survival and contributed to a worse prognosis if concomitant with Pax5 gene deletion. ALL patients with one of the gene deletions including Pax5 and CDKN2A/B (9p21.3) or ETV6 (12p13.2) gene duplication are classified as high-risk patients and need more intensified protocols of treatment to improve their chance of survival.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'CDKN2A/B gene deletion', 'Disease free survival.', 'ETV6 gene duplication', 'Pax5 gene deletion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous involvement by CMML is critical to recognize as it typically is a harbinger of disease progression and an increased incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Cutaneous lesions of CMML exhibit heterogeneous histopathologic features that can be challenging to recognize as CMML. We describe a 67-year-old man with a 3-year history of CMML who had been managed on single-agent azacitidine with stable disease before developing splenomegaly and acute onset skin lesions. Examination of these skin lesions revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytic cells morphologically resembling Langerhans type cells (lacking frank histopathologic atypia), and with the immunophenotype of an indeterminate cell histiocytosis (S100+ CD1a+ and langerin-). Given the history of CMML, next-generation sequencing studies were performed on the skin biopsy. These revealed a KRAS (p.G12R) mutation identical to that seen in the CMML 3 years prior, establishing a clonal relationship between the 2 processes. This case expands the spectrum for and underscores the protean nature of cutaneous involvement by CMML and underscores the importance of heightened vigilance when evaluating skin lesions of CMML patients.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Some cases of HES are caused by the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene and respond to imatinib. FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive HES occasionally evolves into chronic eosinophilic leukemia or into another form of myeloproliferative neoplasm; however, the development of a malignant lymphoma is very rare. We present a rare case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and HES with the FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene rearrangement. PATIENT CONCERNS: A man in his 30s presented to our hospital with fever, hypereosinophilia, widespread lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed hypereosinophilia, increased soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and increased vitamin B12. Positron-emission tomography with F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed positive FDG uptake in multiple enlarged lymph nodes throughout the body and the red bone marrow. A bone-marrow biopsy showed hypereosinophilia without dysplasia and an increased number of blasts. The FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene was positive upon fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the peripheral blood. Furthermore, biopsy of a lymph node from the neck revealed restiform hyperplasia of capillary vessels, with small lymphoma cells arranged around the capillaries. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD3, CD4, and CD10, and negative for CD20. Lymphoma cells were also positive for the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene by FISH analysis. DIAGNOSES: From these findings, the patient was diagnosed with HES and AITL with FIP1L1/PDGFRA. INTERVENTIONS: After the diagnosis, corticosteroid was administered but was ineffective. Imatinib was then administered. OUTCOMES: Imatinib was very effective for treating HES and AITL, and complete remission was achieved in both. LESSONS: This report presents the first case in which the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene was positive both in peripheral blood and lymph nodes, implying the possibility that the tumor cells acquired the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene in the early stage of hematopoietic progenitor cell developments. Imatinib was very effective in treating both HES and lymphoma, suggesting that the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both HES and lymphoma.",,,,PMC6392760,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can occur de novo or concurrently with hematological disorders, usually acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML chemotherapy is generally the initial therapy for MS and LC, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be considered as additional therapy. However, treatment for older patients who are unable to continue intensive chemotherapy is not currently standardized. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with multiple MSs associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), using bone marrow aspiration and lymph node biopsy. DIAGNOSES: Additionally, LC was diagnosed by skin biopsy. Extramedullary MS and LC lesions were formed by massive infiltration of myeloblastic cells. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty courses of 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) were administrated as maintenance therapy after induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine. OUTCOMES: Myeloblasts decreased in the bone marrow and the LC disappeared after induction therapy. The MSs completely disappeared, except for the palatine tonsil lesion, after 5-Aza maintenance therapy. 5-Aza treatment provided long-term partial response for more than 21 months. LESSONS: 5-Aza was well tolerated and may be a good option for the treatment of MS and LC associated with MDS, especially in older patients who cannot receive HSCT.",,,,PMC6392782,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the role of GC7 and eif5a-2 in drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present study, we investigated the effect of GC7 on drug-resistant ALL and its potential mechanism. We found that using the CCK-8 assay that combined treatment with GC7 and vincristine (VCR) significantly inhibited the cell viability of two ALL cell lines. Using EdU incorporation assays and flow cytometry, we also showed that GC7 could markedly enhance the VCR sensitivity of ALL cells by suppressing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that GC7 could downregulate eif5a-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression. Knockdown of eif5a-2 inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and significantly enhanced the VCR sensitivity. Moreover, eif5a-2 knockdown decreased the regulatory role of GC7 in increasing VCR sensitivity. Thus, our findings indicate that combined treatment with GC7 could enhance VCR sensitivity of ALL cells by regulating the eif5a-2/Mcl-1 axis. Together, our results highlight the potential clinical application of GC7 in VCR-based chemotherapy for the treatment of ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little studies revealed the role or clinical implication of miR-216b in blood cancers. Herein, we reported miR-216b expression and its clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the current study, we analyzed bone marrow (BM) miR-216b expression in 115 de novo AML patients examined by real-time quantitative PCR. Notably, BM miR-216b expression was significantly up-regulated in AML patients, and could serve as a potential biomarker distinguishing AML from controls. No significant correlations of BM miR-216 expression were found with sex, age, white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, BM blasts, French-American-British classifications, and karyotypes. Significantly, patients with high miR-216b expression tended to have a lower frequency of FLT3-ITD mutation and higher incidence of U2AF1 and IDH1/2 mutations. Moreover, complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival were negatively affected by BM miR-216b overexpression among cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Cox regression analyses showed that high BM miR-216b expression may act as an independent risk factor in CN-AML patients. Among the follow-up patients, BM miR-216b level in CR phase was markedly lower than in diagnosis time, and was returned in relapse phase. Collectively, our findings indicated that miR-216b overexpression was a frequent event in de novo AML, and independently conferred a poor prognosis in CN-AML. Moreover, miR-216b expression was a valuable biomarker correlated with disease recurrence in AML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*expression', '*miR-216b', '*prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"OBJECTIVE: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have a supportive role in hematopoiesis and as components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may present alterations during acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and be affected by chemotherapeutic agents. We examined the biological and functional characteristics of MSCs in ALL diagnosis and treatment and their effect on MSC qualitative properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunophenotypic characterization, evaluation of clonogenicity, and proliferative capacity were measured. Apoptotic features, cell-cycle analysis, and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha and angiopoietin-1 levels in MSC supernatant at diagnosis and in different phases of treatment were assessed. Chemotherapy was administered according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-2000 protocol. BM samples from children with solid tumors without BM involvement were used as the control group. RESULTS: The morphology, the immunophenotypic profile, and the apoptotic characteristics of the MSCs were not affected by leukemia. The secretion of factors involved in the trafficking of hematopoietic cells in the BM seems to be upregulated at diagnosis in comparison to the treatment phases. MSCs are influenced by the disease in terms of their functional characteristics such as clonogenicity and proliferation rate. These effects cease as soon as treatment is initiated. Chemotherapy does not seem to exert any effect on any of the MSC features examined. CONCLUSION: MSCs from children with ALL are affected by their interaction with the leukemic environment, but this phenomenon ceases upon treatment initiation, while no effect is observed by chemotherapy itself.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Childhood leukemia', 'Mesenchymal stromal cells Stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha.']",PMC5843770,,,,,,Cocukluk Cagi Akut Lenfoblastik Losemisinde Kemik Iligi Mezenkimal Stroma Hucrelerinin Biyolojik Ozellikleri.,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"Objective: Traditional prognostic factors have proved insufficient to account for heterogeneity in the clinical behavior of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Cryptochrome-1 (CRY-1) is a circadian clock gene essential in maintaining the circadian rhythm and regulating cell proliferation. We evaluated CRY-1 gene expression in CLL and addressed its putative role as a prognostic indicator for the clinical course of CLL. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 CLL patients at diagnosis were studied for CRY-1 gene expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and were followed for assessment of time to first treatment (TFT). Results: CRY-1 was expressed in 94% of the CLL patients at diagnosis. The median CRY-1 relative gene expression level (0.006) stratified patients into high and low expression groups. Forty of 100 (40%) CLL patients showed high CRY-1, 54/100 (54%) showed low CRY-1, and 6/100 (6%) had undetectable CRY-1 gene expression. High CRY-1 gene expression was concordant with CD38(+), Zap-70(+), and double CD38(+)Zap-70(+) expression; unfavorable/intermediate cytogenetics; unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene; and diffuse marrow infiltration. The high CRY-1 gene expression patient group exhibited shorter TFT than the patients with low CRY-1 gene expression. A Cox proportional hazard regression model identified CRY-1 gene expression to be independently predictive for TFT. Conclusion: CRY-1 is differentially expressed among CLL patients, stratifying them into low-risk and high-risk groups. CRY-1 gene expression could constitute a reliable prognostic indicator for CLL progression, complementing the role of standard well-established prognostic factors. CRY-1 gene expression could be employed as a prognostic indicator for disease progression during the initial prognostic work-up and follow-up for CLL patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Cryptochrome-1', '*Circadian genes', '*Time to first treatment', '*Prognosis', '*Real-time polymerase chain reaction', '*CD38', '*Zap-70']",PMC6110451,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,"We recently reported an unconventional mechanism by which miRNAs inhibit HIV-1 viral production. This occurs when miRNAs bind nonspecifically to the viral structural protein Gag, interfering with viral RNA-mediated Gag assembly at the plasma membrane. Consequently, misassembled viral complexes are redirected into the endocytic pathway where they are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is a critical mediator of the viral degradation pathway and that this pathway is not HIV-1 specific. Misassembled viral complexes were found to colocalize extensively with LC3 and p62 in late endosomes/lysosomes, demonstrating a convergence of autophagy with functional degradative compartments. Knocking down autophagosome formation machineries reduced this convergence, while treatment with autophagy-inducer rapamycin enhanced the convergence. Furthermore, similar autophagy-dependent nonspecific miRNA inhibition of murine leukemia virus (MLV) assembly was shown. Overall, these results reveal autophagy as a crucial regulator of the retroviral degradation pathway in host cells initiated by nonspecific miRNA-Gag interactions. These findings could have significant implications for understanding how cells may regulate retroviral complex assembly by miRNA expression and autophagy, and raise the possibility that similar regulations can occur in other biological contexts.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag protein', '*autophagy', '*microRNA']",PMC6019656,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activating kinase mutations in KIT, FLT3, and N-RAS have been frequently found, and their cooperation with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 is thought to be crucial for leukemogenesis in CBF-AML. Recently, mutations in ASXL2, ZBTB7A, CCND2, and DHX15 have been frequently identified in t (8;21) AML, but their biological and clinical significance have not been elucidated. Thus, a combination of several genetic alterations is associated with the development of CBF-AML, and comprehensive genetic analysis is necessary for the stratification of this leukemia.

Recently, we demonstrated a unique genetic mechanism of immune escape caused by structural variations (SVs) commonly disrupting the 3' part of the PD-L1 gene. These SVs invariably cause a marked elevation of aberrant PD-L1 transcripts that are stabilized by truncation of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), and thereby widely affect multiple common cancer types, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (27%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8%), and adenocarcinoma of the stomach (2%). All SVs invariably result in a prominent increase of aberrant PD-L1 transcripts commonly lacking an intact 3'-UTR, which most typically generate gene fusions with ectopic sequences including integrated viral genomes.

Until recently, this procedure was generally limited to those recipients who had an available matched-sibling donor or matched-unrelated donor. Technical advances in graft cell processing and manipulation, control of bidirectional T cell alloreactivity, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and other supportive measures in haploidentical transplantation now enable nearly all patients with acute myeloid leukemia to benefit from the graft-versus-leukemia effect with substantial reduction in procedure-related mortality. Over recent years, haploidentical donors have been increasingly adopted as a valid donor source in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia in the absence of an HLA-matched donor. Among centers of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the use of haploidentical related donor transplantation has increased by 250% since 2010, and 291% since 2005. On behalf of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we summarize recent utilization trends in haploidentical transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and describe the transformative changes in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation techniques over the past decade, which have led to the current widespread use of this procedure. Furthermore, we review the efficacy of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia from available studies, including preliminary comparative studies, and bring attention to remaining unanswered questions and directions for future research.

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,"The immunomodulatory role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been extensively investigated. To this end, we genotyped 509 10/10 HLA unrelated transplant pairs for HLA-E, in order to study the effect of HLA-E as a natural killer (NK)-alloreactivity mediator on HSCT outcome in an acute leukemia (AL) setting. Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were set as endpoints. Analysis of our data revealed a significant correlation between HLA-E mismatch and improved HSCT outcome, as shown by both univariate (53% vs 38%, P=0.002, 5-year OS) and multivariate (hazard ratio (HR)=0.63, confidence interval (CI) 95%=0.48-0.83, P=0.001) analyses. Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that the positive effect of HLA-E mismatch was significant and pronounced in advanced disease patients (n=120) (5-year OS: 50% vs 18%, P=0.005; HR=0.40, CI 95%=0.22-0.72, P=0.002; results from univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). The study herein is the first to report an association between HLA-E incompatibility and improved post-transplant prognosis in AL patients who have undergone matched unrelated HSCT. Combined NK and T cell HLA-E-mediated mechanisms may account for the better outcomes observed. Notwithstanding the necessity for in vitro and confirmational studies, our findings highlight the clinical relevance of HLA-E matching and strongly support prospective HLA-E screening upon donor selection for matched AL unrelated HSCTs.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5664399,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modifications of critical proteins through reactive metabolites are thought to be responsible for a number of adverse drug reactions. In vitro metabolite screening of ponatinib with human liver microsomes and glutathione revealed unambiguous signals of ponatinib-glutathione (P-GSH) adducts. Further profiling of human cytochrome P450 (P450) indicated that CYP1A1 was the predominant P450 enzyme driving this reaction. P-GSH conjugate formation paralleled the disappearance of hydroxylated ponatinib metabolites, suggesting the initial reaction was epoxide generation. Mouse glutathione S-transferase p1 (mGstp1) further enhanced P-GSH adduct formation in vitro. Ponatinib pharmacokinetics were determined in vivo in wild-type (WT) mice and mice humanized for CYP1A1/2 and treated with the CYP1A1 inducers 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin or 3-methylcholanthrene. Ponatinib exposure was significantly decreased in treated mice compared with controls (7.7- and 2.2-fold for WT and humanized CYP1A1/2, respectively). Interestingly, the P-GSH conjugate was only found in the feces of CYP1A1-induced mice, but not in control animals. Protein adducts were also identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of mGstp1 tryptic digests. These results indicate that not only could CYP1A1 be involved in ponatinib disposition, which has not been previously reported, but also that electrophilic intermediates resulting from CYP1A1 metabolism in normal tissues may contribute to ponatinib toxicity. These data are consistent with a recent report that CML patients who smoke are at greater risk of disease progression and premature death.",['Copyright (c) 2017 by The Author(s).'],,,PMC5596814,['10822/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,"During hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a substantial number of donor cells are lost because of apoptotic cell death. Transplantation-associated apoptosis is mediated mainly by the proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BIM and BMF, and their proapoptotic function is conserved between mouse and human stem and progenitor cells. Permanent inhibition of apoptosis in donor cells caused by the loss of these BH3-only proteins improves transplantation outcome, but recipients might be exposed to increased risk of lymphomagenesis or autoimmunity. Here, we address whether transient inhibition of apoptosis can serve as a safe but efficient alternative to improve the outcome of stem cell transplantation. We show that transient apoptosis inhibition by short-term overexpression of prosurvival BCL-XL, known to block BIM and BMF, is not only sufficient to increase the viability of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during engraftment but also improves transplantation outcome without signs of adverse pathologies. Hence, this strategy represents a promising and novel therapeutic approach, particularly under conditions of limited donor stem cell availability.",['(c) 2017 Kollek et al.'],,,PMC5626392,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have highlighted cellular and non-cellular components of the tissue microenvironment in CLL that help nurture the growth of leukemic cells by providing the necessary stimuli for their proliferation and survival. The diverse stimuli in the specialized tissue microenvironment of CLL lead to constitutive activation of several signaling pathways that includes B cell receptor signaling and the associated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Recent findings have described aberrant activation of MAPK signaling and its interactions with other cellular signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of CLL. These studies have shed light on the deregulated molecular mechanisms contributing to hyperactivation of MAPK signaling and provided avenues for therapeutic options for aggressive CLL. In this review, we describe and discuss the current status of our understanding into the role of MAPK signaling in the pathogenesis of CLL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR signaling', '*MAPK signaling', '*Word', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 4.,"Purpose: Mercaptopurine (MP) is one of the main chemotherapeutics for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To improve treatment outcomes, constant MP dose titration is essential to maintain steady drug exposure, while minimizing myelosuppression. We performed two-stage analyses to identify genetic determinants of MP-related neutropenia in Korean pediatric ALL patients. Materials and Methods: Targeted sequencing of 40 patients who exhibited definite MP intolerance was conducted using a novel panel of 211 pharmacogenetic-related genes, and subsequent analysis was performed with 185 patients. Results: Using bioinformatics tools and genetic data, four functionally interesting variants were selected (ABCC4, APEX1, CYP1A1, and CYP4F2). Including four variants, 23 variants in 12 genes potentially linked to MP adverse reactions were selected as final candidates for subsequent analysis in 185 patients. Ultimately, a variant allele in APEX1 rs2307486was found to be strongly associated with MP-induced neutropenia that occurred within 28 days of initiating MP (odds ratio, 3.44; p=0.02). Moreover, the cumulative incidence of MP-related neutropenia was significantly higher in patients with APEX1 rs2307486 variants, as GG genotypes were associated with the highest cumulative incidence (p &lt; 0.01). NUDT15 rs116855232 variants were strongly associated with a higher cumulative incidence of neutropenia (p &lt; 0.01), and a lower median dose of tolerated MP throughout maintenance treatment (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: We have identified that APEX1 rs2307486 variants conferred an increased risk of MP-related early onset neutropenia. APEX1 and NUDT15 both contribute to cell protection from DNA damage or misincorporation, so alleles that impair the function of either gene may affect MP sensitivities, thereby inducing MP-related neutropenia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['6-Mercaptopurine', 'APEX1', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Neutropenia', 'Pediatrics', 'NUDT15']",PMC6056975,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, reconstructing this tree is challenging as most cancer sequencing uses bulk tumor tissue containing heterogeneous mixtures of cells. Results: We introduce P robabilistic A lgorithm for S omatic Tr ee I nference (PASTRI), a new algorithm for bulk-tumor sequencing data that clusters somatic mutations into clones and infers a phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary history of the tumor. PASTRI uses an importance sampling algorithm that combines a probabilistic model of DNA sequencing data with a enumeration algorithm based on the combinatorial constraints defined by the underlying phylogenetic tree. As a result, tree inference is fast, accurate and robust to noise. We demonstrate on simulated data that PASTRI outperforms other cancer phylogeny algorithms in terms of runtime and accuracy. On real data from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient, we show that a simple linear phylogeny better explains the data the complex branching phylogeny that was previously reported. PASTRI provides a robust approach for phylogenetic tree inference from mixed samples. Availability and Implementation: Software is available at compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.

Furthermore, the role of HLI infusion was explored in a mouse model. The clinical trial included 29 elderly patients (median age: 64, range 57-77) with AML. Sixteen cases achieved complete remission (CR) and 9 cases achieved partial remission (PR) after the first treatment cycle. Of the patients with PR, 5 subjects achieved remission after the second induction, which brings the overall CR rate to 72.4%. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 59.6% and 36.9% respectively. The treatment regimen was well tolerated with only one patient died of severe pneumonia one month after the first treatment. In the mouse experiment, we found that DAC/HLI significantly enhanced the survival of leukemic mice.

However, neither the amount of genomic 5-hmc in ATLL tumor cells nor TET2 expression has been studied yet. In this study, we analyzed these two parameters as well as the mutational status of TET2 in ATLL patients. By employing a direct in situ approach, we documented that tumor T cells infiltrating lymph nodes exhibit low level of 5-hmc compared to residual normal T cells. Furthermore, this 5-hmc defect was more pronounced in tumor T cells from acute patients than from chronic ones and correlated with reduced expression of TET2 protein. TET2 variations were found in 14 patients (20%), including 13 with aggressive forms. Strikingly, 9 of the 14 patients showed the same variation (SNP rs72963007), whose frequency in ATLL patients was significantly higher than that of an ethnically matched control population (13% vs. 5%). However, no reduction of 5-hmc was found in PBMC from individuals possessing the variant rs72963007 TET2 allele, as compared to wild-type individuals. In contrast, a robust correlation was observed between 5-hmc and the levels of TET2 mRNA. Finally, loss of 5-hmc and TET2 downregulation both correlated with poor survival. These findings demonstrate that ATLL progression coincides with loss of genomic 5-hmc and indicate that downregulation of TET2, rather than TET2 mutations, is the key mechanism involved in 5-hmc modulation during ATLL progression.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA hydroxymethylation', 'T-cells', 'leukemia', 'retrovirus', 'ten eleven translocation']",PMC5581026,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

This pro-survival activity is known to involve soluble factors, but few data are available on the relative role of cells cross-talk. Here, we used a transcriptome-based approach to systematically investigate the expression of various receptor/ligand pairs at the surface of NLC/CLL cells. Their relative contribution to CLL survival was assessed both by fluorescent microscopy to identify cellular interactions and by the use of functional tests to measure the impact of uncoupling these pairs with blocking monoclonal antibodies. We found for the first time that lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), expressed in CLL at significantly higher levels than in healthy donor B-cells, and CD2 expressed on NLC, were both key for the specific pro-survival signals delivered by NLC. Moreover, we found that NLC/CLL interactions induced the shedding of soluble LFA-3. Importantly, in an exploratory cohort of 60 CLL patients receiving frontline immunochemotherapy, increased levels of soluble LFA-3 were found to correlate with shorter overall survival. Altogether, these data suggest that LFA-3/CD2 interactions promote the survival of CLL cells in the tumor microenvironment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['cell survival', 'cells cross-talk', 'leukemia', 'tumor associated macrophages']",PMC5581024,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been shown to be activated and increased in FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients, and has further been shown to be critical for transformation and maintenance of the leukemic clone in these patients. Further, over-expression of constitutively activated SYK causes resistance to highly selective FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Up to now, the activity of the multi-targeted FLT3 inhibitor, midostaurin, against cells expressing activated SYK has not been explored in the context of leukemia, although SYK has been identified as a target of midostaurin in systemic mastocytosis. We compared the ability of midostaurin to inhibit activated SYK in mutant FLT3-positive AML cells with that of inhibitors displaying dual SYK/FLT3 inhibition, targeted SYK inhibition, and targeted FLT3 inhibition. Our findings suggest that dual FLT3/SYK inhibitors and FLT3-targeted drugs potently kill oncogenic FLT3-transformed cells, while SYK-targeted small molecule inhibition displays minimal activity. However, midostaurin and other dual FLT3/SYK inhibitors display superior anti-proliferative activity when compared to targeted FLT3 inhibitors, such as crenolanib and quizartinib, against cells co-expressing FLT3-ITD and constitutively activated SYK-TEL. Interestingly, additional SYK suppression potentiated the effects of dual FLT3/SYK inhibitors and targeted FLT3 inhibitors against FLT3-ITD-driven leukemia, both in the absence and presence of activated SYK. Taken together, our findings have important implications for the design of drug combination studies in mutant FLT3-positive patients and for the design of future generations of FLT3 inhibitors.",,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'R406', 'R788', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'midostaurin']",PMC5581010,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['CONFLICTs OF INTEREST P.W.M. is an employee of Novartis Pharma AG.

Therefore, the alternative therapeutic strategies are required. The activation of autophagic mechanism was considered as the main cause of the acquisition of drug resistance in 5-FU treatment. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid, has been regarded as an efficient anticancer agent and can improve the drug resistance in conventional cancer therapy by a low basal level of autophagy in colon cancer cells. Moreover, removal of iron or copper by metal chelators could cause ROS levels increase and mediate cancer cell cytotoxicity led by autophagy. In the present study, we constructed a combination of 5-FU, 1:1 mixture of metal chelators di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone hydrochloride (DpC) and N, N, N', N'-tetrakis-[2-pyridylmethyl]-ethylenediamine (TPEN) named DTN, and DHA to evaluate the anticancer effect of this combination, compared to the traditional 5-FU-based chemotherapy; further we investigated the underlying mechanism. Through inducing ROS-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 ubiquitination, the triple combination of 5-FU, DTN and DHA resulted in the elevated apoptosis in CRC cells, thus to reduce the tumor size and weight. Taken together, this study suggests the triple combination of 5-FU+DTN+DHA exhibits an effective anticancer activity of overcoming drug resistance in colorectal cancer, mechanism as the elevated apoptosis mediated by an increase of ROS and Mcl-1 ubiquitination, may be a novel strategy for clinical colon cancer treatment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'colorectal cancer', 'combination of Fe/Cu -chelators and docosahexaenoic acid', 'myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)', 'ubiquitination']",PMC5584262,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors do not have any conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Combined Decitabine-Vorinostat treatment synergistically decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, enhanced acetylation of histones and further decreased DNMT1 protein with HL-60 cells showing a greater sensitivity to the combined treatment than OCI-AML3. Combination therapy led to reprogramming of unique target genes including AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with cell survival and a poor prognosis in AML, which was significantly upregulated following treatment. Therefore targeting AXL following epi-sensitization with Decitabine and Vorinostat may be a suitable triple combination. To test this, cells were treated with a novel triple combination therapy including BGB324, an AXL specific inhibitor. Triple combination increased the sensitivity of OCI-AML3 cells to Decitabine and Vorinostat as shown through viability assays and significantly extended the survival of mice transplanted with pretreated OCI-AML3 cells, while bioluminescence imaging showed the decrease in disease burden following triple combination treatment. Further investigation is required to optimize this triple combination, however, these results suggest that AXL is a potential marker of response to Decitabine-Vorinostat combination treatment and offers a new avenue of epigenetic combination therapies for acute myeloid leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL receptor tyrosine kinase', 'DNMT inhibitors', 'HDAC inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic combination therapies']",PMC5584259,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest in relation to', 'the work described in this manuscript.']",,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1-encoded oncoprotein Tax induces persistent activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) is overexpressed in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines and ATL cells. Here, we showed that both Tax expression and HTLV-1 infection promoted EGR1 overexpression. Loss of the NF-kappaB binding site in the EGR1 promotor or inhibition of NF-kappaB activation reduced Tax-induced EGR1 upregulation. Tax mutants unable to activate NF-kappaB induced only slight EGR1 upregulation as compared with wild-type Tax, confirming NF-kappaB pathway involvement in EGR1 regulation. Tax also directly interacted with the EGR1 protein and increased endogenous EGR1 stability. Elevated EGR1 in turn promoted p65 nuclear translocation and increased NF-kappaB activation. These results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between EGR1 expression and NF-kappaB activation in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing cells. Both NF-kappaB activation and Tax-induced EGR1 stability upregulated EGR1, which in turn enhanced constitutive NF-kappaB activation and facilitated ATL progression in HTLV-1-infected cells. These findings suggest EGR1 may be an effective anti-ATL therapeutic target.",,['NOTNLM'],"['EGR1', 'HTLV-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'Tax', 'adult T cell leukemia']",PMC5584236,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we detected the expression of miR-125b in CRC tissues, subsequently investigated the effect of miR-125b on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and metastasis on CRC cells. Our results showed that the expression of miR-125b was significantly decreased in CRC tissues comparing to adjacent tissues. However, with the stimulation of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which was highly expressed in CRC tissues, the expression of miR-125b could be improved. Analysis of patient samples revealed that miR-125b presented a clear association with poor differentiation, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. Overexpression of miR-125b inhibited cell proliferation, triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest, induced subsequent apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and invasion. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and western blot clarified that the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) was a direct target of miR-125b. Thus overexpression of MCL1 attenuated the pro-metastasis function of miR-125b in CRC cell lines. In addition, the protein expression level of MCL1 was decreased in CRC tissues from patients with positive lymph node metastasis, which had high miR-125b expression. Collectively, our study suggested that miR-125b induced by G-CSF plays a promoting role in the metastasis of CRC by targeting MCL1, which may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['G-CSF', 'MCL1', 'colorectal cancer', 'metastasis', 'microRNA-125b']",PMC5584181,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,['Oncotarget. 2020 Jan 07;11(1):115.

Although the clinical course of CML was revolutionized by development of Bcr-abl-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), CML is not cured by these agents. Specifically, the majority of subjects relapsed in clinical trials attempting TKI discontinuation, suggesting persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) even in molecular remission. Identifying mechanisms of CML-LSC persistence may suggest rationale therapeutic targets to augment TKI efficacy and lead to cure. Apoptosis resistance is one proposed mechanism. In prior studies, we identified increased expression of Growth Arrest Specific 2 (Gas2; a Calpain inhibitor) in Bcr-abl(+) bone marrow progenitor cells. A number of previously described Calpain substrates might influence apoptosis in CML, including betacatenin and the X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein 1 (Xiap1). We previously found Gas2/Calpain dependent stabilization of betacatenin in CML, and increased expression of betacatenin target genes, including Survivin (also an IAP).

Metformin has also been shown to induce apoptosis in this cancer. Here, we investigate whether metformin-induced apoptosis in HCC is mediated by the downstream mTORC1 effectors eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Further, we ask whether changes in 4E-BPs activity during metformin treatment negatively regulate translation of the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) mRNA. A genetic HCC mouse model was employed to assess the ability of metformin to reduce tumor formation, induce apoptosis, and control 4E-BP1 activation and Mcl-1 protein expression. In parallel, the HCC cell line Huh7 was transduced with scrambled shRNA (control) or shRNAs targeting 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (4E-BP knock-down (KD)) to measure differences in mRNA translation, apoptosis, and Mcl-1 protein expression after metformin treatment. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 protein levels was addressed in a HCC patient tissue microarray. We found that metformin decreased HCC tumor burden, and tumor tissues showed elevated apoptosis with reduced Mcl-1 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 protein levels. In control but not 4E-BP KD Huh7 cells, metformin induced apoptosis and repressed Mcl-1 mRNA translation and protein levels. Immunostaining of HCC patient tumor tissues revealed a varying ratio of eIF4E/4E-BP1 expression.

The treatment commonly involves chemotherapy and, if possible, allogeneic stem cell transplantation which is the only therapeutic option for long-term survival. Given the aggressive course of EMS, we here evaluated tyrosine kinase inhibitors as treatment options to delay disease progression. METHODS: We described a new case of EMS and used chromosome analyses, PCR, and sequencing to investigate the underlying genetic aberrations. The sensitivity to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors was tested in vitro on the EMS cell line KG1 and on primary cells from the newly diagnosed EMS patient. RESULTS: A translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 22 was detected, and a BCR/FGFR1 fusion gene was confirmed and characterized by sequencing. KG1 cells and primary EMS cells displayed distinct sensitivity to dovitinib, ponatinib, and dasatinib as compared to normal bone marrow control cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be beneficial for patients with EMS during the search for a suitable stem cell donor and for those not eligible for transplantation.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One barrier to including QOL endpoints in clinical trials is the lack of a disease-specific QOL instrument that can efficiently capture the major QOL deficits in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to elicit concepts for inclusion in a new AML-specific QOL instrument called the AML-QOL. Eighty-two patients at various stages of disease were interviewed about sources of support (positive concepts) and problems and symptoms (negative concepts) experienced over the past week, and they were asked to grade how much each affected their QOL. In addition, patients were asked to complete 2 validated instruments: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with the leukemia and transplant modules and the 29-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System questionnaire. RESULTS: With data from the open-ended and questionnaire-based portions of the interview, 7 positive concepts and 64 negative concepts were elicited. From these, 5 positive concepts and 21 negative concepts were selected for inclusion in the preliminary AML-QOL on the basis of concept prevalence and the impact on QOL.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with hematological malignancies frequently encounter spine-related symptoms, which are caused by disease itself or process of treatment. However, there is still lack of knowledge on their epidemiology and clinical courses. The purpose of this article is to review clinical presentations and surgical results for spinal involvement of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: From January 2011 to September 2014, 195 patients (98 males and 97 females) suffering from hematological malignancies combined with spinal problems were retrospectively analyzed for clinical and radiological characteristics and their clinical results. RESULTS: The most common diagnosis of hematological malignancy was multiple myeloma (96 patients, 49.7%), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (30, 15.2%), acute myeloid leukemia (22, 11.2%), and lymphoma (15, 7.56%). The major presenting symptoms were mechanical axial pain (132, 67.7%) resulting from pathologic fractures, and followed by radiating pain (49, 25.1%). Progressive neurologic deficits were noted in 15 patients (7.7%), which revealed as cord compression by epidural mass or compressive myelopathy combined with pathologic fractures. Reconstructive surgery for neurologic compromise was done in 16 patients. Even though surgical intervention was useful for early paralysis (Frankel grade D or E), neurologic recovery was not satisfactory for the progressed paralysis (Frankel grade A or B). CONCLUSION: Hematological malignancies may cause various spinal problems related to disease progression or consequences of treatments. Conservative and palliative treatments are mainstay for these lesions. However, timely surgical interventions should be considered for the cases of pathologic fractures with progressive neurologic compromise.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone', 'Fractures', 'Hematologic neoplasms', 'Spinal cord injuries', 'Spine']",PMC5594618,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To accurately estimate risks of mortality by developing and validating a composite model that combines the most significant patient-specific and AML-specific features. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study. A series of comorbidities, including those already incorporated into the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI), were evaluated. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 733) and a validation set (n = 367). In the training set, covariates associated with 1-year overall mortality at a significance level of P < .10 constructed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model in which the impact of each covariate was adjusted for that of all others. Then, the adjusted hazard ratios were used as weights. Performances of models were compared using C statistics for continuous outcomes and area under the curve (AUC) for binary outcomes. Exposures: Initial therapy for AML. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death within 1 year after initial therapy for AML. Results: A total of 1100 patients, ages 20 to 89 years, were treated for AML between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012, at 5 academic institutions specialized in treating AML; 605 (55%) were male, and 495 (45%) were female. In the validation set, the original HCT-CI had better C statistic and AUC estimates compared with the AML comorbidity index for prediction of 1-year mortality. Augmenting the original HCT-CI with 3 independently significant comorbidities, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase level, yielded a better C statistic of 0.66 and AUC of 0.69 for 1-year mortality. A composite model comprising augmented HCT-CI, age, and cytogenetic/molecular risks had even better predictive estimates of 0.72 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, comorbidities influenced 1-year survival of patients with AML, and comorbidities are best captured by an augmented HCT-CI. The augmented HCT-CI, age, and cytogenetic/molecular risks could be combined into an AML composite model that could guide treatment decision-making and trial design in AML. Studying physical, cognitive, and social health might further clarify the prognostic role of aging. Targeting comorbidities with interventions alongside specific AML therapy might improve survival.",,,,PMC5824273,,,,,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2018 Jul 1;4(7):1014-1015.

Hazard ratios (HR) for all cancer and specific cancers by ABO blood type were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with blood type A, blood type B was associated with statistically significant reduced risk of all cancers (HR, 0.91, 95% CI:0.84, 0.99). Both blood types B and AB were associated with significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively. Blood type B was also associated with significantly lower risk of stomach cancer and bladder cancer, while blood type AB was associated with significantly increased risk of liver cancer. By histological type, blood types B and AB were associated with lower risk of epidermoid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, but were not associated with risk of sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia or other cell types of cancer.

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,"Lineage-committed differentiation is an essential biological program during odontogenesis, which is tightly regulated by lineage-specific genes. Some of these genes are modified by colocalization of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks at promoter regions in progenitors. These modifications, named ""bivalent domains,"" maintain genes in a poised state and then resolve for later activation or repression during differentiation. Wnt5a has been reported to promote odontogenic differentiation in dental mesenchyme. However, relatively little is known about the epigenetic modulations on Wnt5a activation during tooth development. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks in developing mouse molars. Associated H3K4me3 methylases (mixed-lineage leukemia [MLL] complex) and H3K27me3 demethylases (JMJD3 and UTX) were dynamically expressed between early and late bell stage of human tooth germs and in cultured human dental papilla cells (hDPCs) during odontogenic induction. Poised WNT5A gene was marked by bivalent domains containing repressive marks (H3K27me3) and active marks (H3K4me3) on promoters. The bivalent domains tended to resolve during inducted differentiation, with removal of the H3K27me3 mark in a JMJD3-dependent manner. When JMJD3 was knocked down in cultured hDPCs, odontogenic differentiation was suppressed. The depletion of JMJD3 epigenetically repressed WNT5A activation by increased H3K27me3 marks. In addition, JMJD3 could physically interact with ASH2L, a component of the MLL complex, to form a coactivator complex, cooperatively modulating H3K4me3 marks on WNT5A promoters. Overall, our study reveals that transcription activities of WNT5A were epigenetically regulated by the negotiated balance between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks and tightly mediated by JMJD3 and MLL coactivator complex, ultimately modulating odontogenic commitment during dental mesenchymal cell differentiation.",,['NOTNLM'],"['KDM6B', 'MLL protein', 'dental papilla', 'epigenetics', 'gene expression', 'histone modifications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are biological agents that are widely used to treat malignancies including non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. They are effective but expensive. The patents for many mAbs are expiring, so biosimilar medicines, which contain a version of the active ingredient of the original drug, are being developed. Biological medicines cannot be assessed in the same way as standard generic medications because they are difficult to copy and can change over time.

METHODS: For a case series with known final outcomes: Consider each case a diagnostic test of good versus poor QOT (expected vs. increased failure rates), determine the likelihood ratio (LR) of the observed outcome, convert LR to weight taking log to base 2, and add up weights sequentially in a plot showing how many times odds in favour of good QOT have been doubled. For a series with observed survival times and an expected survival curve: Divide the curve into time intervals, determine ""healthy"" and specify ""sick"" risks of failure in each interval, construct a ""sick"" survival curve, determine the LR of survival or failure at the given observation times, convert to weights, and add up. RESULTS: The Bayesian plot was applied retrospectively to 39 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with completed follow-up, using Nordic collaborative results as reference, showing equal odds between good and poor QOT. In the ongoing treatment trial, with 22 of 37 children still at risk for event, QOT has been monitored with average survival curves as reference, odds so far favoring good QOT 2:1. CONCLUSION: QOT in small patient series can be assessed with a Bayesian CUSUM plot, retrospectively when all treatment outcomes are known, but also in ongoing series with unfinished follow-up.","['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CUSUM plots', 'clinical audit', 'evaluation', 'health services research']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the reprogramming process remains very inefficient and a better understanding of its basic biology is required. The mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) has been recognized as a crucial step for the successful reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPSCs. It has been reported that the p53 tumor suppressor gene acts as a barrier of this process, while its homolog p63 acts as an enabling factor. In this regard, the information concerning the role of the third homolog, p73, during cell reprogramming is limited. Here, we derive total Trp73 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with or without Trp53, and examine their reprogramming capacity. We show that p73 is required for effective reprogramming by the Yamanaka factors, even in the absence of p53. Lack of p73 affects the early stages of reprogramming, impairing the MET and resulting in altered maturation and stabilization phases. Accordingly, the obtained p73-deficient iPSCs have a defective epithelial phenotype and alterations in the expression of pluripotency markers. We demonstrate that p73 deficiency impairs the MET, at least in part, by hindering BMP pathway activation. We report that p73 is a positive modulator of the BMP circuit, enhancing its activation by DNp73 repression of the Smad6 promoter. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the MET process, proposing p73 as an enhancer of MET during cellular reprogramming.",,,,PMC5636977,['R35 CA197452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of or mutations in the SMN1 gene cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with degeneration and loss of motor neurons. Reduced SMN levels in SMA lead to deficient snRNP biogenesis with consequent splicing pathology. Here, we demonstrate that SMN is a novel and specific target of the acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein). Furthermore, we identify lysine (K) 119 as the main acetylation site in SMN. Importantly, SMN acetylation enhances its cytoplasmic localization, causes depletion of CBs, and reduces the accumulation of snRNPs in nuclear speckles. In contrast, the acetylation-deficient SMNK119R mutant promotes formation of CBs and a novel category of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies enriched in this protein.

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,"The Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are characterised by the aberrant activation of multiple signalling pathways. Here we show that a subset of HL displays altered expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors (S1PR)s. S1P activates phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) in these cells that is mediated by the increased expression of S1PR1 and the decreased expression of S1PR2. We also showed that genes regulated by the PI3-K signalling pathway in HL cell lines significantly overlap with the transcriptional programme of primary HRS cells. Genes upregulated by the PI3-K pathway included the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like 3 (BATF3), which is normally associated with the development of dendritic cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that BATF3 was expressed in HRS cells of most HL cases. In contrast, in normal lymphoid tissues, BATF3 expression was confined to a small fraction of CD30-positive immunoblasts. Knockdown of BATF3 in HL cell lines revealed that BATF3 contributed to the transcriptional programme of primary HRS cells, including the upregulation of S1PR1. Our data suggest that disruption of this potentially oncogenic feedforward S1P signalling loop could provide novel therapeutic opportunities for patients with HL.",,,,PMC5737877,"['10066/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM043880/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['EMS73786'],,,,,['Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):2126.

BST2s from different mammals also possess antiviral activity. Bovine BST2s (bBST2s), bBST2A1 and bBST2A2, reduce production of cell-free bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). However, the effect of bBST2 on other retroviruses remains unstudied. RESULTS: Here, we studied the antiviral activity of wildtype and mutant bBST2A1 proteins on retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), prototypic foamy virus (PFV), bovine foamy virus (BFV) and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). The results showed that wildtype bBST2A1 suppressed the release of HIV-1, PFV and BFV. We also generated bBST2A1 mutants, and found that GPI anchor and dimerization, but not glycosylation, are essential for antiviral activity of bBST2A1. Moreover, unlike hBST2, bBST2A1 displayed no inhibitory effect on cell-to-cell transmission of PFV, BFV and BIV. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that bBST2A1 inhibited retrovirus release, however, had no effect on cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BFV', '*BIV', '*Cell-to-cell transmission', '*HIV-1', '*PFV', '*Virus release', '*bBST2A1']",PMC5588738,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many elderly and unfit patients cannot receive such treatment due to an unacceptable risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Disease-stabilizing therapy is then the only possible strategy, one alternative being treatment based on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid and possibly low-toxicity conventional chemotherapy. METHODS: Primary AML cells were derived from 43 patients included in two clinical studies of treatment based on ATRA, valproic acid and theophyllamine; low toxicity chemotherapy (low-dose cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) was also allowed. Pretreatment leukemic cells were analyzed by mutation profiling of 54 genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies and by global gene expression profiling before and during in vivo treatment. RESULTS: Patients were classified as responders and non-responders to the treatment, however response to treatment showed no significant associations with karyotype or mutational profiles. Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) showed that responders and non-responders significantly differed with regard to the expression of 179 different genes. The differentially expressed genes encoding proteins with a known function were further classified based on the PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system. The identified genes encoded proteins that are involved in several important biological functions, but a main subset of the genes were important for transcriptional regulation. These pretherapy differences in gene expression were largely maintained during treatment. Our analyses of primary AML cells during in vivo treatment suggest that ATRA modulates HOX activity (i.e. decreased expression of HOXA3, HOXA4 and HOXA5 and their regulator PBX3), but altered function of DNA methyl transferase 3A (DNMT3A) and G-protein coupled receptor signaling may also contribute to the effect of the overall treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Responders and non-responders to AML stabilizing treatment based on ATRA and valproic acid differ in the pretreatment transcriptional regulation of their leukemic cells, and these differences may be important for the clinical effect of this treatment.

We aim to investigate NUCKS expression and its clinical significance in ovarian cancer. The messenger RNA expression of NUCKS was determined in normal and malignant ovarian tissues using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the status of NUCKS protein expression in 121 ovarian cancer tissues. NUCKS protein high expression was detected in 52 (43.0%) of 121 patients. NUCKS messenger RNA expression was gradually upregulated in non-metastatic ovarian cancers ( n = 20), metastatic ovarian cancers ( n = 20), and its matched metastatic lesions ( n = 20) in comparison with that in normal ovarian tissues ( n = 10; p < 0.05). Elevated expression of NUCKS in ovarian cancer was associated significantly with the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage ( p = 0.037), histological grade ( p = 0.003), residual disease ( p = 0.013), lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.002), response to chemotherapy ( p < 0.001), and recurrence ( p = 0.013). In the multivariate Cox analysis, NUCKS expression was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival and disease-free survival in ovarian cancer with p values of <0.001 for both. Especially, NUCKS overexpression had prognostic potential for overall survival and disease-free survival ( p < 0.001 for both) in advanced ovarian cancers and only for disease-free survival in early ovarian cancers ( p = 0.017). Our data suggest that NUCKS overexpression may contribute to progression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer especially in advanced ovarian cancer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['NUCKS', 'Ovarian cancer', 'lymph node metastasis', 'prognosis', 'resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are on average 100 to 400 bp long and are derived from unique non-repetitive genomic regions with high gene density. MicroDNAs are thought to arise from DNA breaks associated with RNA metabolism or replication slippage. Given the paucity of information on this entirely novel phenomenon, we aimed to get an additional insight into microDNA features by performing the microDNA analysis in 20 independent human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) prior and after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. The results showed non-random genesis of microDNA clusters from the active regions of the genome. The size periodicity of 190 bp was observed, which matches DNA fragmentation typical for apoptotic cells. The chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis of LCLs increased both number and size of clusters further suggesting that part of microDNAs could result from the programmed cell death. Interestingly, proportion of identified microDNA sequences has common loci of origin when compared between cell line experiments. While compatible with the original observation that microDNAs originate from a normal physiological process, obtained results imply complementary source of its production. Furthermore, non-random genesis of microDNAs depicted by redundancy between samples makes these entities possible candidates for new biomarker generation.",,,,PMC5587290,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this study was to assess rates of adherence to 6-MP using two different methods in children and adolescents with ALL. Secondary aim was to identify factors that influence adherence to 6-MP in children with ALL. METHODS: All eligible children with ALL who are (</= 19) years old and receive 6-MP therapy for at least 1 month were approached to participate in the study. A total of 52 children with ALL and their primary caregivers were recruited. Adherence measures included an objective method (measuring 6-MP metabolites in packed Red Blood Cells (RBCs)) and a subjective method (using parent and child self-report via the Medication Adherence Report Scale; MARS; Adherence was defined as 90% or greater). RESULTS: Rates of adherence varied across the measurement methods. Packed RBCs sample analysis indicated forty-four patients (84.6%) to be adherent. Using the MARS questionnaires, a total of 49 children (94.2%) were classified as being adherent according to the parental MARS questionnaire scores, while all the 15 children (100%) who answered the MARS (child) questionnaire were classified as adherent. Overall adherence rate was 80.8% within the studied population. CONCLUSION: MARS scale was shown to overestimate adherence compared to measurement of 6-MP metabolites in the blood. A combination of both methods led to increased detection of non-adherence to thiopurine in children with ALL.",,,,PMC5587295,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 6.,"Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown very promising results as treatment for cancer in a few clinical trials, such as the complete remissions of otherwise terminal leukemia patients. Nevertheless, the introduction of ACT into clinics requires overcoming not only medical but also technical challenges, such as the ex vivo expansion of large amounts of specific T-cells. Nanostructured surfaces represent a novel T-cell stimulation technique that enables us to fine-tune the density and orientation of activating molecules presented to the cells. In this work, we studied the influence of integrin-mediated cell-adhesion on T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation using nanostructured surfaces, which provide a well-defined system at the nanoscale compared with standard cultures. Specifically, we synthesized a polymeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel cross-linked with two fibronectin-derived peptides, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) and cyclic Leu-Asp-Val (cLDV), that are known to activate different integrins. Moreover, the hydrogels were decorated with a quasi-hexagonal array of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with the activating antibody CD3 to initiate T-cell activation. Both cLDV and cRGD hydrogels showed higher T-cell activation (CD69 expression and IL-2 secretion) than nonfunctionalized PEG hydrogels. However, only the cRGD hydrogels clearly supported proliferation giving a higher proportion of cells with memory (CD4(+)CD45RO(+)) than naive (CD4(+)CD45RA(+)) phenotypes when interparticle distances smaller than 150 nm were used. Thus, T-cell proliferation can be enhanced by the activation of integrins through the RGD sequence.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Nanostructures', '*T-cells', '*hydrogels', '*integrins', '*peptides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, ECMM leaves more strongly suppressed the release of beta-hexosaminidase than ECMM flowers. ECMM leaves also significantly suppressed the PCA reaction in the murine model. High-performance liquid chromatography and (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that cirsimaritin, a flavonoid, was concentrated in active fractions of the extract.

In a retrospective cohort of 274 children (1-21 years) treated for B-ALL from 2008 to 2015, 55.5% enrolled with no disparity in enrollment by age, sex, or ethnicity. Three-year EFS was similar for enrolled and not enrolled patients (90.1% [95% CI, 82.5-94.5] versus 86.5% [95% CI, 77.7-92.0]). Clinical trial enrollment did not affect pediatric B-ALL survival, albeit in a limited-size cohort treated at a single academic institution.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['clinical trial enrollment', 'clinical trial participation', 'disparities', 'pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'survival']",PMC7553364,['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1618513'],,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the intrafamilial transmission of HTLV-1 among Japanese immigrants and their descendants living in a non-endemic area of central Brazil. Six families were investigated. Thirty-seven relatives of the six index cases were tested by ELISA for the presence of anti-HTLV antibodies, and the positive cases were confirmed by Western blot. HTLV-1 isolates were genotyped by partial nucleotide sequencing (5' LTR) of the proviral DNA. All individuals, including index cases and relatives, were asymptomatic. In five families, at least one relative was infected with HTLV-1. In all, eight (22%) relatives (one mother, four wives, one brother, and two brothers-in-law) were infected. However, none of the 22 individuals under 55 years of age was infected. In each family, the HTLV-1 sequences from the relatives were identical or almost identical to that of the index case, except in one case. Pedigrees of the families, together with socio-demographic data of the HTLV-1 infected individuals, strongly suggested the occurrence of both vertical and sexual transmission, with breastfeeding as an important risk factor. Whether and why the virus transmission is less effective among younger generations deserves to be further investigated.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Okinawa', '*human T-lymphotropic virus', '*pedigree', '*sexual transmission', '*vertical transmission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to analyze the impacts of these mutations on clinical outcomes, and assess the efficacy of different therapeutic regimens (allo-HSCT, sorafenib, or conventional chemotherapy) for AML patients with FLT3 mutations after the standard induction therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed DNA samples from 158 consecutive de novo AML patients (18-60 years, excluding APL) with FLT3 mutations between July 2010 and October 2015. RESULTS: We found that AML patients with FLT3-TKD mutations have more favorable clinical outcomes than those with FLT3-ITD mutations. We also found that allo-HSCT therapy subgroup achieved longer OS and RFS than non-allo-HSCT therapy subgroup for FLT3-ITD positive patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.071). However, compared with the clinical outcomes in non-primary refractory patients, sorafenib did not show an obvious beneficial effect for the primary refractory patients. Further study on a large scale is still recommended. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3-TKD-mutated AML patients have more favorable clinical outcomes than those with FLT3-ITD mutations. Allo-HSCT therapy subgroup achieved longer OS and RFS than non-allo-HSCT therapy subgroup for FLT3-ITD positive patients.

Epub 2017 Sep 6.,"Targeting survival mechanisms of immune cells may provide an avenue for immune intervention to dampen unwanted responses (e.g. autoimmunity, immunopathology and transplant rejection) or enhance beneficial ones (e.g. immune deficiency, microbial defence and cancer immunotherapy). The selective survival mechanisms of the various immune cell types also avails the possibility of specific tailoring of such interventions. Here, we review the role of the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic family members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1 and A1) on cell death/survival of the major immune cell types, for example, T, NK, B, dendritic cell (DC) lineages. There is both selectivity and redundancy among this family. Selectivity comes partly from the expression levels in each of the cell types. For example, plasmacytoid DC express abundant BCL-2 and are susceptible to BCL-2 antagonism or deficiency, whereas conventional DC express abundant A1 and are susceptible to A1 deficiency. There is, however, also functional redundancy; for example, overexpression of MCL-1 can override BCL-2 antagonism in plasmacytoid DC. Moreover, susceptibility to another anti-apoptotic family member can be unmasked, when one or other member is removed. These dual principles of selectivity and redundancy should guide the use of antagonists for manipulating immune cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although traditional Chinese medicine has extensive clinical experience in the treatment of leukemia, the mechanism is not clear. The targeted drugs are attractive for the advantages of the high selectivity and little side effects. Targeted therapies in pediatric leukemia are targeting BCR/ABL, TARA and FLT3 proteins, which activation results in the downstream activation of multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, JNK/STAT, Ras/ERK pathways.

Addition of age to the multivariable model did not affect these results while accounting for IPSS-R weakened the significance of TP53 mutations/variants (P = .1). An apparently favorable survival impact of SF3B1 mutations was no longer evident after adjustment for IPSS-R. Approximately 41% and 20% of patients harbored at least one adverse mutation/variant for overall and leukemia-free survival, respectively. Number of mutations/variants did not provide additional prognostic value. The survival impact of adverse mutations was most evident in IPSS-R very low/low risk patients. These observations suggest that targeted NGS might assist in treatment decision-making in lower risk MDS.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression or activation of mediators such as osteopontin (OPN) or PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a key role in making prone to develop leukemia. Preventing or treating cancer by curcumin (CUR) has been suggested recently. CUR induces apoptosis and growth inhibition through various mechanisms in leukemic cells. In present study, we tried to measure the toxic response in vitro to CUR for evaluation ofchangesin cell viability, survival and molecular-mediated resistance in primary AML cells. Materials and Methods: Isolated primary CD34+/CD38- bone marrow derived AML cells were treated with CUR, Daunorubicin (DNR) and/or their combination by MTT assay, Annexin V/PI staining, and colony-formation. The mRNA expression of OPN/AKT/mTOR/PTEN/beta-catenin genes was measured by Real-Time PCR. The siRNA against OPN was applied for CUR- treated cells. Results: Growth inhibition effect of DNR increased in combination with CUR on primary CD34+/CD38- AML cells. Suppression of OPN with siRNA increased the cytotoxic effects of CUR. Likewise, OPN gene expression increased in response to CUR treatment in AML cells. AKT, mTOR, beta-catenin or PTEN gene expression increased by CUR, but OPN siRNA decreased the level of mRNA expression of mentioned molecular pathway. Conclusion: The chemo-resistance of AML cells against therapy might be relevant to increasing of OPN mRNA expression and activity of other mediators including AKT, mTOR, PTEN, and beta-catenin. In this context, targeting of OPN might be more impact on CD34+ AML cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Curcumin', 'Osteopontin']",PMC5574411,,,,,,,,,,,,

In innate immune cells the presence of cytosolic DNA is sensed by the cGAS-STING signalling pathway, which initiates a gene expression programme linked to cellular activation and cytokine production. Whether the outcome of the STING response varies between distinct cell types remains largely unknown. Here we show that T cells exhibit an intensified STING response, which leads to the expression of a distinct set of genes and results in the induction of apoptosis. Of note, this proapoptotic STING response is still functional in cancerous T cells and delivery of small molecule STING agonists prevents in vivo growth of T-cell-derived tumours independent of its adjuvant activity. Our results demonstrate how the magnitude of STING signalling can shape distinct effector responses, which may permit for cell type-adjusted behaviours towards endogenous or exogenous insults.The cGAS/STING signalling pathway is responsible for sensing intracellular DNA and activating downstream inflammatory genes. Here the authors show mouse primary T cells and T leukaemia are hyperresponsive to STING agonist, and this strong STING signalling is associated with apoptosis induction.",,,,PMC5585373,['677251/European Research Council/International'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that Smad7 activates signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in maintaining mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency in a manner independent of the TGF-beta receptors, yet dependent on the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) coreceptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). Smad7 directly binds to the intracellular domain of gp130 and disrupts the SHP2-gp130 or SOCS3-gp130 complex, thereby amplifying STAT3 activation. Consequently, Smad7 facilitates LIF-mediated self-renewal of mouse ESCs and is also critical for induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming.

Epub 2017 Sep 5.,"Arginine methylation on histones is a central player in epigenetics and in gene activation and repression. Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) activity has been implicated in stem cell pluripotency, cancer metastasis, and tumorigenesis. The expression of one of the nine mammalian PRMTs, PRMT5, affects the levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) at Arg-3 on histone H4, leading to the repression of genes which are related to disease progression in lymphoma and leukemia. Another PRMT, PRMT7, also affects SDMA levels at the same site despite its unique monomethylating activity and the lack of any evidence for PRMT7-catalyzed histone H4 Arg-3 methylation. We present evidence that PRMT7-mediated monomethylation of histone H4 Arg-17 regulates PRMT5 activity at Arg-3 in the same protein. We analyzed the kinetics of PRMT5 over a wide range of substrate concentrations. Significantly, we discovered that PRMT5 displays positive cooperativity in vitro, suggesting that this enzyme may be allosterically regulated in vivo as well. Most interestingly, monomethylation at Arg-17 in histone H4 not only raised the general activity of PRMT5 with this substrate, but also ameliorated the low activity of PRMT5 at low substrate concentrations. These kinetic studies suggest a biochemical explanation for the interplay between PRMT5- and PRMT7-mediated methylation of the same substrate at different residues and also suggest a general model for regulation of PRMTs.

Epub 2017 Sep 5.,"Autotaxin (ATX), which is highly expressed and secreted by adipocytes, functions as the key enzyme to generate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine. Adipose tissue is the main source of circulating ATX that modulates plasma LPA levels. Upregulation of ATX expression in obese patients and mice is closely related with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. However, the mechanism of ATX expression in adipocytes remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that glycoprotein 130 (gp130)-mediated Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation was required for abundant ATX expression in adipocytes. Through gp130, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family cytokines, such as IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-1, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, upregulated ATX expression in adipocytes. ATX contributes to the induction of insulin resistance and lipolysis in IL-6-stimulated adipocytes. Oral administration of gp130 inhibitor SC144 suppressed ATX expression in adipose tissue, decreased plasma ATX, LPA, and FFA levels, and significantly improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in high-fat diet-fed obese mice. In summary, our results indicate that the activation of gp130-JAK-STAT3 pathway by IL-6 family cytokines has an important role in regulating ATX expression in adipocytes and that gp130 is a promising target in the management of obesity-associated glucose metabolic diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular', 'Biology, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adipocyte', '*autotaxin', '*glycoprotein 130', '*insulin sensitivity', '*obesity']",PMC5665664,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that N-terminally truncated POM121C, a component of the nuclear pore complex, blocks HIV-1 infection. This truncated protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, does not bind to CA, does not affect viral cDNA synthesis, reduces the formation of 2-LTR and diminished the amount of integrated proviral DNA. Studies with an HIV-1-murine leukemia virus (MLV) chimeric virus carrying the MLV-derived Gag revealed that Gag is a determinant of this inhibition. Intriguingly, mutational studies have revealed that the blockade by N-terminally-truncated POM121C is closely linked to its binding to importin-beta/karyopherin subunit beta 1 (KPNB1). These results indicate that N-terminally-truncated POM121C inhibits HIV-1 infection after completion of reverse transcription and before integration, and suggest an important role for KPNB1 in HIV-1 replication.",,,,PMC5584925,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bcr-Abl-expressing BaF cells were used as a leukaemia model and the role of Ffar2 was evaluated in Balb/c mice after lentiviral shRNA transduction. RESULTS: Our data formally establish that reduced leukaemic cell proliferation is associated with increased Ffar2 expression in vivo and in vitro. Going beyond association, we point out that decreasing Ffar2 expression fosters cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the role of Ffar2 in the control of leukaemic cell proliferation in vivo and indicate that a modulation of Ffar2 expression through nutritional tools or pharmacological agents may constitute an attractive therapeutic approach to tackle leukaemia progression in humans.",,,,PMC5672929,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 5.,"BACKGROUND: Variants in the human X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene have been reported as being etiologically associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 2 (EIEE2). We report on two patients, a boy and a girl, with EIEE2 that present with early onset epilepsy, hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, and poor eye contact. METHODS: Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of a custom-designed gene panel for epilepsy and epileptic encephalopathy containing 112 epilepsy-related genes was performed. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the novel variants. For confirmation of the functional consequence of an intronic CDKL5 variant in patient 2, an RNA study was done. RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed de novo variants in CDKL5, a c.2578C>T (p. Gln860*) present in a hemizygous state in a 3-year-old boy, and a potential splice site variant c.463+5G>A in heterozygous state in a 5-year-old girl. Multiple in silico splicing algorithms predicted a highly reduced splice site score for c.463+5G>A. A subsequent mRNA study confirmed an aberrant shorter transcript lacking exon 7. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirmed that variants in the CDKL5 are associated with EIEE2. There is credible evidence that the novel identified variants are pathogenic and, therefore, are likely the cause of the disease in the presented patients. In one of the patients a stop codon variant is predicted to produce a truncated protein, and in the other patient an intronic variant results in aberrant splicing.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CDKL5 gene', 'early onset seizures', 'infantile epileptic encephalopathy 2', 'massively parallel sequencing', 'splice site variant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 5.,"The gene that encodes de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia genomes. Point mutations at position R882 have been shown to cause a dominant negative loss of DNMT3A methylation activity, but 15% of DNMT3A mutations are predicted to produce truncated proteins that could either have dominant negative activities or cause loss of function and haploinsufficiency. Here, we demonstrate that 3 of these mutants produce truncated, inactive proteins that do not dimerize with WT DNMT3A, strongly supporting the haploinsufficiency hypothesis. We therefore evaluated hematopoiesis in mice heterozygous for a constitutive null Dnmt3a mutation. With no other manipulations, Dnmt3a+/- mice developed myeloid skewing over time, and their hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells exhibited a long-term competitive transplantation advantage. Dnmt3a+/- mice also spontaneously developed transplantable myeloid malignancies after a long latent period, and 3 of 12 tumors tested had cooperating mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway. The residual Dnmt3a allele was neither mutated nor downregulated in these tumors. The bone marrow cells of Dnmt3a+/- mice had a subtle but statistically significant DNA hypomethylation phenotype that was not associated with gene dysregulation. These data demonstrate that haploinsufficiency for Dnmt3a alters hematopoiesis and predisposes mice (and probably humans) to myeloid malignancies by a mechanism that is not yet clear.",,,,PMC5617681,"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This article describes a simple protocol to obtain mESC lines with high derivation efficiencies (60-80%) by culturing blastocysts from permissive mouse strains on feeder cells in defined medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor. The protocol can also be applied to efficiently derive mESC lines from non-permissive mouse strains, by the simple addition of a cocktail of two small-molecule inhibitors to the derivation medium (2i medium). Detailed procedures on the preparation and culture of feeder cells, collection and culture of mouse embryos, and derivation and culture of mESC lines are provided.

She had no abnormalities in serum cholesterol or triglycerides levels. A detailed laboratory analysis revealed the presence of mild monoclonal gammopathy with a presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa light chains; however, according to hematologist consultation, it did not require medical intervention. Imaging assessment and ultrasound examination did not show any specific involvement of internal organs. The skin biopsy demonstrated necrobiotic areas alternated with foci of xanthogranulomatous infiltration throughout the reticular dermis with extension into subcutaneous tissue. The granulomatous infiltrate was composed of epithelioid, foamy histiocytes in addition to conspicuous giant cells of the Touton type and foreign body type, as well as variable numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophiles. Lipid vacuoles were seen within the foci of necrobiosis and xanthogranulomatous infiltration (Figure 2). Two months after first admission to our department, the first signs of necrosis within the lesions were noted, and massive necrosis of skin lesions occurred after the following 5 months (Figure 1). Based on the clinical manifestation and histological and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) was established. In our patient, the extremely late onset of the disease, its very aggressive course, and the absence of malignant hematological disorder were remarkable. The general condition improved after local treatment and a low dose of prednisone. However, patient anamnesis revealed myocardial infarction in the past, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Eventually, the patient died due to acute heart failure before alkylating agents could be administered; we consider the patient's death to have been unrelated to NXG. NXG is a rare, chronic granulomatous disorder which was first described in 1980 by Kossard and Winkelmann (1). Currently, less than one hundred fifty cases of this syndrome have been reported in the literature worldwide (2,3). The disease occurs during adulthood, slightly more frequently in women, and usually after the age of 60 years, although the youngest reported patient was 17 years old (3). The disease initially manifests as xanthoma-like eruptions of yellowish or red-orange papules and nodules that coalesce into indurated plaques (4). The size of the lesions typically increases over time or with the next recurrences. In comparison to hyperlipemic and normolipemic xanthomas, the lesions are firmer, more prominent, and more polymorphic (3) with superficial telangiectasias, sometimes erythematous and/or violaceous borders, and atrophy (5). Ulcerations of the lesions were observed in about 50% of patients and tended to be extensive and progressive (4). Skin lesions of NXG can occur anywhere on the body. However, about two-thirds of patients had periorbital involvement, particularly on the upper and/or lower eyelids or elsewhere on the face. The second most commonly affected site was the trunk, predominantly the chest (3-6). However, many skin lesions first appear on the trunk or extremities and subsequently involve the periorbital area (4). More than one body area was affected in about 90% of the published cases (3,4). In individual cases, the occurrence of NXG was noted within scars, after trauma, or in a previously X-ray irradiated area (5). Lesions may be asymptomatic; however, over half of patients asked reported various symptoms, predominantly itching but also burning, tenderness, and even pain (4,5). Periorbital skin lesions are often accompanied by ophthalmic manifestations, mainly scleritis, choroiditis, or conjunctivitis (3), and with complications such as blepharoptosis, restricted ocular motility, and proptosis (4,5). Extracutaneous lesions are most commonly seen in the respiratory tract, including the lungs and larynx, followed by the myocardium, oral cavity, skeletal muscles, kidneys, ovaries, intestine, and other sites (5,6). Extracutaneous involvement was reported in less than 20% of cases (3), but its frequency seems to have increased in recent years (5). Regarding laboratory abnormalities, the majority of patients with NXG (70% and up to 90% depending on the studied population) have a monoclonal gammopathy (more often IgG-kappa than IgG-lambda). Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, leukopenia, low C1 and C4 levels, and cryoglobulinemia are also frequently present (3-6). Incisional biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of NXG, but correlations between the clinical presentation and specific histopathologic findings have been poorly characterized so far. The histopathology shows an inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages, foam cells, plasma cells, and other inflammatory cells as well as Touton and foreign body-type giant cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Necrobiosis is usually present, and nodular lymphoid aggregates are common. Cholesterol clefts or asteroid bodies are rare or absent. The epidermis may be atrophic or normal. Special stains are not helpful in establishing the diagnosis of NXG, but immunohistochemistry for CD68 is positive while it is always for CD1a and PS100 negative, like in non-X histiocytosis (4,5). In patients without a known myeloproliferative disorder, bone marrow biopsy may reveal atypical or increased plasma cells and, very rarely, true multiple myeloma (5). As mentioned above, NXG can be a manifestation of multiple myeloma. However, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and other lymphoproliferative diseases have also been reported in patients with NXG (3). Remarkably, hematological disorders may emerge many years before or after the onset of skin lesions (even up to 11 years) (4). According to available literature data, the course of the disease is usually chronic and slowly progressive, and the prognosis is relatively good in the absence of co-occurrence of malignant hematological disorders ([5-7). Aside from hyperlipemic and normolipemic xanthomas, the differential diagnosis of NXG includes multifocal necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare, foreign-body granuloma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, rheumatoid nodules, and amyloidosis (4). In 5 cases from the literature, xanthoma and NXG were present at the same time (3). Despite several hypotheses, the etiopathogenesis of NXG remains unknown (3,4,8). For that reason and due to the rarity of the disease, the optimal therapy has not been not defined. Frequently, chlorambucil or melphalan have been used alone or in combination with prednisone (4). Treatment may result in remission of symptoms on the skin, but it does not provide a permanent cure (8). There are also single reports of the successful use of thalidomide, lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, interferon 2a and 2b, plasmapheresis and hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, infliximab, and autologous bone marrow transplantation (3). Methotrexate seems to be ineffective (9). Local therapy, including local steroids, laser CO2, or radiotherapy, results in partial improvement (3,4). Skin lesions which relapsed or were unresponsive to treatment could be excised surgically and the defects resurfaced with skin grafts. [2].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of HAT and HDAC in tumor tissues were detected by chemical colorimetry assay, and expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC6 were detected by Western blotting assay. The expression levels of vital genes closely associated with autophagy and mRNA expressions of HDAC6 and Hsp90 were detected by Real time-PCR. HE staining was used to observe apoptosis, and immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expressions of HDAC6, Hsp90 and activated caspases 3. The results showed that ginsenoside Rh(2) could inhibit the growth of k562 cells allograft tumor, with a tumor inhibition rate up to 53.10%. Ginsenoside Rh(2) could significantly decrease HDAC activity and decrease the expressions of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC6, and inhibit the expressions of HDAC6 and HSP90, increase the expressions of vital autophagy genes (beclin-1, LC3A and LC3B). Histopathological results showed that ginsenosides Rh(2) could significantly increase the tumor apoptosis.

METHODOLOGY: This was an open study with one group. Healthy varicella-susceptible adults and children living in the same household as children with cancer or leukaemia were vaccinated with a new live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) which is stable when stored at 2-8 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) for at least 24 months (Varilrix). Children less than 13 years of age received one dose (0.5 mL containing at least 10(3.3) plaque forming units) by subcutaneous injection and those aged over 13 years received two doses 8 weeks apart. Adverse reactions following vaccination were recorded daily by the vaccinees. Post-vaccination antibody estimation was determined using indirect immunofluorescence 6 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: Thirty-five seronegative subjects (28 children and 7 adults and adolescents) were vaccinated. All subjects tested (34) had seroconverted after vaccination. Local injection site reactions were experienced by 15/35. Other adverse reactions were uncommon (rash 2/35, fever (>/= 37.5 degrees C) 3/35). No cases of clinical varicella occurred amongst the high-risk household contacts of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of this formulation of varicella vaccine in household contacts of children with cancer or leukaemia. The vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic, but further follow-up is needed to document duration of immunity.",,['NOTNLM'],"['immunosuppression', 'leukaemia', 'paediatric cancer', 'vaccine', 'varicella']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a rare case of pyoderma gangrenosum in the thoracic abdomen following post-mastectomy reconstructive surgery. A 39-year-old presented at the hospital with a complaint of left papilla erosion. Skin biopsy at the site revealed invasive skin cancer, with Paget-like progression in the cancerous nipple and suspected malignancy of skin appendages. After partial mastectomy including the areola, invasive ductal breast carcinoma was diagnosed. The patient underwent a subsequent full mastectomy with simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy and primary breast reconstructive surgery using a rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Two weeks post-surgery, healing of the abdominal surgical wound was found to be delayed, and suture abscess was suspected. Despite localized treatment, an ulcerative lesion developed in the thoracic region, and pyoderma gangrenosum was diagnosed following skin biopsy. After the introduction of steroid pulse therapy, no progression of the lesion was observed. This report describes the disease characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of post-surgical pyoderma gangrenosum and discusses the case in the context of previous literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment had been personalized, depending on the clinical presentation and course of disease. Majority of the patients received anakinra, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and steroids. Fourteen (74%) patients survived, with clinical improvement by the time of discharge. After excluding the three patients with underlying leukemia/lymphoma who opted for palliative care and subsequently died, the survival rate was 88%.

Here we identify a promoter enriched for active chromatin marks in BRE intron 4 causing strong biallelic expression of a previously unknown C-terminal BRE transcript. This transcript starts with BRE intron 4 sequences spliced to exon 5 and downstream sequences, and if translated might code for an N terminally truncated BRE protein. Remarkably, the new BRE transcript was highly expressed in over 50% of 11q23/KMT2A (lysine methyl transferase 2A)-rearranged and t(8;16)/KAT6A-CREBBP cases, while it was virtually absent from other AML subsets and normal tissues. In gene reporter assays, the leukemia-specific fusion protein KMT2A-MLLT3 transactivated the intragenic BRE promoter. Further epigenome analyses revealed 97 additional intragenic promoter marks frequently bound by KMT2A in AML with C-terminal BRE expression. The corresponding genes may be part of a context-dependent KMT2A-MLLT3-driven oncogenic program, because they were higher expressed in this AML subtype compared with other groups. C-terminal BRE might be an important contributor to this program because in a case with relapsed AML, we observed an ins(11;2) fusing CHORDC1 to BRE at the region where intragenic transcription starts in KMT2A-rearranged and KAT6A-CREBBP AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases, thyroid cancers are caused by deregulated miRNA expression, especially involving the miR17-92 cluster. miR17-92 transcription is altered in several different tumor types including lymphoma, leukemia, and of the breast and thyroid. As an intronic cluster, miR17-92 must be processed during splicing and therefore interaction between microprocessor and spliceosome machineries is of major importance in understanding its expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the protein composition of spliceosomes assembled on pre-RNAs containing intronic miR18a and miR19a, components of the miR17-92 cluster, using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Interestingly, we observed that proteins associated with intronic miR18a and miR19a are cell-specific, and are similar for both miRNAs analyzed.

Cancer microenvironment can modulate DCs maturation resulting in their accumulation into functional states associated with a reduced antitumor immune response. In this regard, a successful cancer vaccine needs to mount a potent antitumor immune response able to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor milieu. As a consequence, DCs-based approaches are a safe and promising strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy in hematological malignancies, particularly in combinations with additional treatments.

Epub 2017 Sep 9.,"Pretargeting represents a promising strategy to enhance delivery of nanoparticles. The strategy involves first introducing bispecific antibodies or fusion proteins (BFP) that can bind specific epitopes on target cells with one arm, and use the other arm to capture subsequently administered effector molecules, such as radionuclides or drug-loaded nanoparticles. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether BFP that bind slowly- or non-internalizing epitopes on target cells can facilitate efficient intracellular delivery. Here, we investigated the cellular uptake of biotin-functionalized nanoparticles with streptavidin-scFv against TAG-72, a membrane protein on Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. Unlike conventional active-targeted nanoparticles, we found that pretargeting resulted in preferential retention of approximately 100nm nanoparticles at the plasma membrane rather than internalization into cells. We found no improvement in nanoparticle internalization by simply reducing nanoparticle concentration or surface biotin density. Interestingly, by adding both the BFP and a monoclonal antibody against TAG-72, we observed a twofold improvement in internalization of pretargeted nanoparticles. Our work illustrates that the cellular fate of pretargeted nanoparticles can be controlled by carefully tuning the interactions between pretargeting molecules and nanoparticles on the cell surface. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Pretargeting is a multi-step strategy that utilizes bispecific proteins that recognize both cellular epitopes and subsequently administered therapeutic molecules. This approach has been extensively studied for radiotherapy of blood cancers; however, pretargeting remains largely underexplored for nanoparticle targeting, including whether pretargeting can facilitate efficient intracellular delivery. Here, we found that high density of targeting proteins on the cell surface can effectively limit internalization of pretargeted nanoparticles. Our work underscores the need to carefully assess specific cell-pretargeting molecule pairs for applications requiring intracellular delivery, and the key design requirements for such bispecific pretargeting molecules.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Bispecific', '*Intracellular delivery', '*Pretargeting']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is commonly believed that for extramedullary involvement of ALL in sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system (CNS), TBI shall not be abandoned. In this study, the outcomes of pediatric ALL patients with CNS involvement (CNS(+)) and without CNS involvement (CNS(-)) treated with TBI-free allogeneic HSCT were retrospectively compared. The patients received a TBI-free busulfan plus cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen. Comparing CNS(+) (n = 27) and CNS(-) (n = 134) patients, the 5-year probabilities of relapse (44.4% versus 41.8%; P = .799), disease-free survival (DFS; 48.1% versus 43.3%; P = .642) and overall survival (OS; 51.9% versus 47.0%; P = .646) were not significantly different. Although transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the CNS(-) patients, the difference between the 2 groups was not significant (3.7% versus 12.7%; P = .177). In multivariate analysis, there were no significant between-group differences in OS (P = .502), DFS (P = .424), relapse rate (P = .226), or TRM (P = .117). These findings suggest that HSCT using a non-TBI-containing conditioning regimen can lead to similar outcomes in pediatric ALL patients with and without CNS involvement. TBI-free allogeneic HSCT might be feasible and effective for CNS(+) ALL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 15.,"INTRODUCTION: Synchronous involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) at the diagnosis of systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is associated with an increased risk for relapse despite complete remission to initial therapy. High-dose chemotherapy with a CNS-directed conditioning regimen followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) holds promise as a consolidative approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with systemic B-cell NHL and synchronous CNS involvement who received upfront consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ASCT while in first complete remission between July 2008 and June 2016 at 2 partner academic institutions. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified through the transplant database. The median age at diagnosis was 53 years (range, 37-65 years). The majority had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma histology (n = 17; 85%). The sites of CNS involvement were parenchymal (n = 12; 60%) and leptomeningeal disease (n = 9; 45%). All patients received systemic and CNS-directed therapy prior to transplant, with the most common approaches being R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone) (n = 13; 65%) and high-dose intravenous methotrexate (n = 16; 80%), respectively. With a median follow up of 4.4 years after ASCT (range, 2 months-8.5 years), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of 4-year progression-free and overall survival were 77% (95% confidence interval, 48%-91%) and 82% (95% confidence interval, 54%-94%), respectively. CONCLUSION: CNS-directed high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT provides durable remission for patients with synchronous aggressive lymphoma and should be strongly considered as consolidative therapy for eligible patients with systemic NHL with CNS involvement in first complete remission.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a cancer of the hematopoietic system initiated by a single genetic mutation which results in the oncogenic fusion protein Bcr-Abl. Untreated, patients pass through different phases of the disease beginning with the rather asymptomatic chronic phase and ultimately culminating into blast crisis, an acute leukemia resembling phase with a very high mortality. Although many processes underlying the chronic phase are well understood, the exact mechanisms of disease progression to blast crisis are not yet revealed. In this paper we develop a mathematical model of CML based on causal Bayesian networks in order to study possible disease progression mechanisms. Our results indicate that an increase of Bcr-Abl levels alone is not sufficient to explain the phenotype of blast crisis and that secondary changes such as additional mutations are necessary to explain disease progression and the poor therapy response of patients in blast crisis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,"BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes are characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis. Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel fusion protein that blocks transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) superfamily inhibitors of erythropoiesis, giving rise to a promising new investigative therapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with anaemia due to lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, dose-finding study (PACE-MDS), with long-term extension, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (white blood cell count <13 000/muL), and had anaemia with or without red blood cell transfusion support. Enrolled patients were classified as having low transfusion burden, defined as requiring less than 4 red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment (and baseline haemoglobin <10 g/dL), or high transfusion burden, defined as requiring 4 or more red blood cell units in the 8 weeks before treatment. Patients received luspatercept subcutaneously once every 21 days at dose concentrations ranging from 0.125 mg/kg to 1.75 mg/kg bodyweight for five doses (over a maximum of 12 weeks). Patients in the expansion cohort were treated with 1.0 mg/kg luspatercept; dose titration up to 1.75 mg/kg was allowed, and patients could be treated with luspatercept for a maximum of 5 years. Patients in the base study were assessed for response and safety after 12 weeks in order to be considered for enrolment into the extension study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving modified International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E), defined as a haemoglobin concentration increase of 1.5 g/dL or higher from baseline for 14 days or longer in low transfusion burden patients, and a reduction in red blood cell transfusion of 4 or more red blood cell units or a 50% or higher reduction in red blood cell units over 8 weeks versus pre-treatment transfusion burden in high transfusion burden patients. Patient data were subcategorised by: luspatercept dose concentrations (0.125-0.5 mg/kg vs 0.75-1.75 mg/kg); pre-study transfusion burden (high transfusion burden vs low transfusion burden, defined as >/=4 vs <4 red blood cell units per 8 weeks); pre-study serum erythropoietin concentration (<200 IU/L, 200-500 IU/L, and >500 IU/L); presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts; and presence of SF3B1 mutations. Efficacy analyses were carried out on the efficacy evaluable and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is currently ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01749514 and NCT02268383. FINDINGS: Between Jan 21, 2013, and Feb 12, 2015, 58 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were enrolled in the 12 week base study at nine treatment centres in Germany; 27 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts (0.125-1.75 mg/kg) and 31 patients in the expansion cohort (1.0-1.75 mg/kg). 32 (63% [95% CI 48-76]) of 51 patients receiving higher dose luspatercept concentrations (0.75-1.75 mg/kg) achieved HI-E versus two (22% [95% CI 3-60]) of nine receiving lower dose concentrations (0.125-0.5 mg/kg). Three treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: myalgia (one [2%]), increased blast cell count (one [2%]), and general physical health deterioration (one [2%]). Two of these treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reversible serious grade 3 adverse events: one patient (2%) had myalgia and one patient (2%) had general physical health deterioration. INTERPRETATION: Luspatercept was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of anaemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and so could therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of anaemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes; further studies are ongoing.

Therefore, the ameliorative characteristics of Ajuga bracteosa were studied. METHODS: Total phenolic content, flavonoid content, antioxidant capacity, reducing power and free-radical scavenging activity were determined colorimetrically. Specific polyphenols were quantified by RP-HPLC analysis. Preliminary cytotoxicity was tested using brine shrimp lethality assay while antiproliferative activity against THP-1 and Hep-G2 cell lines was determined by MTT and SRB protocols respectively. Antileishmanial potential was assessed via MTT colorimetric method. To investigate antidiabetic prospect, alpha-amylase inhibition assay was adopted whereas disc diffusion method was used to detect likely protein kinase inhibitory, antibacterial and antifungal activities. RESULTS: Among fifteen different extracts, maximum total phenolic content (10.75 +/- 0.70 mug GAE/mg DW), total reducing power (23.90 +/- 0.70 mug AAE/mg DW) and total antioxidant capacity (11.30 +/- 0.80 mug AAE/mg DW) were exhibited by methanol extract with superlative percent extract recovery (17.50 +/- 0.80% w/w). Chloroform-methanol extract demonstrated maximum flavonoid content (4.10 +/- 0.40 mug QE/mg DW) and ethanol extract exhibited greatest radical scavenging activity (IC50 14.40 +/- 0.20 mug/ml). RP-HPLC based quantification confirmed polyphenols such as pyrocatechol, gallic acid, resorcinol, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, coumarin, sinapinic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol. The brine shrimp lethality assay ranked 78.60% extracts as cytotoxic (LC50 </= 250 mug/ml) whereas significant THP-1 inhibition was shown by methanol-acetone extract (IC50 4.70 +/- 0.43 mug/ml). The antiproliferative activity against Hep-G2 hepatoma cancer cell line was demonstrated by n-hexane, ethylacetate and methanol-distilled water (IC50 8.65-8.95 mug/ml) extracts. Methanol extract displayed prominent protein kinase inhibitory activity (MIC 12.5 mug/disc) while n-hexane extract revealed remarkable antileishmanial activity (IC50 4.69 +/- 0.01 mug/ml). The antidiabetic potential was confirmed by n-hexane extract (44.70 +/- 0.30% alpha-amylase inhibition at 200 mug/ml concentration) while a moderate antibacterial and antifungal activities were unveiled. CONCLUSION: The variation in biological spectrum resulted due to use of multiple solvent systems for extraction. We also deduce that the valuable information gathered can be utilized for discovery of anticancer, antileishmanial, antioxidant and antidiabetic bioactive lead candidates.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Ajuga Bracteosa', 'Antiproliferative activity', 'Hep G2 hepatoma cell line', 'Leishmania tropica', 'Protein kinase inhibition', 'THP-1 human leukemia cell line']",PMC5583766,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The present study was designed to investigate the expression of multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes, verify the synergistic effects of baicalin and Adriamycin (ADM) and investigate the related mechanisms in ADM-resistant leukaemic HL-60/ADM cells. METHODS: We used a HL-60/ADM cell line. Cytotoxicity and flow cytometry assays were employed to verify the cytotoxic effects of baicalin. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assays were used to assess the expression of MDR-related genes and the changes in gene expression (both MDR-related and PI3K/Akt pathway-related) induced by administration of baicalin. RESULTS: We found that only multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), lung resistance-related protein (LRP) and Bcl-2 genes were expressed in both HL-60 and HL-60/ADM cells. HL-60/ADM cells exhibited significantly higher expression (p < 0.05). We also observed that low-dose baicalin (5 and 10 micromol/L) can induce growth inhibition and apoptotic effects on HL-60/ADM cells by increasing the intracellular accumulation of ADM. The synergistic effect of baicalin and ADM was verified. Concerning the potential mechanisms involved in this process, we showed that baicalin down-regulated the expression of several MDR-related and PI3K/Akt pathway-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the increased expression of MRP1, LRP and Bcl-2 genes in HL-60/ADM cells compared to regular HL-60 cells, which are recommended for future investigation on MDR. The present study provided evidence of the synergistic effect of baicalin and ADM in HL-60/ADM cells. Therefore, baicalin may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent against resistant leukaemia. Suppression of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, followed by inhibition of the expression of MDR-related genes may be a common mechanism in combination treatments with ADM for the reduction of resistance to ADM.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s).

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"BACKGROUND: The Hypermethylation of Ras association domain family (RASSF) often plays a key role in malignant progression of solid tumors; however, their impact on the prognosis and survival of adult ALL patients remain elusive. METHODS: The frequency of the promoter methylation pattern of RASSF6 and RASSF10 were analyzed in the peripheral blood (PB) samples taken at the time of diagnosis of 45 ALL patients. The methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay was used to detect the DNA methylation patterns. RESULTS: RASSF6 was frequently hypermethylated in patients diagnosed with pre-B-ALL (90.9%) and B-ALL (87.5%), followed by T-ALL (66.7%); whereas, RASSF10 methylation was more confined to T-ALL (80%) as compared to B-ALL (25%) and pre-B ALL (9.1%) patients. Moreover, hypermethylation of RASSF6 was significantly associated with a poor prognosis and shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with pre-B-ALL (log-rank test; P=0.041). CONCLUSION: RASSF6 and RASSF10 were frequently hypermethylated in the samples at the time of diagnosis of adult ALL patients. Our study represents the first report of methylation of RASSF6 at a high frequency in patients with pre-B ALL. Furthermore, hypermethylation of RASSF6 was significantly associated with inferior overall survival in pre-B ALL patients. It may suggest that the frequent epigenetic inactivation of RASSF6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of pre-B-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed outcomes in 301 newly diagnosed AML patients treated from 2004-2013 with cytarabine, anthracycline, and etoposide TST induction. Median age was 52 (range 20-74) and complete remission rate 68%. With median follow-up 5.8 years, 5-year DFS and overall survival (OS) were 37% (95% CI 31-45%) and 32% (95% CI 27-38%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, older age, unfavorable cytogenetics, and WBC>/=50x10(9)/L resulted in worse OS. Among patients not undergoing blood and marrow transplant, a propensity score analysis, which reduces imbalance in baseline characteristics, showed consolidation with TST compared with 1 or more cycles high-dose cytarabine trended toward lower DFS and post-remission survival with hazard ratio (HR) 1.9 (95% CI 0.9-4.0), and 1.6 (95% CI 0.7-3.6), respectively.

Runx1-deficient mice die during early embryogenesis due to the inability to establish definitive hematopoiesis. Here, we have used human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as model to study the role of RUNX1 in human embryonic hematopoiesis. Although the three RUNX1 isoforms a, b, and c were induced in CD45+ hematopoietic cells, RUNX1c was the only isoform induced in hematoendothelial progenitors (HEPs)/hemogenic endothelium. Constitutive expression of RUNX1c in human embryonic stem cells enhanced the appearance of HEPs, including hemogenic (CD43+) HEPs and promoted subsequent differentiation into blood cells. Conversely, specific deletion of RUNX1c dramatically reduced the generation of hematopoietic cells from HEPs, indicating that RUNX1c is a master regulator of human hematopoietic development. Gene expression profiling of HEPs revealed a RUNX1c-induced proinflammatory molecular signature, supporting previous studies demonstrating proinflammatory signaling as a regulator of HSC emergence.

Rarely, nonuremic calciphylaxis (NUC) may occur; in this context, a strongly supportive histology is crucial in establishing the diagnosis. Herein, we describe 2 cases of NUC associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like changes, identified in both initial nondiagnostic and subsequent diagnostic biopsy specimens.

Epub 2017 Sep 4.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) outcomes data of older AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients are limited. We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients 60 years old with AML/MDS who underwent AHSCT between January 2005 and December 2014. The primary objectives were to determine nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1 year post AHSCT. A total of 159 patients underwent AHSCT with a median age of 64 (range, 60-75) years. Of these, 103 patients (65%) had AML and 56 patients (35%) had MDS. At 1 year post AHSCT, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD occurred in 20.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 14.9-27.5%) and 54.1% (95% CI, 46.0-61.5%) of patients, respectively. NRM, RFS, relapse rate and OS at 1 year post AHSCT were 25.3% (95% CI, 18.8-32.3%), 53.3% (95% CI, 46.1-61.7%), 21.4% (95% CI, 15.4-28.1%) and 56.4% (95% CI, 49.2-54.7%), respectively. High disease risk index was associated with poor RFS, OS and higher relapse rate (P<0.03), whereas non-thymoglobulin-based GvHD prophylaxis, higher comorbidity index (3) and MDS were associated with higher NRM (P<0.03). Importantly, age did not have an adverse effect on NRM, relapse, RFS and OS. AHSCT was well tolerated. Hence, older age alone should not be considered a contraindication to AHSCT.",,,,PMC6857174,['P30 CA022453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1057384'],,,,,,,

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A teenage patient with AML, previously treated with multiple courses of systemic chemotherapy, radiation, and bone marrow transplant, presented with acute vision loss. Ophthalmic workup revealed a large, unilateral, bullous, serous retinal detachment. Ultimately, he underwent subretinal fluid biopsy, which was found to be positive for leukemic blast cells. Cytologic markers matched his initial bone marrow biopsy, and therefore were diagnostic of extramedullary AML relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia can cause various ophthalmic manifestations. Autopsy studies suggest that choroidal infiltration is relatively common, but clinical progression to serous retinal detachment is quite uncommon. Furthermore, serous retinal detachment is generally shallow, posterior, and much more often reported in acute lymphocytic leukemia. The ophthalmologist plays a critical role in identifying leukemic ocular involvement. This case demonstrates the potential for ocular biopsy to secure the diagnosis of extramedullary relapse in order to initiate prompt treatment and systemic workup.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chloroma', 'Granulocytic sarcoma', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemic choroidal infiltration', 'Retinal detachment']",PMC5566763,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 18.,"Effects of tobacco smoke on hematologic derangements have received little attention. This study employed a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure to explore the effects on bone marrow niche function. While lung cancer is the most widely studied consequence of tobacco smoke exposure, other malignancies, including leukemia, are associated with tobacco smoke exposure. Animals received cigarette smoke exposure for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 9 months. Results reveal that the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool size is reduced by cigarette smoke exposure. We next examined the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on one supporting cell type of the niche, the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Smoke exposure decreased the number of MSCs. Transplantation of naive HSPCs into irradiated mice with cigarette smoke exposure yielded fewer numbers of engrafted HSPCs. This result suggests that smoke-exposed mice possess dysfunctional niches, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis. Co-culture experiments using MSCs isolated from control or cigarette smoke-exposed mice with naive HSPCs in vitro showed that MSCs from cigarette smoke-exposed mice generated marked expansion of naive HSPCs.

A diagnosis of this type of leukaemia is considered in cases expressing CD56 along with immature T-cell-associated markers such as CD2 and CD7 with absence of B-cell and myeloid markers; in addition, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell leukaemia should be excluded. Prior to 2008, these precursor NK cell lymphoblastic leukaemias/lymphomas were categorized as myeloid/NK cell acute leukaemia with a phenotype identical to acute myeloid leukaemia with minimal differentiation. While the new classification has merit in having excluded myeloid expression, there is still persistent confusion in the literature and on a practical level with regard to precursor NK cell neoplasms. There is a paucity of recent case reports in the literature after the new WHO classification of this neoplasm. Due to the rarity of this neoplasm, an accurate pathological diagnosis is often difficult. In this article, we describe a case of precursor NK cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma presenting with unique morphological features and conflicting immunophenotypes. We also review all case reports of this neoplasm after the WHO 2008 classification.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Haematopoietic tumour', 'Natural killer cell', 'Natural killer cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma']",PMC5567073,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a compound, BC54, that is a selective inhibitor of enzymes from the cAMP-specific PDE4 and PDE7 families. Consistent with the biological effect of other PDE4 and PDE7 inhibitors, BC54 displays potent anti-inflammatory properties and is superior to a combination of rolipram (a PDE4 inhibitor) and BRL50481 (a PDE7A inhibitor) for inducing apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We further exploited PKA-regulated growth phenotypes in fission yeast to isolate two mutant alleles of the human PDE4B2 gene that encode enzymes possessing single amino acid changes that confer partial resistance to BC54. We confirm this resistance to both BC54 and rolipram via yeast-based assays and, for PDE4B2(T407A), in vitro enzyme assays. Thus, we are able to use this system for both chemical screens to identify biologically-active PDE inhibitors and molecular genetic studies to characterize the interaction of these molecules with their target enzymes. Based on its potency, selectivity, and effectiveness in cell culture, BC54 should be a useful tool to study biological processes regulated by PDE4 and PDE7 enzymes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of quinacrine on human leukemia U937 cells. Quinacrine-induced apoptosis of U937 cells was accompanied with ROS generation, mitochondrial depolarization, and BAX upregulation. Quinacrine-treated U937 cells showed ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation, which in turn upregulated FOXP3 transcription. FOXP3-mediated miR-183 expression decreased beta-TrCP mRNA stability and suppressed beta-TrCP-mediated SP1 degradation, thus increasing SP1 expression in U937 cells. Upregulated SP1 expression further increased BAX expression. BAX knock-down attenuated quinacrine-induced mitochondrial depolarization and increased the viability of quinacrine-treated cells. Together, our data indicate that quinacrine-induced apoptosis of U937 cells is mediated by mitochondrial alterations triggered by FOXP3/miR-183/beta-TrCP/SP1 axis-mediated BAX upregulation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated a key role for the transcription factor SALL4 in spermatogonial differentiation. However, whether SALL4 has broader roles within spermatogonia remains unclear despite its ability to co-regulate genes with PLZF, a transcription factor required for undifferentiated cell maintenance. Through development of inducible knockout models, we show that short-term integrity of differentiating but not undifferentiated populations requires SALL4. However, SALL4 loss was associated with long-term functional decline of undifferentiated spermatogonia and disrupted stem cell-driven regeneration. Mechanistically, SALL4 associated with the NuRD co-repressor and repressed expression of the tumor suppressor genes Foxl1 and Dusp4. Aberrant Foxl1 activation inhibited undifferentiated cell growth and survival, while DUSP4 suppressed self-renewal pathways. We therefore uncover an essential role for SALL4 in maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonial activity and identify regulatory pathways critical for germline stem cell function.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is the malignant accumulation of progenitors of the megakaryocyte lineage that normally produce blood platelets. AMKL is diagnosed de novo, in patients showing a poor prognosis, or in Down syndrome (DS) patients with a better prognosis. Recent data show that de novo AMKL is primarily associated with chromosomal alterations leading to the expression of fusions between transcriptional regulators.

Pulmonary involvement is uncommon in AML during the course of the disease and is usually caused by infection, haemorrhage, leukaemic pulmonary infiltrates and leukostasis. Lung localization of AML is very uncommon and potentially life threatening if not diagnosed and treated rapidly. The authors describe the sudden death of an asymptomatic five-month-infant because of a misdiagnosed lung localization of AML. Autopsy examination followed by histopathological studies showed an extensive leukostasis and extramedullary leukaemic infiltrating the lungs. Special stains and immunohistochemical studies revealed findings consistent with acute myelogenous leukaemia. This case suggests that underlying acute leukaemia should be considered as a cause of flu-like symptoms in infants.

Thus, there is a need for thorough characterization of their potential health risks, including allergenicity. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize similarities in allergenic potential of cyanobacteria originating from the major ecological environments. Different cyanobacterial taxa were tested for immunoreactivity with IgE from allergic donors and non-allergic controls using immunoblot and ELISA. Moreover, mediator release from human FcepsilonR1-transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells was measured, allowing in situ examination of the allergenic reaction. Phycocyanin content and IgE-binding potential were determined and inhibition assays performed to evaluate similarities in IgE-binding epitopes. Mass spectrometry analysis identified IgE-reactive bands ranging between 10 and 160kDa as phycobiliprotein compounds. Levels of cyanobacterial antigen-specific IgE in plasma of allergic donors and mediator release from sensitized RBL cells were significantly higher compared to non-allergic controls (p<0.01). Inhibition studies indicated cross-reactivity between IgE-binding proteins from fresh water cyanobacteria and phycocyanin standard. We further addressed IgE-binding characteristics of marine water and soil-originated cyanobacteria. Altogether, our data suggest that the intensive use and the strong increase in cyanobacterial abundance due to climate change call for increasing awareness and further monitoring of their potential health hazards.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, splicing fine-tunes the transcriptome output for highly individual outcomes at different stages of cell development, in specific timeframes, which when perturbed result in significant human diseases. Granulopoiesis provides a particularly well studied example of how splicing can be a highly flexible but tightly regulated process. Focusing on the specific case of granulopoiesis, this review surveys the contribution of cis-splicing variations in individual genes and the trans-regulation of global splicing outcomes during the normal development of neutrophils.

We performed thorough genomic characterization of 35 CRLF2-r cases (P2RY8-CRLF2 n = 18; IGH-CRLF2 n = 17). Activating JAK2 mutations were present in 34% of patients, and a CRLF2-F232C mutation was identified in an additional 17%. IKZF1 deletions were detected in 63% of cases. The majority of patients (26/35) classified as Ph-like, and these were characterized by significantly higher levels of MUC4, GPR110 and IL2RA/CD25. In addition, Ph-like CRLF2-r samples were significantly enriched for IKZF1 deletions, JAK2/CRLF2 mutations and increased expression of JAK/STAT target genes (CISH, SOCS1), suggesting that mutation-driven CRLF2/JAK2 activation is more frequent in this sub-group. Less is known about the genomics of CRLF2-r cases lacking JAK2-pathway mutations, but KRAS/NRAS mutations were identified in 4/9 non-Ph-like samples. This work highlights the heterogeneity of secondary lesions which may arise and influence intracellular-pathway activation in CRLF2-r patients, and importantly presents distinct therapeutic targets within a group of patients harboring identical primary translocations, for whom efficient directed therapies are currently lacking.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice as a model of genetic neutrophil deficiency, we investigated the contribution of neutrophils to stroke pathophysiology. Myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and infarct size was assessed by MRI after 24h reperfusion. Immune cell mobilization and infiltration was assessed by flow cytometry. We found that myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice had significantly reduced infarct size when compared to heterozygous and wild type control mice (MyMcl1(+/+): 78.0mm(3); MyMcl1(+/-): 83.4mm(3); MyMcl1(-/-): 55.1mm(3)). This was accompanied by a nearly complete absence of neutrophils in the ischemic hemisphere of myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice. Although myeloid Mcl1 knockout mice were protected from cerebral infarction, no significant differences in neurological deficit or the mRNA expression of inflammatory genes (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and MCP1) were detected. Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis using CXCR2 pepducin treatment partially reduced neutrophil mobilization and recruitment to the brain after stroke, but did not reduce infarct size 24h after transient MCA occlusion. These data confirm that neutrophils have an important role in infarct development during stroke pathophysiology, and suggest that complete deficiency, but not partial inhibition, is necessary to prevent neutrophil-mediated injury during stroke.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to identify chemokine-related transcripts that could be involved in the early stages of diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation. METHODS: We used immunoblot, PCR array, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence staining, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and determination of general metabolic parameters to evaluate markers of inflammation, body mass variation, and glucose tolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet. RESULTS: Using a real-time PCR array, we identified leukemia inhibitory factor as a chemokine/cytokine undergoing a rapid increase in the hypothalamus of obesity-resistant and a rapid decrease in the hypothalamus of obesity-prone mice fed a high-fat diet for 1 day. We hypothesized that the increased hypothalamic expression of leukemia inhibitory factor could contribute to the protective phenotype of obesity-resistant mice. To test this hypothesis, we immunoneutralized hypothalamic leukemia inhibitory factor and evaluated inflammatory and metabolic parameters. The immunoneutralization of leukemia inhibitory factor in the hypothalamus of obesity-resistant mice resulted in increased body mass gain and increased adiposity. Body mass gain was mostly due to increased caloric intake and reduced spontaneous physical activity. This modification in the phenotype was accompanied by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hypothalamus. In addition, the inhibition of hypothalamic leukemia inhibitory factor was accompanied by glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Hypothalamic expression of leukemia inhibitory factor may protect mice from the development of diet-induced obesity; the inhibition of this protein in the hypothalamus transforms obesity-resistant into obesity-prone mice.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose tissue', 'Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin']",PMC5581454,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sweroside (SWE), an iridoid glycoside, is isolated from Lonicera japonIca. It has diverse biological activities, but little is known in human leukemia. Here, our study showed the potential of sweroside as an effective agent against human leukemia using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Sweroside treatment obviously reduced the cell viability in human leukemia cell lines and primary human leukemia cells. S and G2/M cell-cycle arrest were induced by sweroside, associated with the down-regulation of Cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), CDC2 and CDC25 as well as the up-regulation of p53 and p21. In addition, apoptosis was highly induced by sweroside both in vitro and in vivo through enhancement of cleaved Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribosyl) transferase (PARP). Consistently, anti-apoptotic molecule of B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was impeded by sweroside, while pro-apoptotic signal of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was elevated. In vivo, HL-60-bearing tumor growth was considerably inhibited by sweroside, which was related to proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction. Our study highlighted the therapeutic potential of sweroside, and provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of sweroside chemosensitization in human leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Defects in the cell growth and apoptotic pathways are responsible for both disease pathogenesis and treatment resistance. Therefore, pro-apoptotic agents are potential candidates for APL treatment. Kaempferol is a flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-tumor properties. This study was designed to investigate the cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and differentiation-inducing effects of kaempferol on HL-60 and NB4 leukemia cells. Resazurin assay was used to determine cell viability following treatment with kaempferol (12.5-100 muM) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; 10 muM; used as a positive control). Apoptosis and differentiation were also detected using propidium iodide and NBT staining techniques, respectively. Furthermore, the expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis (PI3 K, AKT, BCL2, BAX, p53, p21, PTEN, CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9), differentiation (PML-RAR and HDAC1), and multi-drug resistance (ABCB1 and ABCC1) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The protein expressions of Bax/Bcl2 and casp3 were confirmed using Western blot. The results showed that kaempferol decreased cell viability and increased subG1 population in the tested leukemic cells. This effect was associated with decreased expression of Akt, BCL2, ABCB1, and ABCC1 genes, while the expression of CASP3 and BAX/BCL-2 ratio were significantly increased at both gene and protein levels. Kaempferol promoted apoptosis and inhibited multidrug resistance in a concentration-dependent manner, without any differential effect on leukemic cells. In conclusion, this study suggested that kaempferol may be utilized as an appropriate alternative for ATRA in APL patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*MDR', '*apoptosis', '*differentiation', '*kaempferol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,"PCB19, a 2,2',6-trichlorinated biphenyl, is one of many non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs), which are ubiquitous pollutants. NDL-PCBs affect cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling by promoting Ca(2+) release from ryanodine receptor-sensitive Ca(2+) pools and inhibiting store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) from the extracellular space. However, NDL-PCB-mediated SOCE inhibition has only been demonstrated in PC12 cells, in which SOCE is thought to be mainly mediated by TRPC family channels. Here, we investigated the effect of PCB19 on SOCE using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, human leukemia T cell line Jurkat-T cells and human promyelocytoma HL-60 cells which are the cell lines that are previously demonstrated to mediate the most common form of SOCE solely by the intrinsic Orai channels. PCB19 reduced thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) influx after Ca(2+) pool depletion in HEK293 cells. SOCEs in HEK293, Jurkat T, HL-60 and PC12 cells showed distinct sensitivities to SOCE inhibitors such as Gd(3+) and ML-9; however, PCB19 also showed a common effect of inhibiting SOCEs in all cell lines. PCB19-mediated SOCE inhibition was confirmed by demonstrating the ability of PCB19 to inhibit the SOCE current but not the TRPM7 current. These results imply that PCB19 inhibits not only TRPC-mediated SOCE as in PC12 cells but also Orai-mediated SOCE as in many other cells including HEK293, Jurkat T and HL-60 cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Ca2+ signaling', 'NDL-PCB', 'Orai', 'PCB19', 'Polychlorinated biphenyl', 'Store-operated Ca2+ entry']",,"['2016M3C7A1905481/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2016R1A2B4006811/National Research Foundation of Korea', '520150351/Kangwon National University']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,"Eltrombopag (ELT) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist reported to decrease labile iron in leukemia cells. Here we examine the previously undescribed iron(III)-coordinating and cellular iron-mobilizing properties of ELT. We find a high binding constant for iron(III) (log beta2=35). Clinically achievable concentrations (1 microM) progressively mobilized cellular iron from hepatocyte, cardiomyocyte, and pancreatic cell lines, rapidly decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also restoring insulin secretion in pancreatic cells. Decrements in cellular ferritin paralleled total cellular iron removal, particularly in hepatocytes. Iron mobilization from cardiomyocytes exceeded that obtained with deferiprone, desferrioxamine, or deferasirox at similar iron-binding equivalents. When combined with these chelators, ELT enhanced cellular iron mobilization more than additive (synergistic) with deferasirox. Iron-binding speciation plots are consistent with ELT donating iron to deferasirox at clinically relevant concentrations. ELT scavenges iron citrate species faster than deferasirox, but rapidly donates the chelated iron to deferasirox, consistent with a shuttling mechanism. Shuttling is also suggested by enhanced cellular iron mobilization by ELT when combined with the otherwise ineffective extracellular hydroxypyridinone chelator, CP40. We conclude that ELT is a powerful iron chelator that decreases cellular iron and further enhances iron mobilization when combined with clinically available chelators.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,PMC6558288,"['107477/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'SGL010\\1018/Academy of Medical Sciences/United Kingdom']",,,,['EMS83313'],,,,,,,

We applied the Toronto consensus conference definitions for TRALI and possible TRALI. Two TRALI subgroups were considered: ""antibody positive"" when a donor has human leukocyte antigen (class I or II) and/or human neutrophil antigen antibodies and the recipient has cognate antigen, and ""antibody negative"" when immunological investigation is negative or not done. The analysis targeted 378 cases, divided into antibody-positive TRALI (n=75), antibody-negative TRALI (n=100), and possible TRALI (n=203). TRALI patients were younger and received more blood components than the general population of transfused patients. Moreover, we identified the following clinical conditions where patients seemed to be at higher risk to develop TRALI: postpartum hemorrhage, acute myeloid leukemia, liver transplantation, allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, polytrauma, and thrombotic microangiopathy. Policy measures intended to reduce antibody-positive TRALI were found effective for apheresis platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma but not for whole blood-derived platelet concentrates. The use of platelet additive solutions was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of TRALI following transfusion of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates but not following transfusion of apheresis platelets. Our data reinforce the concept that possible TRALI and TRALI, as defined in the Canadian consensus conference, share many characteristics. No specific policy measures are currently directed at mitigation of possible TRALI despite its impact on transfusion safety. Despite TRALI mitigation measures, the overall incidence of TRALI cases reported to the French Hemovigilance system was not significantly reduced. Therefore, additional research is needed to reduce, if not eradicate, all TRALI categories.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Activated NK cells (aNK) generated by expansion of a human interleukin-2-dependent NK cell line (NK-92) were shown to mediate strong anti-leukemia activity. This phase 1 study evaluated feasibility, safety, and activity of aNK cells adoptively transferred to patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, effects of these aNK cells on the patient's immune system were evaluated. METHODS: Two cell-dose levels (1 x 10(9) cells/m(2) and 3 x 10(9) cells/m(2)) were used. One treatment course consisted of two infusions of the same cell dose, each cell infusion delivered 24 h apart. The aNK cells were administered in the outpatient setting. RESULTS: Seven patients with refractory/relapsed AML were treated with a total of 20 aNK cell infusions. None of the 7 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities during the aNK cell administration or during 21 days of the post-infusion observation period. No grade 3-4 toxicities (probable or definite) related to aNK cell infusions occurred. Activity was transient in 3 of 7 patients. No significant changes in the patient's lymphocyte counts, subsets frequency, phenotype or activity were observed post-infusion. Cell dose-dependent effects in the plasma levels of several cytokines were observed. DISCUSSION: The trial demonstrated the safety and feasibility of adoptive cell therapy with ""off-the-shelf"" aNK cells in patients with refractory/relapsed AML.

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"Statins are well-known inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which block the mevalonate pathway. The activity of statins not only decreases cholesterol levels but also ameliorates inflammation and modulates the immune system. In this study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on histamine release using rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells, and examined its interaction with proteins involved in the exocytosis process. Treatment with simvastatin for 24h inhibited histamine release in RBL-2H3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner after stimulation with dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA, as an antigen), ionomycin (a calcium ion [Ca(2+)] ionophore), and thapsigargin (an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum). Simvastatin-induced inhibition was counteracted by co-administration of mevalonolactone or geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol. Indeed, several exocytotic proteins were post-translationally modified by isoprenylation, which is required for proper localization in the lipid membrane. RBL-2H3 cells express proteins involved in the fusion of granules and the plasma membrane, such as Ras-like protein in the brain 27a (Rab27a), synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP23), and vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7), as well as Ca(2+) binding proteins, such as double C2 alpha (Doc2a), synaptotagmin2, and mammalian uncoordinated13-4 (munc13-4). The interaction of Rab27a and Doc2a proteins was detected using proximity ligation assays. Antigen stimulation caused these proteins to interact, and this interaction could be disrupted by co-administration of simvastatin. In conclusion, simvastatin inhibited the mevalonate pathway, which suppressed the geranylgeranylation of Rab27a by depleting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and interfering with the Rab27a-Doc2a interaction. This activity resulted in the inhibition of exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the 2002 to 2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of acute leukemia. Admissions were classified as weekend or weekday admissions for comparison. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to analyze predictors of hospital mortality. RESULTS: There was a 22.3% decline in acute leukemia admissions in 2014 compared to 2002 and a 4% decline in in-hospital mortality (19.0%-14.9%; P < .001). A total of 82,833 admissions were included in the study, and 14,241 (17.19%) occurred over the weekend. Hospital mortality was higher for weekend than weekday admissions (18.8% vs. 16.1%; P < .001). Weekend admissions were less likely to undergo early bone marrow biopsy than their weekday counterparts (27.5% vs. 46.3%; P < .01). Bone marrow biopsy (adjusted odds ratio 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.39; P < .001) and admission to a teaching hospital (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.75; P < .001) independently predicted lower hospital mortality. Weekend admission was associated with higher hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12; 95 CI, 1.02-1.23; P = .01) and more complications (50.6% vs. 47.8%; P < .001) than weekday admissions.

For these patients, the achievement of complete remission appears crucial for them to be able to undergo allotransplantation, which might be the only possible treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the FLAG-Ida (fludarabine, cytarabine [cytosine arabinoside], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, idarubicin) regimen in patients with primary refractory/first relapse AML as a bridge to transplantation. We studied its efficacy in terms of overall response and overall survival to assess which variables (age, lactate dehydrogenase, bone marrow blast count, peripheral blood blast count, platelet count, white blood cell count, de novo or secondary AML, molecular-cytogenetic risk, duration of response, and relapsed or refractory disease) might have an effect on outcome. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 108 consecutive adult patients (52 males, 66 females; median age, 49 years; range, 17-72 years) with newly diagnosed AML refractory to standard induction regimens or relapse after first complete remission, who had received the FLAG-Ida protocol as salvage therapy from January 2005 to December 2015. An overall response was achieved in 48 patients (44%). On multivariate analysis, the variables with a positive effect on the response rate were molecular-cytogenetic risk (P = .009), duration of first response in relapsed AML (P = .003), AML status (relapsed or refractory; P = .047), and peripheral blood blast count (P = .016). On multivariate analysis, overall survival was significantly associated with FLAG-Ida response (hazard ratio, 0.343; P = .001) and receipt of allotransplantation (hazard ratio, 0.277; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our data seem to confirm the value of FLAG-Ida in this setting and might suggest its best usage as bridge therapy for patients awaiting allotransplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has not been extensively validated in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients. Speckle-tracking echocardiography is a sensitive method for the detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction. METHODS: Cardiac function was prospectively assessed in 80 patients (44 men; mean age, 45 +/- 11 years) after BMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute or chronic myeloid leukemia by means of various echocardiographic techniques. Before chemotherapy for BMT, 89% of the patients had previously been treated with anthracyclines. Patients had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS), subendocardial and subepicardial longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, LV twist, and right ventricular GLS were measured by speckle-tracking, and (2) three-dimensionally derived LVEF and right ventricular ejection fraction were also assessed. Abnormal LVEF was defined as <53%. Studies were performed before (baseline) and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after chemotherapy conditioning followed by BMT. RESULTS: Impaired LV GLS values were observed at 1 month after chemotherapy and at 3, 6, and 12 months compared with baseline (-20 +/- 2.2% at baseline, -18.4 +/- 2.1% at 1 month, -17.3 +/- 2.2% at 3 months, -17.1 +/- 2.1% at 6 months, and -17.1 +/- 2.2% at 12 months; P = .001). Early LV GLS changes were driven mostly by changes in subendocardial longitudinal strain (-22.5 +/- 2.4% at baseline, -20.5 +/- 2.3% at 1 month, -19.2 +/- 2.3% at 3 months, -19.2 +/- 2.4% at 6 months, and -19.1 +/- 2.4 at 12 months; P = .001), whereas significant subepicardial strain changes were observed at 3 months after BMT. Compared with baseline, right ventricular GLS was also impaired early after chemotherapy. Compared with baseline, LVEF was slightly reduced (P = .02) at the end of the follow-up. Among echocardiographic markers, LV GLS at 1 month had the strongest predictive value for abnormal LVEF (<53%) at 12 months (area under the curve 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96). A cutoff LV GLS value of -18.4% had sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 71.9% for the identification of abnormal LVEF at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In BMT patients, myocardial deformation analysis detected early and progressive subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Impaired LV GLS had predictive value for the detection of abnormal LVEF at 12-month follow-up. Thus, myocardial deformation study should be applied early after BMT to prevent irreversible cardiac dysfunction by appropriate treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society of Echocardiography.

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,"The hematopoietic system is well established as a paradigm for the study of cellular hierarchies, their disruption in disease and therapeutic use in regenerative medicine. Traditional approaches to study hematopoiesis involve purification of cell populations based on a small number of surface markers. However, such population-based analysis obscures underlying heterogeneity contained within any phenotypically defined cell population. This heterogeneity can only be resolved through single cell analysis. Recent advances in single cell techniques allow analysis of the genome, transcriptome, epigenome and proteome in single cells at an unprecedented scale. The application of these new single cell methods to investigate the hematopoietic system has led to paradigm shifts in our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in hematopoiesis and how this is disrupted in disease. In this review, we summarize how single cell techniques have been applied to the analysis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, with a particular focus on recent advances in single-cell genomics, including how these might be utilized for clinical application.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

We hypothesized that altered sIL-7Ralpha levels may cause adverse outcomes in patients undergoing HSCT. In parallel, we investigated the impact of the IL-7Ralpha SNP rs6897932, which has been associated with release of IL-7R. The sIL-7Ralpha levels decreased during HSCT (from 114ng/ml before to 48ng/ml at day +14 (P<0.0001)). This pattern was inversely mirrored by IL-7. The IL-7/sIL-7Ralpha ratio at day +14 was significantly higher in patients developing grades II-IV aGVHD (OR=4.3, P=0.026). Furthermore, donor carriage of the rs6897932 T allele was associated with reduced sIL-7Ralpha levels, increased risk of grades II-IV aGVHD (OR=2.4, P=0.055) and increased transplant-related mortality (CC=4.5%, CT=21.4% and TT=27.3%, P=0.0037).

This review highlights interacting etiologies contributing to development of secondary breast cancer to complement guidelines for surveillance and survivorship care and make recommendations for clinical practice. Treatment exposures determine Children's Oncology Group breast cancer surveillance guidelines; those treated with cumulative doses >/=20 Gy chest irradiation should undergo annual magnetic resonance imaging and mammography after age 25 years or 8 years after exposure, whichever comes last. Recent investigations suggest that those treated with cumulative doses >/=10 Gy in fields affecting breast tissue, specifically whole lung, should be counseled for similar surveillance. Childhood sarcoma and leukemia survivors treated with anthracyclines and/or alkylating agents without radiation have increased risk for breast cancer and may require enhanced surveillance. Multigene testing and/or genomic evaluation for predisposition among certain childhood cancer subtypes may prove to be beneficial in identifying those at greatest risk.

Adult-onset NIHID typically manifests with dementia associated with leukoencephalopathy. The detection of NIs in skin biopsies is useful for an antemortem diagnosis. A previous analysis suggested that NIs in NIHID originated from nuclear bodies (NBs), an important nuclear domain related to the ubiquitin-p62-mediated protein degradation system. In this study, we analyzed skin samples from 5 NIHID and 5 control cases immunohistochemically and electron microscopically. In the control cases, small but significant amounts of ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear structures were found. These structures were consistently colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), an essential component of NBs, in particular when activated. The p62- and PML-positive structures were more frequently found in NIHID cases. Activated NBs, having a core and a shell, were observed by electron microscopy in control but not in NIHID cases. Instead, immature and mature filamentous NIs were found only in the NIHID cases. Our results indicate that NBs could not be normally activated in the NIHID, and an abnormal alteration of NBs might be related to the pathogenesis of NIHID.","['(c) 2017 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 3.,"The discovery of novel anti-AML therapeutic agents is urgently needed, but the complex heterogeneity of the disease has so far hampered the development of a curative treatment. FLT3 inhibitors have shown therapeutic potential in clinical trials; but a monotherapy regimen has been associated with resistance mediated by the activation of parallel signalling circuitry, including MAPK and mTOR. Therefore, inhibiting a nexus of the two signalling pathways along with inhibition of FLT3 might be advantageous. Herein, we propose that a dual inhibition of FLT3 and Mnk would provide a better clinical option for AML patients compared to targeting FLT3 alone. Thus, a series of N-phenyl-4-(thiazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amines and 4-(indol-3-yl)-N-phenylpyrimidin-2-amines were prepared. Potent Mnk2 inhibitors, FLT3 inhibitors, and dual inhibitors of Mnk2 and FLT3 were identified and their anti-proliferative activities assessed against MV4-11 AML cell lines. Dual inhibition of FLT3 and Mnk2 caused the increased apoptotic cell death of MV4-11 cells compared to inhibition of FLT3 or Mnk2 alone.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"In multiple myeloma, despite recent improvements offered by new therapies, disease relapse and drug resistance still occur in the majority of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new drugs that can overcome drug resistance and prolong patient survival after failure of standard therapies. The imipridone ONC201 causes downstream inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling and has tumoricidal activity against a variety of tumor types, while its efficacy in preclinical models of myeloma remains unclear. In this study, we treated human myeloma cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells with ONC201. Treatment decreased cellular viability and induced apoptosis in myeloma cell lines, with IC50 values of 1 to 1.5 muM, even in those with high risk features or TP53 loss. ONC201 increased levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in myeloma cells, resulting from decreased phosphorylation of degradation-promoting Bim Ser69 by ERK1/2. In addition, myeloma cell lines made resistant to several standard-of-care agents (by chronic exposure) were equally sensitive to ONC201 as their drug-naive counterparts, and combinations of ONC201 with proteasome inhibitors had synergistic anti-myeloma activity.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are replicationally quiescent mature B-cells. In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis, in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow-derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P = .004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with M2-10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of ribonucleotide pools showed a significant two-fold increase in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells, indicating that the stroma may induce CLL cellular bioenergy and the RNA building blocks necessary for the transcriptional requirement of a prosurvival phenotype. The stroma did not impact the proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of CLL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that short-term interaction (</=24 hours) with stroma increases OxPhos and bioenergy in replicationally quiescent CLL cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"The function of gene body DNA methylation in alternative splicing, and its relation to disease pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever (MEFV) encodes the pyrin protein and contains a 998 bp CpG island, covering the second exon, which is differentially methylated in FMF patients compared to healthy controls. Our further observation of increased exon 2-spliced MEFV transcript in leukocytes of FMF patients provoked us to test the role of exon methylation in alternative splicing using inflammatory cell culture models. First, in vitro exon methylation triggered an increased level of exon 2 exclusion using a splicing cassette in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). HL-60 cells subjected to methylating and demethylating agents, as well as cells differentiated to neutrophil-like cells, exhibited different levels of spliced/unspliced transcripts. We observed increased levels of spliced transcripts in neutrophil-like (p = 0.0005), activated (p = 0.0034) and methylated cells (p < 0.0001), whereas decreased levels in demethylated cells (p = 0.0126) compared to control untreated HL-60 cells. We also showed that the protein isoform of pyrin lacking the exon 2 has an adverse subcellular localization in neutrophil-like cells. Therefore, it remains in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. This may point to an epigenetic involvement in an important inflammatory gene.",,,,PMC5596369,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed to understand whether pemetrexed plus cisplatin exerts a beneficial synergistic effect in human choroidal melanoma cells and to delineate the underlying molecular mechanism. To accomplish these aims, we treated choroidal melanoma cells with pemetrexed and cisplatin and assessed cell survival with SRB and MTT assays. Proteins were detected using western blotting analysis. NOXA and CHOP were knocked down with siRNA. We found that pemetrexed or cisplatin alone inhibited survival and induced apoptosis in human choroidal melanoma cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of c-FLIP, an anti-apoptotic protein in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, were decreased by pemetrexed or cisplatin respectively, while the expression of a pro-apoptotic protein in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, NOXA, was up-regulated. Moreover, pemetrexed or cisplatin alone increased the protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers IRE1alpha, Bip and CHOP. Silencing CHOP expression reduced NOXA expression. These findings suggest that the pemetrexed or cisplatin induced intrinsic apoptosis via activation of the ER stress response. Importantly, combining the two compounds more strongly induced apoptosis. Following the cotreatment, CHOP and NOXA expression increased, while c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression decreased, and these effects were more pronounced than when using either compound alone. This result suggests that pemetrexed and cisplatin synergistically activate ER stress response-induced apoptosis in choroidal melanoma cells. To summarize, the c-FLIP and NOXA/Mcl-1 axis participated in the synergistic effect of pemetrexed plus cisplatin in human choroidal melanoma cells. Intrinsic apoptosis was induced via activation of the ER stress response. Our study provides important mechanistic insights into potential cancer treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and enriches our understanding of human choroidal melanoma.",,,,PMC5581197,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanism of immunity against CML-LSCs is not fully understood. We have identified a novel immune target, CXorf48, expressed in LSCs of CML patients. Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) induced by the epitope peptide derived from CXorf48 recognized CD34(+)CD38(-) cells obtained from the bone marrow of CML patients. We detected CXorf48-specific CTLs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CML patients who have discontinued imatinib after maintaining complete molecular remission for more than 2 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study was carried out comprising of 90 cases; (30 ameloblastoma, 30 keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), and 30 radicular cyst). Bcl-2 expression was determined with respect to localization, area (percentage) and intensity of stained cells in epithelium, and connective tissue stroma by counting the endothelial, round, and fusiform cells. RESULTS: In epithelium bcl-2 expression in KCOTs was higher followed by ameloblastoma and lowest in the radicular cyst. Whereas, in connective tissue stroma bcl-2 expression was higher in KCOT and radicular cyst than ameloblastoma cases. Solid variants showed statistically higher expression as compared to the unicystic variants of ameloblastoma (P = 0.009, 0.033, 0.011, and 0.041). CONCLUSION: High expression of bcl-2 in KCOT supports the general agreement that some features of KCOT are those of a neoplasia. The bcl-2 expression in connective tissue cells suggests that these cells may also be important as epithelial cells in the biological behavior odontogenic keratocyst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation therapy by agents such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2 VD3) represents a useful approach for the treatment of cancer including acute myeloid leukemia. Human myeloid leukemia cell lines are induced to terminal differentiation into monocyte lineage by 1,25-(OH)2 VD3. However, usage of these findings in the clinical trials is limited by calcemic effects of 1,25-(OH)2 VD3. Attempts to overcome this problem have focused on a combination of low concentrations 1,25-(OH)2 VD3 with other compounds to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells. In this study, the effect of honey bee venom (BV) and 1,25-(OH)2 VD3, individually and in combination, on proliferation and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells were assayed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, toxic and nontoxic concentrations of BV and 1,25-(OH)2 VD3 were tested using Trypan blue stained cell counting and (3[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In addition, differentiation of cells was assayed using a Wright-Giemsa staining and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of the variance test using SPSS software. RESULTS: Our findings showed that both the BV and 1,25-(OH)2 VD3, in a dose and time-dependent manner, caused cell death at high concentrations and inhibited cell proliferation at lower concentrations. About 5 nM of 1,25-(OH)2 VD3 induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to monocytes after 72 h. 2.5 mug/ml of BV suppressed proliferation of HL-60 cells but had not any effects on their differentiation, whereas in combination with 5 nM of 1,25-(OH)2 VD3, it enhanced antiproliferative and differentiation potency of 1,25-(OH)2 VD3. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that BV potentiates the 1,25-(OH)2 VD3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation into monocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,"Cells directly probe and respond to the physicomechanical properties of their extracellular environment, a dynamic process which has been shown to play a key role in regulating both cellular adhesive processes and differential cellular function. Recent studies indicate that stem cells show lineage-specific differentiation when cultured on substrates approximating the stiffness profiles of specific tissues. Although tissues are associated with a range of Young's modulus values for bulk rigidity, at the subcellular level, tissues are comprised of heterogeneous distributions of rigidity. Lithographic processes have been widely explored in cell biology for the generation of analytical substrates to probe cellular physicomechanical responses. In this work, it is shown for the first time that that direct-write e-beam exposure can significantly alter the rigidity of elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates and a new class of 2D elastomeric substrates with controlled patterned rigidity ranging from the micrometer to the nanoscale is described. The mechanoresponse of human mesenchymal stem cells to e-beam patterned substrates was subsequently probed in vitro and significant modulation of focal adhesion formation and osteochondral lineage commitment was observed as a function of both feature diameter and rigidity, establishing the groundwork for a new generation of biomimetic material interfaces.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the long non-coding RNA, SNHG5 on imatinib resistance in CML and explored the underlying mechanisms. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that SNHG5 and ABCC2 expressions were up-regulated in the isolated peripheral blood cells of the CML patients when compared with healthy controls, and SNHG5 expression levels was positively correlated with ABCC2 in CML patients. In vitro studies showed that the expressions of SNHG5 and ABCC2 were up-regulated in imatinib resistant cells (K562-R) when compared to K562 cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed the interaction between SNHG5 and miR-205-5p, which was further confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immune-precipitation in K562 cells. Overexpression of SNHG5 suppressed the expression of miR-205-5p and the expression of SNHG5 was negatively correlated with the miR-205-5p expression in CML patients. In addition, ABCC2 was predicted as a downstream target of miR-205-5p, which was further confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay in K562-R cells, and overexpression of miR-205-5p suppressed the expression of ABCC2 in K562-R cells. In vitro functional assay showed that overexpression of SNHG5 in K562 cells increased imatinib resistance and knock-down of SNHG5 reduced the imatinib resistance in K562-R cells.

Here we reported that Forkhead box C1 (FoxC1), a member of the forkhead family transcription factors, was up-regulated in EC tissues and cell lines in comparison with controls. FoxC1 levels were negatively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and survival status of EC patients. Knockdown of FoxC1 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EC cells, while overexpression of FoxC1 promoted these biological behaviors. Mechanically, serial deletion and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ZEB2, a well-reported transcriptional suppressor of E-cadherin, was a direct transcriptional target of FoxC1. Moreover, FoxC1 was recruited to the ZEB2 promoter by its interaction with the pioneer transcription factor pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1). Importantly, significant correlation between levels of FoxC1 and ZEB2 was observed in EC tissues and the two proteins could be used as prognostic biomarkers together. Hence, our results revealed a critical role of FoxC1 in the EMT process of EC and uncovered a novel mechanism for the regulation of ZEB2-E-cadherin axis in EC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Forkhead Box C1', 'ZEB2', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'esophageal cancer']",PMC5574937,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 31.,"OBJECTIVE: Xenotropic murine leukemia virus related virus (XMRV), is the first gammaretrovirus identified a decade ago, in human tissue bearing adenocarcinoma of prostate, followed by several researches documenting little or no prevalence of XMRV in prostate cancer samples. However, the status of XMRV within subtype of prostate adenocarcinoma has not been investigated yet. In this study, we investigated the relationship between XMRV and broad spectrum morphological entities of prostate adenocarcinoma, including acinar, ductal and other rare subtypes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prevalence of XMRV DNA in different histological subtypes of prostate adenocarcinoma was examined after characterizing the tumors into groups, using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from newly diagnosed prostate adenocarcinomas and archival prostate cancer tissue from our XMRV case control analysis. Broad-spectrum XMRV DNA amplification was performed by end-point polymerase chain reaction, using commercially available primer set. RESULTS: The study included 100 patients with prostate cancer. XMRV DNA was detected in 4 of 8 (50%) ductal adenocarcinomas, exhibiting papillary and cribriform histological features. XMRV DNA was not detected in any other variant of adenocarcinoma including acinar (0/91) and mucinous carcinomas (0/1). Majority of XMRV positive cases were biologically aggressive and present cancer at an early age upon diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Ductal adenocarcinomas demonstrate a significant association of XMRV DNA while other histological variants of prostate adenocarcinoma seem unrelated to XMRV infection.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acinar', 'XMRV', 'adenocarcinoma', 'ductal']",PMC5562243,,['Conflict of Interest: No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.'],,,,,,,,,,

To date, most of the previous studies of miR-124 in MDS have focused on epigenetic changes and little is known about the underlying mechanism through which miR-124 regulates CDK6 expression. RESULTS: In the present study, we employed pyrosequencing analysis to quantify the methylation levels of upstream regions of the miR-124 genes (miR-124-1, miR-124-2 and miR-124-3) in 56 primary MDS patients. We found the three miR-124 genes were methylated in MDS patients. Univariate analysis revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, marrow blast count, karyotype, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), mean corpuscular volume, as well as high methylation of miR-124-1, miR-124-2 and miR-124-3 were significantly related to overall survival. In leukaemia-free survival, patients who were older and had an advanced WHO classification, high marrow blast counts, high IPSS risk and high methylation of miR-124-1 and miR-124-2 progressed rapidly to acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high methylation of miR-124-3 was an independent factor of overall survival. Median survival of patients with high miR-124-3 methylation was significantly shorter (7.6 months) than patients with low methylation (32.7 months; P = 0.010). A functional study revealed that silencing of miR-124 resulted in upregulation of its target gene, cyclin dependent kinase CDK6, which in turn promoted cell proliferation in the MDS cell line SKM-1. CONCLUSIONS: High methylation of miR-124-3 predicts shorter survival for patients with MDS, which may be a useful prognostic marker in MDS.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*Methylation', '*Prognosis', '*Pyrosequencing', '*miR-124']",PMC5577794,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 14-year-old spayed female mixed breed dog was transferred to a veterinary medical teaching hospital for an immediate blood transfusion. The dog showed lethargy, pale mucous membranes, and a weak femoral pulse. Complete blood count revealed non-regenerative anemia and severe leukopenia with thrombocytopenia. ALL was tentatively diagnosed based on the predominance of immature lymphoblasts on blood film examination. For confirmation of lymphoid malignancy, PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) on a peripheral blood sample and flow cytometry analysis were performed after blood transfusion. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that lymphocyte subsets were of normal composition, but PARR detected a T-cell malignancy. The dog was diagnosed with ALL and survived 1 wk after diagnosis. In conclusion, after blood transfusion, flow cytometry was not a reliable diagnostic method for an ALL dog, whereas PARR could detect lymphoid malignancy. Our results suggest that PARR should be the first-line diagnostic tool to detect canine lymphoid malignancy after a blood transfusion.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Blood transfusion', 'Flow cytometry', 'Lymphoid malignancy', 'PARR']",PMC5577304,,['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aberrant RASSF1A promoter methylation levels were assessed in 226 newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients and 30 apparently healthy controls, by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Meanwhile, RASSF1A mRNA levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, hematological characteristics, cytogenetic abnormalities, and genetic aberrations were assessed. Finally, associations of RASSF1A hypermethylation with clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: RASSF1A hypermethylation was observed in 23.0% of patients with non-M3 AML (52/226), but not in controls. Meanwhile, hypermethylation of the RASSF1A promoter was significantly associated with ASXL1 mutation. Furthermore, the log-rank test revealed that RASSF1A hypermethylation indicated decreased relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-M3 AML (P=0.012 and P=0.014, respectively). In multivariate analysis, RASSF1A hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (P=0.040), but not for OS (P=0.060).

We conducted a large, multi-cohort clinical trial testing various doses and treatment schedules of pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pom/dex) in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Overall, 345 patients were enrolled to six cohorts based on number and type of prior lines of therapy, pomalidomide dose and schedule. Median prior lines of therapy were three with near universal prior exposure to proteasome inhibitors and/or immunomodulatory drugs. A confirmed response rate of 35% was noted for all cohorts (range 23-65%) with higher responses in cohorts with fewer prior lines of therapy. Median time to confirmed response was 2 months and the longest progression-free survival and overall survival seen in any cohort were 13.1 and 47.9 months, respectively. Observed adverse reactions were as expected, with myelosuppression and fatigue being the most common hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (AEs), respectively. Longer durations of treatment and response, higher response rates and fewer AEs were noted with the 2 mg pomalidomide dose. This is the longest follow-up data for Pom/dex in refractory multiple myeloma and will help shape the real-world utilization of this regimen.",,,,,['P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The main prerequisite for clinical efficacy of L-asparaginases is micromolar KM for asparagine to allow for complete depletion of this amino acid in the blood. Since currently approved L-asparaginases are of bacterial origin, immunogenicity is a challenge, which would be mitigated by a human enzyme. However, all human L-asparaginases have millimolar KM for asparagine. We recently identified the low KM guinea pig L-asparaginase (gpASNase1). Because gpASNase1 and human L-asparaginase 1 (hASNase1) share ~70% amino-acid identity, we decided to humanize gpASNase1 by generating chimeras with hASNase1 through DNA shuffling. To identify low KM chimeras we developed a suitable bacterial selection system (E. coli strain BW5Delta). Transforming BW5Delta with the shuffling libraries allowed for the identification of several low KM clones. To further humanize these clones, the C-terminal domain of gpASNase1 was replaced with that of hASNase1. Two of the identified clones, 63N-hC and 65N-hC, share respectively 85.7% and 87.1% identity with the hASNase1 but have a KM similar to gpASNase1. These clones possess 100-140 fold enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to hASNase1. Notably, we also show that these highly human-like L-asparaginases maintain their in vitro ALL killing potential.",,,,PMC5579231,"['I01 BX001919/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 EB013685/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the initial leukemic cells share the same antigen receptor gene rearrangements. However, due to ongoing rearrangement processes, leukemic cells with different gene rearrangement patterns can develop, resulting in subclone formation. We studied leukemic subclones and their distribution in the bone marrow and peripheral blood at diagnosis. Antigen receptor gene rearrangements (IGH, IGK, TRG, TRD, TRB) were analyzed by next-generation sequencing in seven paired bone marrow samples and five paired bone marrow-peripheral blood samples. Background-thresholds were defined, which enabled identification of leukemic gene rearrangements down to very low levels. Paired bone marrow analysis showed oligoclonality in all 7 patients and up to 34 leukemic clones per patient. Additional analysis of evolutionary-related IGH gene rearrangements revealed up to 171 leukemic clones per patient. Interestingly, overall 86% of all leukemic gene rearrangements, including small subclones, were present in both bone marrow samples (range per patient: 72-100%). Paired bone marrow-peripheral blood analysis showed that 83% of all leukemic gene rearrangements in bone marrow were also found in peripheral blood (range per patient: 81-100%). Remarkably, in the paired bone marrow samples and paired bone marrow-peripheral blood samples the vast majority of leukemic gene rearrangements had a similar frequency (<5-fold frequency difference) (96% and 96% of leukemic rearrangements, respectively). Together, these results indicate that B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia is generally highly oligoclonal. Nevertheless, the vast majority of leukemic clones, even the minor antigen receptor-defined subclones, are homogeneously distributed throughout the bone marrow and peripheral blood compartment.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5664391,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"IT-901 is a novel and selective NF-kappaB inhibitor with promising activity in pre-clinical models. Here we show that treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (CLL) with IT-901 effectively interrupts NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. CLL cells exposed to the drug display elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which damage mitochondria, limit oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, and activate intrinsic apoptosis. Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in stromal and myeloid cells, both tumor-supportive elements, fails to induce apoptosis, but impairs NF-kappaB-driven expression of molecules involved in cell-cell contacts and immune responses, essential elements in creating a pro-leukemic niche. The consequence is that accessory cells do not protect CLL cells from IT-901-induced apoptosis. In this context, IT-901 shows synergistic activity with ibrutinib, arguing in favor of combination strategies. IT-901 is also effective in primary cells from patients with Richter syndrome (RS).

A nationwide, population-based, chronic myeloid leukemia registry was analyzed to evaluate (deep) response rates to first and subsequent treatment lines and eligibility for a treatment cessation attempt in adults diagnosed between January 2008 and April 2013 in the Netherlands. The registry covered 457 patients; 434 in chronic phase (95%) and 15 (3%) in advanced disease phase. Seventy-five percent of the patients in chronic phase were treated with imatinib and 25% with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. At 3 years 44% of patients had discontinued their first-line treatment, mainly due to intolerance (21%) or treatment failure (19%). At 18 months 73% of patients had achieved a complete cytogenetic response and 63% a major molecular response. Deep molecular responses (MR(4.0) and MR(4.5)) were achieved in 69% and 56% of patients, respectively, at 48 months. All response milestones were achieved faster in patients treated upfront with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but ultimately patients initially treated with imatinib also reached similar levels of responses. The 6-year cumulative incidence of eligibility for a tyrosine kinase cessation attempt, according to EURO-SKI criteria, was 31%. Our findings show that in a 'real-world' setting the long-term outcome of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is excellent and the conditions for an attempt to stop tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy are met by a third of the patients.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,PMC5664388,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is constantly expressed in leukemic cells of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A T-cell receptor (TCR) that specifically reacts with WT1 peptide in the context of HLA-A*24:02 has been identified. We conducted a first-in-human trial of TCR-gene transduced T-cell (TCR-T-cell) transfer in patients with refractory acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and high-risk MDS to investigate the safety and cell kinetics of the T cells. The WT1-specific TCR-gene was transduced to T cells using a retroviral vector encoding small interfering RNAs for endogenous TCR genes. The T cells were transferred twice with a 4-week interval in a dose-escalating design. After the second transfer, sequential WT1 peptide vaccines were given. Eight patients, divided into 2 dose cohorts, received cell transfer. No adverse events of normal tissue were seen. The TCR-T cells were detected in peripheral blood for 8 weeks at levels proportional to the dose administered, and in 5 patients, they persisted throughout the study period. The persisting cells maintained ex vivo peptide-specific immune reactivity. Two patients showed transient decreases in blast counts in bone marrow, which was associated with recovery of hematopoiesis. Four of 5 patients who had persistent T cells at the end of the study survived more than 12 months. These results suggest WT1-specific TCR-T cells manipulated by ex vivo culture of polyclonal peripheral lymphocytes survived in vivo and retained the capacity to mount an immune reaction to WT1.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"Late graft failure (LGF) without evidence of residual recipient cells is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and often requires stem cell infusion from the same donor when the patient fails to respond to conventional therapies. We screened the peripheral blood (PB) of 14 patients who developed donor-type LGF at 2 to 132 months after allo-SCT for the presence of the markers for immune-mediated bone marrow (BM) failure. Increased glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored protein-deficient (GPI-AP(-)) leukocytes, which accounted for .009% to 0.147% of the total granulocytes, were detected in 5 patients (severe aplastic anemia, n = 2; follicular lymphoma, n = 1; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 1; myelodysplastic syndromes; n = 1) and 4.7% to 81.2% HLA-allele-lacking leukocytes (HLA-LLs) were detected in 2 patients (acute myelogenous leukemia, n = 1; and myelodysplastic syndromes, n = 1). Three of the 5 patients with increased GPI-AP(-) leukocytes were treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and 2 patients achieved transfusion independence. These results suggest that immune mechanisms that are similar to acquired aplastic anemia underlie condition of approximately one-half of the patients with donor-type LGF, and that in patients with increased GPI-AP(-) cells, donor-derived hematopoiesis may be restored by ATG therapy alone without donor stem cell infusion.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"The Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1 is known to have anti-apoptotic functions, and depletion of Mcl-1 by cellular stresses favors the apoptotic process. Moreover, Mcl-1 levels are frequently increased in various cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is implicated in resistance to conventional chemotherapy and in cancer metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that KRIBB11 accelerates the proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 in the NSCLC cell line, A549. While KRIBB11 is an inhibitor of HSF1, we found that KRIBB11 induced Mcl-1 degradation in an HSF1-independent manner. Furthermore, this process was triggered via increase ubiquitination by the E3 ligase, Mule, rather than via de-ubiquitination by USP9X. Additionally, we found that Mcl-1 levels were only transiently reduced by KRIBB11: Mcl-1 levels were gradually restored as KRIBB11 activity diminished. However, we found that this effect was blocked in BIS (Bcl-2 interacting cell death suppressor, also called BAG3)-depleted cells, and that BIS prevents Mcl-1 from undergoing HSP70-driven proteasomal degradation, through an interaction with HSP70. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting Mcl-1 with KRIBB11 treatment, while simultaneously downregulating BIS, could be a therapeutic strategy in NSCLC.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Marek's disease virus (MDV) and avian leucosis virus (ALV) are known to cause tumours in egg-laying hens. Here, we investigated the aetiology of tumours in a flock of egg-laying hens vaccinated against MDV. We carried out gross pathology and histopathological examinations of the diseased tissues, identified virus antigen and sequenced viral oncogenes to elucidate the cause of death in 21-22-week-old hens. At necropsy, diseased hens had distinctly swollen livers, spleens, and proventriculus, and white tumour nodules in the liver. The spleen and liver had been infiltrated by lymphoid tumour cells, while the proventriculus had been infiltrated by both lymphoid tumour cells and myeloblastic cells. Subtype J ALV (ALV-J) and MDV were widely distributed in the proventricular gland cells, and the lymphoid tumour cells in the liver and the spleen. In addition, positive ALV-J signals were also observed in parts of the reticular cells in the spleen. MDV and ALV-J antigens were observed in the same foci of the proventricular gland cells; however, the two antigens were not observed in the same foci from the spleen and liver. The amino acid sequence of the AN-1 (the representative liver tumour tissue that was positive for both ALV-J and MDV) Meq protein was highly similar to the very virulent MDV QD2014 from China. Compared to the ALV-J HPRS-103 reference strain, 10 amino acids (224-CTTEWNYYAY-233) were deleted from the gp85 protein of AN-1. We concluded that concurrent infection with MDV and ALV-J contributed to the tumorigenicity observed in the flock.",,['NOTNLM'],"[""Marek's disease virus"", 'co-infection', 'subgroup J avian leucosis virus', 'viral oncogenic genes', 'viruses antigen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inotuzumab ozogamicin, a CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, has single-agent activity in R/R ALL. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus low-intensity chemotherapy in patients with R/R ALL. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-arm, phase 2 study of adults with R/R B-cell ALL conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Interventions: The chemotherapy used was lower intensity than hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin [trade name, Adriamycin; Pfizer], and dexamethasone) and is referred to as mini-hyper-CVD (mini-HCVD: cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, and cytarabine at 0.5 g/m2 x 4 doses). Inotuzumab was given on day 3 of the first 4 courses at 1.8 to 1.3 mg/m2 for cycle 1 followed by 1.3 to 1.0 mg/m2 for subsequent cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end points were the overall response rate and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included safety, relapse-free survival (RFS), the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate. Results: Fifty-nine patients (30 women and 29 men) with a median age of 35 years (range, 18-87 years) were treated. Overall, 46 patients (78%) responded, 35 of them (59%) achieving complete response. The overall MRD negativity rate among responders was 82%. Twenty-six patients (44%) received ASCT. Grade 3 to 4 toxic effects included prolonged thrombocytopenia (81%; n = 48), infections (73%; n = 43), and hyperbilirubinemia (14%; n = 8). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in 9 patients (15%). With a median follow-up of 24 months, the median RFS and OS were 8 and 11 months, respectively. The 1-year RFS and OS rates were 40% and 46%, respectively. The 1-year OS rates for patients treated in salvage 1, salvage 2, and salvage 3 or beyond were 57%, 26%, and 39%, respectively (P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: The combination of inotuzumab with low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy shows encouraging results in R/R ALL. The risk of VOD should be considered carefully in patients with previous liver damage and among transplant candidates.

Most recently, chronic inflammation has been described as an important factor for the development and progression of MPNs in the biological continuum from early cancer stage to the advanced myelofibrosis stage, the MPNs being described as ""A Human Inflammation Model for Cancer Development"". This novel concept has been built upon clinical, experimental, genomic, immunological and not least epidemiological studies. Only a few studies have described the development of MPNs by mathematical models, and none have addressed the role of inflammation for clonal evolution and disease progression. Herein, we aim at using mathematical modelling to substantiate the concept of chronic inflammation as an important trigger and driver of MPNs.The basics of the model describe the proliferation from stem cells to mature cells including mutations of healthy stem cells to become malignant stem cells. We include a simple inflammatory coupling coping with cell death and affecting the basic model beneath. First, we describe the system without feedbacks or regulatory interactions. Next, we introduce inflammatory feedback into the system. Finally, we include other feedbacks and regulatory interactions forming the inflammatory-MPN model. Using mathematical modeling, we add further proof to the concept that chronic inflammation may be both a trigger of clonal evolution and an important driving force for MPN disease progression. Our findings support intervention at the earliest stage of cancer development to target the malignant clone and dampen concomitant inflammation.",,,,PMC5578482,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of Influenza A/H1N1 cases diagnosed between January 2015 to December 2015 in the in-patients of Pediatric Oncology unit of a tertiary care hospital from Northern India. RESULTS: In total, 16 children were diagnosed with laboratory confirmed H1N1. Most frequent symptoms were fever and cough. Oseltamivir was administered to all patients. Complications encountered were delay/interruption of antineoplastic therapy (9), need for respiratory support (5), and air leaks (1). Prolonged viral shedding was encountered in 50% of patients who were retested for H1N1 in their throat swabs. There were 2 deaths, 1 in a child of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on induction therapy and another in a child with anaplastic Wilms tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer patients infected with Influenza A/H1N1 are at risk of serious illness and higher mortality. Delay of anticancer treatment is a concern in these infected children. Prompt initiation of antivirals and an optimum duration of treatment are warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The developing immune system may be influenced by allergen, virus, or other exposures from animal sources, which may contribute to childhood cancer incidence. METHODS: Incident cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], central nervous system [CNS], peripheral nervous system [PNS]) for children aged 0-4 diagnosed between 2003 and 2008 were obtained from nine National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries and were linked to U.S. Census of Agriculture data from 2002 and 2007 by county of diagnosis. Animal densities (animal units [AU]/km(2); one animal unit is 1000 pounds of animal weight) were estimated for hogs, cattle, chickens (layers and broilers, separately), equine (horses, ponies, mules, burros, donkeys), goats, sheep, turkeys, and total animals. Animal density was examined in models as both continuous (AU per km(2)) and categorical variables (quartiles). Animal operation densities (per km(2)) by size of operation (cattle, hogs, chickens, sheep) were modeled continuously. Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: We found positive associations between AML and broiler chicken densities (RRper 10AU/km(2) = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02-1.26). ALL rates increased with densities of hog operations (RRper operation/100km(2) = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11). PNS cancer rates were inversely associated with layer chicken density (RRper log of AU/km(2) = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89-0.99). No association was found between any cancer type and densities of cattle, equine, or goats. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by the ecologic study design, some of our findings are novel and should be examined in epidemiological studies with individual level data.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Agricultural exposures', '*Childhood cancer', '*Environmental epidemiology', '*Farm animals', '*Livestock', '*Poultry']",PMC5784771,"['T42 OH008672/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010125-12/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP01012522/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS903272'],,,,,,,

The rapid transcriptional induction is facilitated by the release of poised RNA pol II into productive elongation through assembly of the super elongation complex (SEC). We report that a SEC component, the Eleven -nineteen Lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) family member 3 (ELL3) is dynamically up-regulated in mature and activated human B cells followed by suppression as B cells transition to plasma cells in part mediated by the transcription repressor PRDM1. Burkitt's lymphoma and a sub-set of Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma cell lines abundantly express ELL3. Depletion of ELL3 in the germinal center derived lymphomas results in severe disruption of DNA replication and cell division along with increased DNA damage and cell death.

In particular, ADR was also reported to have reduced drug resistance in multidrug resistant cell lines. However, the mechanism of action (MOA) of ADR's anticancer and anti-drug-resistance activities remain elusive. Methods: In this study, we used the MV4-11 cell line, a FLT3 positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line that displays multidrug resistance, as our experimental system. We first evaluated the effect of ADR on MV4-11 cell proliferation. Then, a quantitative proteomics approach was applied to identify differentially expressed proteins in ADR-treated MV4-11 cells. Finally, cellular processes and signal pathways affected by ADR in MV4-11 cell were predicted with proteomic analysis and validated with in vitro assays. Results: ADR inhibits MV4-11 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. With a proteomic approach, we discovered that ADR inhibited fatty acid synthesis, cellular iron uptake and FLT3 signaling pathway in MV4-11 cells.

RECENT FINDINGS: New prognostic molecular markers were identified in r/r-AML, FLT3-ITD, mutated IDH1, and biallelic CEBPA mutations. Intensive combination chemotherapy including gemtuzumab ozogamicin emerged as an effective salvage therapy in refractory AML. Timing of allo-HCT in r/r-AML may be oriented at the probability to achieve a response to intensive salvage therapy. Several new treatment approaches ranging from new and modified cytotoxic drugs to targeted approaches are in clinical development with first efficacy assessment in single-arm phase II studies. Their external validity may be considerably increased by using a novel design based on a matching approach. SUMMARY: FLT3-ITD, mutated IDH1, and biallelic CEBPA mutations are identified as prognostic molecular markers in r/r-AML. Timing of allo-HCT should be based on the probability to achieve a response to intensive salvage therapy. Several new approaches are currently evaluated and matching for controls may help to increase external validity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 31.,"Busulfan is an alkylating agent used in pre-transplant conditioning for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Several factors contribute to variations in busulfan drug disposition including bioavailability, age, liver function, genetic polymorphisms, and concurrent administration of other drugs. Busulfan is metabolized by hepatic oxidation via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system as well as through conjugation with glutathione. Interactions with drugs such as phenytoin, itraconazole, and metronidazole have been reported to alter busulfan clearance and result in sub- or supra-therapeutic concentrations. We report a case of a clinically significant drug interaction between intravenous busulfan and the bifunctional T-cell engager, blinatumomab, observed through busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring. We found that busulfan clearance was reduced resulting in a higher area under the concentration-time curve when it was administered 48 h after blinatumomab. Repeat busulfan pharmacokinetic testing two weeks later demonstrated increased clearance of the drug and a 31% higher dose recommendation. Similar to other protein therapeutics, cytokine elevations during blinatumomab treatment can lead to cytochrome 3A4 suppression. We hypothesize that the increased busulfan levels observed could be related to a cytokine-mediated CYP3A4 suppression. This represents a unique pharmacologic consideration in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which would impact several drugs that undergo CYP3A4 metabolism, including calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and triazole antifungals. Additionally, this mechanism of CYP3A4 suppression may be relevant in treatments and disease states where cytokine levels are elevated such as haploidentical stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Busulfan', 'blinatumomab', 'cytokines', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim at revealing the possible differences in the cytotoxic effect of free DOX and DOX-BNNP nanoconjugates on these types of cells. The spectrophotometric measurements have demonstrated that the maximum amount of DOX in the DOX-BNNPs is obtained after saturation in alkaline solution (pH 8.4), indicating the high efficiency of BNNPs saturation with DOX. DOX release from DOX-BNNPs is a pH-dependent and DOX is more effectively released in acid medium (pH 4.0-5.0). Confocal laser scanning microscopy has shown that the DOX-BNNPs are internalized by neoplastic cells using endocytic pathway and distributed in cell cytoplasm near the nucleus. The cytotoxic studies have demonstrated a higher sensitivity of the leukemia lines to DOX-BNNPs compared with the carcinoma lines: IC50(DOX-BNNPs) is 1.13, 4.68, 0.025, and 0.14 mug/mL for the KB-3-1, MDR KB-8-5, K562, and MDR i-S9 cell lines, respectively. To uncover the mechanism of cytotoxic effect of nanocarriers on MDR cells, DOX distribution in both the nucleus and cytoplasm has been studied. The results indicate that the DOX-BNNP nanoconjugates significantly change the dynamics of DOX accumulation in the nuclei of both KB-3-1 and KB-8-5 cells. Unlike free DOX, the utilization of DOX-BNNPs nanoconjugates allows for maintaining a high and stable level of DOX in the nucleus of MDR KB-8-5 cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DOX-BNNP nanoconjugates', 'carcinoma and leukemia cell lines', 'cytotoxic effect', 'drug loading', 'multidrug resistant tumor cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite emergence of several prognosticators for better management of patients, there are still limitations for their clinical application due to the complexity of breast tumors, and therefore, new biomarkers for better prognosis of clinical outcomes would be of the great essence. MicroRNAs are highly conserved small non-coding regulatory RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulating of gene expression during different cellular mechanisms. Accumulating studies suggest that miR-218 plays a multifunctional role in various cancer types and different stages. Here, to address prognostic significance of miR-218 in breast cancer, we investigate the expression profile of miR-218 and B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 ( BMI1) gene, as one of the putative targets of miR-218, in 33 paired breast tumors and their adjacent normal tissues with respect to the clinicopathological features of patients using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correlation of both miR-218 and BMI1 gene expression with overall survival of breast cancer patients was also examined recruiting OncoLNC data portal. Finally, to better understand biological function of miR-218 in breast cancer, we performed in silico Gene Ontology and signaling pathway enrichment analysis on miR-218 targetome. According to our data, significant elevation of the expression of miR-218 and downregulation of BMI1 were observed in clinical breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissues ( p < 0.0001). The lower expression of miR-218 was associated with lymph node metastases, higher grades, and poorer prognosis (logrank p = 0.00988), whereas no significant difference in overall survival was observed between patients with higher and lower expression of BMI1 (logrank p = 0.254). These findings suggest that miR-218 expression profiling might be clinically applicable as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. In addition, our in silico enrichment analyses revealed that the association of miR-218 expression with breast cancer prognosis might be through its involvement in endocytosis and gap junction biological pathways.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI1', 'Breast cancer', 'miR-218', 'signaling pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"Among primary brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and most aggressive, with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Thus, it is essential to determine the mechanisms involved in glioma development to develop effective therapies for glioma patients. Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3), a critical member of the PBX family, is frequently overexpressed in multiple human malignancies. However, the expression patterns and biological functions, as well as the involved molecular functions of PBX3 in human gliomas remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that PBX3 expression is increased in both human glioma tissues and cell lines compared with their normal counterparts. These results suggested that PBX3 might be involved in glioma progression. Thus, the role of PBX3 in glioma cell proliferation was investigated using genetic knockdown and overexpression methods. The results showed that PBX3 knockdown inhibited glioma cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, while PBX3 overexpression significantly promoted glioma cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that PBX3 promoted cell proliferation by modulating cell cycle progression. A xenograft LN229 model was used to confirm that PBX3 depletion decreased tumor growth in vivo. In summary, our findings reveal that PBX3 may be a potential therapeutic target in gliomas.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell cycle', 'Gliomas', 'PBX3', 'Proliferation']",,"['81300998 and 81471269/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'BK20131022 and BK20160047/National Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province', 'ky216r201307/Specially-Appointed Professor Foundation of Jiangsu Province', ""XK201117/Jiangsu Province's Key Discipline of Medicine"", 'PAPD/Jiangsu Province and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu', 'Higher Education Institutions']",,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 8.,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a newly characterized, rare malignant tumor of the skin and hematopoietic system. BPDCN occurs mainly in the elderly, whereas it is rarer among children, and has variable clinical manifestations. Optimal chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of BPDCN have not yet been determined and this tumor has a poor prognosis. In this study, two pediatric cases of BPDCN, including a 7-year-old female and a 9-year-old male patient, diagnosed at the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University over the past 2 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Both cases exhibited multiple organ involvement, although the clinical manifestations differed; they were diagnosed with BPDCN based on the clinical manifestations, pathological and immunohistochemical findings, which included positivity for CD4, CD56 and CD123. A high-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy regimen was administered to both patients. The patient in the first case achieved a complete remission, but unfortunately her parents refused follow-up treatment and she succumbed to the disease 9 months after the initial diagnosis. The second patient was treated for a total of three courses with a chemotherapy regimen including daunorubicin, cytarabine and etoposide, followed by two courses of the high-risk ALL chemotherapy regimen; unfortunately, a remission was not achieved and the patient was scheduled to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thus, not all pediatric BPDCN patients may be able to achieve complete remission following chemotherapy with the high-risk ALL regimen, and other treatment options must be investigated in the future.",,['NOTNLM'],"['blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'clinical manifestations', 'immunohistochemistry']",PMC5574061,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 28.,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of patients with cancer. Unfortunately, there has been little progress in the development of supportive therapies for the anti-emetic treatment of patients with hematopoietic tumors. This lack of supportive treatments motivated the present retrospective comparison between two groups of anti-emetic drugs. The current study aimed to compare granisetron and palonosetron in order to determine which is more effective, based on cases of patients undergoing remission induction therapy and consolidation therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Granisetron or palonosetron were administered in Japanese-approved dosages (3 mg granisetron once per day for 5 or 7 days, or one administration of 0.75 mg palonosetron). Patients were randomly selected, and their clinical information was acquired from medical records. The data represent the doctors' and nurses' records. The results demonstrated that palonosetron treatment (in which the drug was administered alone or in combination with aprepitant) was more effective than granisetron treatment for the complete control of acute vomiting. Therefore, in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, palonosetron is an effective regimen to be administered alongside more than 5 continuous days of anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, the combination of palonosetron and aprepitant was found to be the optimal combination. In conclusion, palonosetron is superior to granisetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy for hematological cancers. In Japan, the standard dose of palonosetron is 0.75 mg; a dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron must be compared with 0.75 mg in future studies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting', 'granisetron', 'leukemia', 'palonosetron']",PMC5574161,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"Purpose:RUNX1-mutated (RUNX1(mut)) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with adverse outcome, highlighting the urgent need for a better genetic characterization of this AML subgroup and for the design of efficient therapeutic strategies for this disease. Toward this goal, we further dissected the mutational spectrum and gene expression profile of RUNX1(mut) AML and correlated these results to drug sensitivity to identify novel compounds targeting this AML subgroup.Experimental Design: RNA-sequencing of 47 RUNX1(mut) primary AML specimens was performed and sequencing results were compared to those of RUNX1 wild-type samples. Chemical screens were also conducted using RUNX1(mut) specimens to identify compounds selectively affecting the viability of RUNX1(mut) AML.Results: We show that samples with no remaining RUNX1 wild-type allele are clinically and genetically distinct and display a more homogeneous gene expression profile. Chemical screening revealed that most RUNX1(mut) specimens are sensitive to glucocorticoids (GCs) and we confirmed that GCs inhibit AML cell proliferation through their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We observed that specimens harboring RUNX1 mutations expected to result in low residual RUNX1 activity are most sensitive to GCs, and that coassociating mutations as well as GR levels contribute to GC sensitivity. Accordingly, acquired glucocorticoid sensitivity was achieved by negatively regulating RUNX1 expression in human AML cells.Conclusions: Our findings show the profound impact of RUNX1 allele dosage on gene expression profile and glucocorticoid sensitivity in AML, thereby opening opportunities for preclinical testing which may lead to drug repurposing and improved disease characterization.

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"Purpose: VEGF-targeted therapies have modest efficacy in cancer patients, but acquired resistance is common. The mechanisms underlying such resistance are poorly understood.Experimental Design: To evaluate the potential role of immune cells in the development of resistance to VEGF blockade, we first established a preclinical model of adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to characterize the role of macrophages in such resistance.Results: Using murine cancer models of adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF antibody (AVA), we found a previously unrecognized role of macrophages in such resistance. Macrophages were actively recruited to the tumor microenvironment and were responsible for the emergence of AVA resistance. Depletion of macrophages following emergence of resistance halted tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. In a macrophage-deficient mouse model, resistance to AVA failed to develop, but could be induced by injection of macrophages. Downregulation of macrophage VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 expression accompanied upregulation of alternative angiogenic pathways, facilitating escape from anti-VEGF therapy.Conclusions: These findings provide a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the modest efficacy of current antiangiogenesis therapies and identify new opportunities for combination approaches for ovarian and other cancers.

Despite the high prevalence of H3(K27M) mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and their well-established impact on global histone H3 lysine 27 di- and trimethylation (H3K27me2/3), the relevance of these mutations has not been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we report the first identification of H3(K27M) and H3(K27I) mutations in patients with AML. We find that these lesions are major determinants of reduced H3K27me2/3 in these patients and that they are associated with common aberrations in the RUNX1 gene. We demonstrate that H3(K27I/M) mutations are strong disease accelerators in a RUNX1-RUNX1T1 AML mouse model, suggesting that H3K27me2/3 has an important and selective leukemia-suppressive activity in this genetic context.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2017 Nov 16;130(20):2156-2157.

To detect the alteration of gut bacteria in children with ALL and analyse the impact of short-term-use of antibiotics on the changes caused by ALL.Methodology. We collected faecal samples from both children with ALL and healthy children. According to their medication history with antibiotics, we classified the samples into ALL+ATBx, ALL, CON+ATBx and CON groups. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify the gut bacteria according to the MiSeq platform. The Shannon index, Simpson index, Chao index and Ace index were used to represent the alpha diversity of gut bacteria. The beta diversity was estimated using the principles of co-ordinate analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. The taxon composition and presence of biomarkers were then determined through bioinformatics.Results. With regard to alpha diversity, the Shannon index and Simpson index differed significantly between the ALL and CON groups, as well as the CON+ATBx and CON groups, but not the ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx groups. With regard to beta diversity, the ALL and CON separated clearly into clusters, as did ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx. There were differences in composition among the four groups at different taxonomy hierarchies. More bacteria showed an obvious difference between the paired groups ALL and CON than did for the paired groups ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for Bacteroidales and Enterococcaceae used to predict ALL were 0.735 and 0.724, respectively.Conclusion. ALL induced structural changes of the gut microbiota, with the alpha diversity being significantly weakened by antibiotics, but not beta diversity.

However, the potential for such therapies in targeting these epitopes remains uncertain due to a lack of knowledge of the neoepitope landscape in childhood cancer. Studies to date have focused primarily on missense mutations without exploring gene fusions, which are a major class of oncogenic drivers in pediatric cancer. METHODS: We developed an analytical workflow for identification of putative neoepitopes based on somatic missense mutations and gene fusions using whole-genome sequencing data. Transcriptome sequencing data were incorporated to interrogate the expression status of the neoepitopes. RESULTS: We present the neoepitope landscape of somatic alterations including missense mutations and oncogenic gene fusions identified in 540 childhood cancer genomes and transcriptomes representing 23 cancer subtypes. We found that 88% of leukemias, 78% of central nervous system tumors, and 90% of solid tumors had at least one predicted neoepitope. Mutation hotspots in KRAS and histone H3 genes encode potential epitopes in multiple patients. Additionally, the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion was found to encode putative neoepitopes in a high proportion (69.6%) of the pediatric leukemia harboring this fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a comprehensive repertoire of potential neoepitopes in childhood cancers, and will facilitate the development of immunotherapeutic approaches designed to exploit them.

10.1186/s12967-017-1286-5.,"BACKGROUND: As one of the major treatment obstacles in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+)ALL), relapse of Ph(+)ALL may result from the persistence of leukemia-propagating cells (LPCs). Research using a xenograft mouse assay recently determined that LPCs were enriched in the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD58(-) fraction in human Ph(+)ALL. Additionally, a cohort study demonstrated that Ph(+)ALL patients with a LPCs phenotype at diagnosis exhibited a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse than those with the other cell phenotypes even with uniform front-line imatinib-based therapy pre- and post-allotransplant, thus highlighting the need for novel LPCs-based therapeutic strategies. METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to analyze the gene expression profiles of the sorted LPCs and other cell fractions from patients with de novo Ph(+)ALL. In order to assess the effects of the selective BCR-ABL and/or Janus kinase (JAK)2 inhibition therapy by the treatment with single agents or a combination of ruxolitinib and imatinib or nilotinib on Ph(+)ALL LPCs, drug-induced apoptosis of LPCs was investigated in vitro, as well as in vivo using sublethally irradiated and anti-CD122-conditioned NOD/SCID xenograft mouse assay. Moreover, western blot analyses were performed on the bone marrow cells harvested from the different groups of recipient mice. RESULTS: RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR demonstrated that JAK2 was more highly expressed in the sorted LPCs than in the other cell fractions in de novo Ph(+)ALL patients.

Systems-level analyses offer increased power to sort patients on the basis of coordinated changes across immune cells and proteins. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a well-established form of immunotherapy whereby a donor immune system induces a graft-versus-leukemia response. This fails when the donor immune system regenerates improperly, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and leukemia relapse. We present a systems-level analysis by mass cytometry and serum profiling in 26 patients sampled 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Using a combination of machine learning and topological data analyses, we show that global immune signatures associated with clinical outcome can be revealed, even when patients are few and heterogeneous.

Thus, immune reconstitution with CD8+ T-cells is critical for the outcome of patients after allogeneic SCT. Certain miRNAs such as miR-146a or miR-155 play an important role in the regulation of post-transplant immunity in mice. While some miRNAs e.g. miR-423 or miR-155 are regulated in plasma or full blood during acute GvHD also in man, the relevance and expression profile of miRNAs in T-cells after allogeneic SCT is unknown. miR-625-3p has recently been described to be overexpressed in colorectal malignancies where it promotes migration, invasion and apoptosis resistance. Since similar regulative functions in cancer and T-cells have been described for an increasing number of miRNAs, we assumed a role for the cancer-related miR-625-3p also in T-cells. Here, we studied miR-625-3p expression selectively in CD8+ T-cells both in vitro and during immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT in man. T-cell receptor stimulation lead to miR-625-3p upregulation in human CD8+ T-cells in vitro. Maintenance of elevated miR-625-3p expression levels was dependent on ongoing T-cell proliferation and was abrogated by withdrawal of interleukin 2 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Finally, miR-625-3p expression was analyzed in human CD8+ T-cells purified from 137 peripheral blood samples longitudinally collected from 74 patients after allogeneic SCT. miR-625-3p expression was upregulated on day 25 and on day 45, i.e. during the early phase of CD8+ T-cell reconstitution after allogeneic SCT and subsequently declined with completion of CD8+ T-cell reconstitution until day 150. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that miR-625-3p is regulated in CD8+ T-cells during proliferation in vitro and during early immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT in vivo. These results warrant further studies to identify the targets and function of miR-625-3p in CD8+ T-cells and to analyze its predictive value for an effective immune reconstitution.",,,,PMC5576678,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood and there are few therapeutic options. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss, and chronic glial activation. Whether microglial activation, which is generally viewed as a secondary process, is harmful or protective in neurodegeneration remains unclear. Late-onset neurodegenerative disease observed in patients with histiocytoses, which are clonal myeloid diseases associated with somatic mutations in the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway such as BRAF(V600E), suggests a possible role of somatic mutations in myeloid cells in neurodegeneration. Yet the expression of BRAF(V600E) in the haematopoietic stem cell lineage causes leukaemic and tumoural diseases but not neurodegenerative disease. Microglia belong to a lineage of adult tissue-resident myeloid cells that develop during organogenesis from yolk-sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) distinct from haematopoietic stem cells. We therefore hypothesized that a somatic BRAF(V600E) mutation in the EMP lineage may cause neurodegeneration. Here we show that mosaic expression of BRAF(V600E) in mouse EMPs results in clonal expansion of tissue-resident macrophages and a severe late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. This is associated with accumulation of ERK-activated amoeboid microglia in mice, and is also observed in human patients with histiocytoses. In the mouse model, neurobehavioural signs, astrogliosis, deposition of amyloid precursor protein, synaptic loss and neuronal death were driven by ERK-activated microglia and were preventable by BRAF inhibition. These results identify the fetal precursors of tissue-resident macrophages as a potential cell-of-origin for histiocytoses and demonstrate that a somatic mutation in the EMP lineage in mice can drive late-onset neurodegeneration. Moreover, these data identify activation of the MAP kinase pathway in microglia as a cause of neurodegeneration and this offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention aimed at the prevention of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.",,,,PMC6047345,"['R01 CA201247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI130345/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201247-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL138090/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS895894'],,"['Nature. 2017 Sep 21;549(7672):340-342.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"Purpose: Many adult survivors of childhood cancer are at high-risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Cancer therapy may cause damage to the vascular endothelium, thereby initiating atherosclerosis. Atorvastatin has been shown to improve endothelial function independent of reducing cholesterol, as well as reduce/slow arterial stiffness and thickening, yet has never been studied in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Methods: Twenty-seven young adult (age 26.8 +/- 6.2 years) survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomly assigned (1:1) 40 mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo for 6 months. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), small artery reactive hyperemia index (RHI), arterial stiffness, and carotid artery elasticity/thickness were assessed. Results: Fifteen participants completed the trial. No significant treatment effect for any vascular outcomes was observed at 6 months; however, a significant decrease in peak FMD (-3.0 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.3, -0.7]) and a trending significant decrease in RHI (-0.3 [95% CI: -0.62, 0.01]) was observed in the placebo group, resulting in a trend toward a treatment effects (p < 0.10). No effect on arterial stiffness, carotid arterial elasticity, or thickness was observed. Conclusion: Six months of atorvastatin treatment did not improve endothelial function or arterial stiffness in young adult CCS. While a trend toward an improvement in endothelial function was present, findings should be interpreted with caution owing to the small number of evaluable participants and subsequent lack of sufficient power. Further research in a larger sample size is needed to fully elucidate the effects of atorvastatin on vascular function.

Human NSPCs are selectively expanded as free-floating neurospheres in serum-free culture medium containing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF); however, the culture conditions still need to be optimized for performance and cost before the method is used clinically. Here, to improve the NSPC culture method for clinical use, we used an ATP assay to screen the effects of various reagents on human NSPC proliferation. Human NSPCs responded to EGF, FGF2, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a dose-dependent manner, and the minimum concentrations eliciting maximum effects were 10 ng/ml EGF, 10 ng/ml FGF2, and 5 ng/ml LIF. EGF and LIF were stable in culture medium without NSPCs, although FGF2 was degraded. In the presence of human NSPCs, however, FGF2 and LIF were both degraded very rapidly, to below the estimated minimum concentration on day 3, but EGF remained above the minimum concentration for 5 days. Adding supplemental doses of each growth factor during the incubation promoted human NSPC proliferation. Among other supplements, insulin and transferrin promoted human NSPC growth, but progesterone, putrescine, selenite, D-glucose, and lactate were not effective and were cytotoxic at higher concentrations. Supplementing with conditioned medium from human NSPCs significantly increased human NSPC proliferation, but using a high percentage of the medium had a negative effect. These findings suggest that human NSPC culture is regulated by a balance in the culture medium between decreasing growth factor levels and increasing positive or negative factors derived from the NSPCs. Thus, in designing culture conditions for human NSPCs, it is useful to take the individual properties of each factor into consideration.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP assay', 'Culture condition', 'Human neural stem/progenitor cell', 'Neuropshere']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germline variants in the POT1 gene have recently been shown to be associated with risk of developing tumors in different tissues such as familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal, glioma and melanoma tumors. Recently, we uncovered a variant in the POT1 gene (p.R117C) as causative of familial cardiac angiosarcomas (CAS) in Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome families. Our in silico studies predicted that this protein had lost the ability to interact with TPP1 and single-stranded DNA. In vitro studies corroborated this prediction and showed that this lack of function leads to abnormally long telomeres. To better understand the POT1 gene and its role with tumorigenesis, we extended the study to LFL (with and without members affected with angiosarcomas (AS)) and sporadic AS and cardiac sarcomas. We found POT1 variants in the 20% of the families with members affected with AS and 10% of sporadic AS and sarcomas. In silico studies predicted that these new variants were damaging in the same manner as previously described for the POT1 p.R117C variants. The wide spectrum of variants in the POT1 gene leading to tumorigenesis in different tissues demonstrates its general importance. Study of the POT1 gene should be considered as routine diagnostic in these cancers.",,,,PMC5643968,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical significance of miR-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its specific role in tumor endothelium. METHODS: miR-1 levels were measured by Taqman assay. Endothelial cells were isolated by magnetic sorting. We used vascular endothelial cadherin promoter to create a vascular-specific miR-1 lentiviral vector and an inducible transgenic mouse. KRAS(G12D mut)/Trp(53-/-) (KP) mice, lung-specific vascular endothelial growth factor transgenic mice, Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts, and primary endothelial cells were used to test the effects of miR-1. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In two cohorts of patients with NSCLC, miR-1 levels were lower in tumors than the cancer-free tissue. Tumor miR-1 levels correlated with the overall survival of patients with NSCLC. miR-1 levels were also lower in endothelial cells isolated from NSCLC tumors and tumor-bearing lungs of KP mouse model. We examined the significance of lower miR-1 levels by testing the effects of vascular-specific miR-1 overexpression. Vector-mediated delivery or transgenic overexpression of miR-1 in endothelial cells decreased tumor burden in KP mice, reduced the growth and vascularity of Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts, and decreased tracheal angiogenesis in vascular endothelial growth factor transgenic mice. In endothelial cells, miR-1 level was regulated through phosphoinositide 3-kinase and specifically controlled proliferation, de novo DNA synthesis, and ERK1/2 activation. Myeloproliferative leukemia oncogene was targeted by miR-1 in the lung endothelium and regulated tumor growth and angiogenesis.

Therefore data regarding treatment of CMML is largely derived from MDS trials. Two published studies suggest efficacy of lenalidomide in a proportion of patients with CMML, but the number of patients included was very low. We initiated this phase I trial with lenalidomide in patients with CMML. Primary objective of the current study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives were safety, tolerability and response. Twenty patients were enrolled and received lenalidomide using a classical 3 + 3 design. Lenalidomide 5 mg daily was confirmed as MTD. Best response achieved was partial remission in one patient and stable disease in nine patients. Lack of response with primary progressive disease was seen in three patients. Lenalidomide had a good toxicity profile in this study with thrombocytopenia being the main toxicity observed.

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the frequencies and the association with genetic/cytogenetic abnormalities as well as prognostic relevance of RAS pathway mutations in Taiwanese children with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the largest cohort in Asians. PROCEDURE: Between 1995 and 2012, marrow samples at diagnosis from 535 children were studied for NRAS, KRAS, and PTPN11 mutations. The mutational status of each gene was correlated with the clinico-hematological features, recurrent genetic abnormalities, and outcomes for those treated with TPOG-ALL-2002 protocol (n = 346). RESULTS: The frequencies of NRAS, KRAS, and PTPN11 mutations were 10.8% (57/530), 10.2% (54/530), and 3.0% (16/526), respectively. NRAS mutations were associated with a higher frequency of hyperdiploidy (P = 0.01) and lower frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 (P < 0.01), whereas KRAS mutations were associated with younger age (P < 0.01), a higher frequency of KMT2A rearranged (P < 0.01) but no significant difference if infants with ALL were excluded, and inferior event-free survival (66.6% vs. 80.5%, P = 0.04). None of patients with TCF3-PBX1 had KRAS mutation (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the frequency of KRAS mutations in Taiwan was significantly higher than that reported in Caucasians. The occurrence of RAS pathway mutations was associated with recurrent genetic/cytogenetic abnormalities in pediatric B-precursor ALL.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['KRAS', 'NRAS', 'PTPN11 mutation', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring for minimal residual disease by measuring BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA is a key component of CML management. CP-CML patients who achieve a stable deep molecular response may discontinue (TKIs) with an ~ 50% chance of entering treatment-free remission (TFR). So far discontinuation of TKIs has largely been limited to clinical trials, but is on the verge of becoming a part of wider clinical practice. Careful patient selection, dense molecular monitoring, and prompt reinstitution of treatment in the event of relapse are all vital to reproduce the same level of success. Much effort has been dedicated to identifying therapeutic strategies to eliminate CML stem cells and enable to TFR in more patients.

However, the signal transduction pathways downstream of JAK3 mutations remain poorly characterized. Here we describe the phosphoproteome downstream of the JAK3(L857Q)/(M511I) activating mutations in transformed Ba/F3 lymphocyte cells. Signaling pathways regulated by JAK3 mutants were assessed following acute inhibition of JAK1/JAK3 using the JAK kinase inhibitors ruxolitinib or tofacitinib. Comprehensive network interrogation using the phosphoproteomic signatures identified significant changes in pathways regulating cell cycle, translation initiation, mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, RNA metabolism, as well as epigenetic and apoptotic processes. Key regulatory proteins within pathways that showed altered phosphorylation following JAK inhibition were targeted using selumetinib and trametinib (MEK), buparlisib (PI3K) and ABT-199 (BCL2), and found to be synergistic in combination with JAK kinase inhibitors in primary T-ALL samples harboring JAK3 mutations. These data provide the first detailed molecular characterization of the downstream signaling pathways regulated by JAK3 mutations and provide further understanding into the oncogenic processes regulated by constitutive kinase activation aiding in the development of improved combinatorial treatment regimens.",,,,PMC5843905,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2731.

EVs were characterized by flow cytometry using a panel of 13 antibodies against specific membrane proteins that were reported to be predictive of acute GVHD. We observed a correlation between three potential biomarkers expressed on EV surface and acute GVHD onset by both logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. In our study, CD146 (MCAM-1) was correlated with an increased risk-by almost 60%-of developing GVHD, whereas CD31 and CD140-alpha (PECAM-1 and PDGFR-alpha) with a decreased risk-by almost 40 and 60%, respectively. These biomarkers also showed a significant change in signal level from baseline to the onset of acute GVHD.

PML-NBs are assembled by PML isoforms, and contact between small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) with the SUMO interaction motif (SIM) are critically involved in this process. PML isoforms contain a common N-terminal region and a variable C-terminus. However, the contribution of the C-terminal regions to PML-NB formation remains poorly defined. Here, using high-resolution microscopy, we show that mutation of the SIM distinctively influences the structure of NBs formed by each individual PML isoform, with that of PML-III and PML-V minimally changed, and PML-I and PML-IV dramatically impaired. We further identify several C-terminal elements that are important in regulating NB structure and provide strong evidence to suggest that the 8b element in PML-IV possesses a strong ability to interact with SUMO-1 and SUMO-2, and critically participates in NB formation.

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication associated with the treatment of some cancers. If left untreated, TLS may result in acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, neurologic complications, seizures, or death. Tumor lysis syndrome is most commonly observed in patients with hematologic malignancies with a high proliferation rate undergoing treatment with very effective therapies. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), historically, TLS has been observed less often, owing to a low proliferation rate and slow response to chemotherapy. New targeted therapies have recently been approved in the treatment of CLL, including the oral kinase inhibitors, idelalisib and ibrutinib, and the B-cell lymphoma-2 protein inhibitor, venetoclax. Several others are also under development, and combination strategies of these agents are being explored. This review examines the diagnosis, prevention, and management of TLS and summarizes the TLS experience in CLL clinical trials with newer targeted agents. Overall, the risk of TLS is small, but the consequences may be fatal; therefore, patients should be monitored carefully. Therapies capable of eliciting rapid response and combination regimens are increasingly being evaluated for treatment of CLL, which may pose a higher risk of TLS. For optimal management, patients at risk for TLS require prophylaxis and close monitoring with appropriate tests and appropriate management to correct laboratory abnormalities, which allows for safe and effective disease control. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal condition observed with hematologic malignancies, caused by release of cellular components in the bloodstream from rapidly dying tumor cells. The frequency and severity of TLS is partly dependent upon the biology of the disease and type of therapy administered. Novel targeted agents highly effective at inducing rapid cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may pose a risk for TLS in patients with tumors characterized by rapid growth, high tumor burden, and/or high sensitivity to treatment. In this review, prevention strategies and management of patients with CLL who develop TLS are described.","['(c) 2017 The Authors The Oncologist published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on', 'behalf of AlphaMed Press.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Hematologic malignancies', '*Targeted cancer agents', '*Tumor lysis syndrome']",PMC5679833,,"['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 26.,"The levels of cAMP are regulated by phosphodiesterase enzymes (PDEs), which are targets for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. We have previously shown that PDE8 regulates T cell motility. Here, for the first time, we report that PDE8A exerts part of its control of T cell function through the V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) kinase signaling pathway. To examine T cell motility under physiologic conditions, we analyzed T cell interactions with endothelial cells and ligands in flow assays. The highly PDE8-selective enzymatic inhibitor PF-04957325 suppresses adhesion of in vivo myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) activated inflammatory CD4(+) T effector (Teff) cells to brain endothelial cells under shear stress. Recently, PDE8A was shown to associate with Raf-1 creating a compartment of low cAMP levels around Raf-1 thereby protecting it from protein kinase A (PKA) mediated inhibitory phosphorylation. To test the function of this complex in Teff cells, we used a cell permeable peptide that selectively disrupts the PDE8A-Raf-1 interaction. The disruptor peptide inhibits the Teff-endothelial cell interaction more potently than the enzymatic inhibitor. Furthermore, the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction was identified as a target of disruptor peptide mediated reduction of adhesion, spreading and locomotion of Teff cells under flow. Mechanistically, we observed that disruption of the PDE8A-Raf-1 complex profoundly alters Raf-1 signaling in Teff cells. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that PDE8A inhibition by enzymatic inhibitors or PDE8A-Raf-1 kinase complex disruptors decreases Teff cell adhesion and migration under flow, and represents a novel approach to target T cells in inflammation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The main purpose of this study were to investigate that the correlation between PIM-1 mRNA levels and clinicopathologic features and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed for 118 de novo AML and 20 AML complete remission patients and 15 normal individuals. All statistical analysis were performed using Graphpad Prism5 software. RESULTS: We observed that expression of PIM-1 mRNA was higher in AML patients than in healthy individuals and in complete remission AML patients (P = 0.0177). Further, high PIM-1 mRNA levels were more associated with high-risk FLT3+ AML patients than the FLT3- group (P = 0.0001) and were also associated with clinical factors such as risk stratification (P = 0.0029) and vital status (P = 0.0322). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that PIM-1 mRNA expression correlated with overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), and relapse rate (RR) in AML patients. Most importantly, the high PIM-1-expressing patients took longer to achieve complete remission than the low expression group (P = 0.001). In addition, the complete remission rate was significantly lower in the high PIM-1 group (P = 0.0277) after induction therapy.

Somatic mutations result in dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways, epigenetics, and apoptosis of the leukemia cells. Understanding the basis for the dysregulated processes provides the platform for the design of novel targeted therapy for AML patients. The effort to devise new targeted therapy has been helped by recent advances in methods for high-throughput genomic screening and the availability of computer-assisted techniques for the design of novel agents that are predicted to specifically inhibit the mutant molecules involved in these intracellular events. In this review, we will provide the scientific basis for targeting the dysregulated molecular mechanisms and discuss the agents currently being investigated, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, for treating patients with AML.

We have previously demonstrated that EphA2 stimulation by ephrin-A1 promotes cell adhesion through interaction with integrins and integrin ligands in two monocyte/macrophage cell lines. Although mature mononuclear leukocytes express several members of the EphA/ephrin-A subclass, their expression has not been examined in monocytes undergoing during differentiation and maturation. RESULTS: Using RT-PCR, we have shown that EphA2, ephrin-A1, and ephrin-A2 expression was upregulated in murine bone marrow mononuclear cells during monocyte maturation. Moreover, EphA2 and EphA4 expression was induced, and ephrin-A4 expression was upregulated, in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, along with monocyte differentiation toward the classical CD14(++)CD16(-) monocyte subset. Using RT-PCR and flow cytometry, we have also shown that expression levels of alphaL, alphaM, alphaX, and beta2 integrin subunits were upregulated in HL60 cells along with monocyte differentiation while those of alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, and beta1 subunits were unchanged. Using a cell attachment stripe assay, we have shown that stimulation by EphA as well as ephrin-A, likely promoted adhesion to an integrin ligand-coated surface in HL60 monocytes. Moreover, EphA and ephrin-A stimulation likely promoted the formation of protrusions in HL60 monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Notably, this study is the first analysis of EphA/ephrin-A expression during monocytic differentiation/maturation and of ephrin-A stimulation affecting monocyte adhesion to an integrin ligand-coated surface. Thus, we propose that monocyte adhesion via integrin activation and the formation of protrusions is likely promoted by stimulation of EphA as well as of ephrin-A.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell adhesion', '*Differentiation', '*EphA', '*Ephrin-A', '*HL60', '*Monocytes']",PMC5576293,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the authors study whether a poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA) coating can suppress attachment and biofilm formation by Candida albicans and whether caspofungin terminally attached to surface-tethered polymeric linkers can provide additional benefits. The multistep coating scheme first involved the plasma polymerization of ethanol, followed by the attachment of alpha-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBB) onto surface hydroxyl groups of the plasma polymer layer. Polymer chains were grafted using surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization with 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, yielding PHEMA layers with a dry thickness of up to 89 nm in 2 h. Hydroxyl groups of PHEMA were oxidized to aldehydes using the Albright-Goldman reaction, and caspofungin was covalently immobilized onto them using reductive amination. While the PHEMA layer by itself reduced the growth of C. albicans biofilms by log 1.4, the addition of caspofungin resulted in a marked further reduction by >4 log units to below the threshold of the test. The authors have confirmed that the predominant mechanism of action is caused by antifungal drug molecules that are covalently attached to the surface, rather than out-diffusing from the coating. The authors confirm the selectivity of surface-attached caspofungin in eliminating fungal, not mammalian cells by showing no measurable toxicity toward the myeloid leukaemia suspension cell line KG-1a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the clinical presentation and associated outcomes of influenza at two comprehensive cancer centers (center 1 in the United States and center 2 in Mexico). Clinical and laboratory data on patients with HMs and influenza infection diagnosed from April 2009 to May 2014 at the two centers were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 190 patients were included, the majority were male (63%) with a median age of 49 years (range, 1-88 years), and had active or refractory HMs (76%). Compared to center 1, patients in center 2 were significantly sicker (active cancer, decreased albumin levels, elevated creatinine levels, or hypoxia at influenza diagnosis) and experienced higher lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) rate (42% vs 7%; P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval), leukemia, (3.09, 1.23-7.70), decreased albumin level (3.78, 1.55-9.20), hypoxia at diagnosis (14.98, 3.30-67.90), respiratory co-infection (5.87, 1.65-20.86), and corticosteroid use (2.71, 1.03-7.15) were significantly associated with LRI; and elevated creatinine level (3.33, 1.05-10.56), hypoxia at diagnosis (5.87, 1.12-30.77), and respiratory co-infection (6.30, 1.55-25.67) were significantly associated with 60 day mortality in both centers.

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Newer treatment modalities are being investigated to improve upon historical outcomes with standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in aplastic anemia (AA). We analyzed outcomes of adult patients with AA treated with various combinatorial anti-thymoglobulin-based IST regimens in frontline and relapsed/refractory (R/R) settings. Pretreatment and on-treatment clinical characteristics were analyzed for relationships to response and outcome. Among 126 patients reviewed, 95 were treatment-naive (TN) and 63, R/R (including 32 from the TN cohort); median ages were 49 and 50 years, respectively. Overall survival (OS) was superior in IST responders (P < .001). Partial response to IST was associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS), as compared with complete response (P = .03). By multivariate analysis, baseline platelet and lymphocyte count predicted for IST response at 3 and 6 months, respectively. While additional growth factor interventions led to faster count recovery, there were no statistically significant differences in RFS or OS across the various frontline IST regimens (i.e., with/without G-CSF or eltrombopag). While marrow cellularity did not correlate with peripheral-blood counts at 3 months, cytomorphological assessment revealed dyspoietic changes in all nonresponders with hypercellular-marrow indices. Covert dysplasia, identified through early bone marrow assessment, has implications on future therapy choices after IST failure. Salvage IST response depended upon prior response to ATG: prior responders (46%) vs. primary refractory (0%) (P < .01). In the R/R setting, there was no survival difference between IST and allogeneic stem cell transplant groups, with a trend toward superior OS in the former. Transplant benefits in the R/R setting may be underrealized due to transplant-related mortality.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,PMC5987765,"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS949280'],,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"Glucocorticoid (GC) shows antileukaemic activity via binding to the GC receptor (GR). The human GR gene has 4 splicing variants besides the functional isoform GRalpha, but their significance in GC sensitivity of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has been inconsistent. Additionally, several studies evaluated the relevance of GR gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GC sensitivity of ALL, but the current cumulative evidence appears inconclusive. Addressing limitations in previous studies, we used a large series of B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cell lines established from Japanese patients to comprehensively examine all 5 splicing variants of the GR gene and candidate SNPs, and their association with GC-sensitivity. We performed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses with 10 sets of primers that differentially quantify the 5 isoforms in different combinations, and the strongest correlations with GC sensitivity were observed for the real-time RT-PCR of exons 7 and 8 (prednisolone sensitivity; r = -0.534, R(2) = 0.29, P = 1.4 x 10(-6) ) and exons 8 and 9a (r = -0.583, R(2) = 0.34, P = 7.6 x 10(-8) ), both specific for GRalpha and GRgamma isoforms. In contrast, the real-time RT-PCR of junction of exons 3g and 4 and exon 4, specific for GRgamma isoform alone, did not show significant correlation with GC sensitivity (prednisolone sensitivity; r = -0.403, R(2) = 0.16, P = 4.6 x 10(-4) ). These observations are consistent with the notion that GRalpha plays a central role in the GC-mediated proapoptotic activity in BCP-ALL. In addition, a promoter region SNP genotype (rs72555796) showed a significant association with GC sensitivity (prednisolone sensitivity; P = .010) and tended to show an association with GR gene expression (RT-PCR of exons 7 and 8; P = .170). These findings indicate that isoform profiles and SNP genotypes of the GR gene may be useful indicators of GC sensitivity in BCP-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 25.,"Chemotherapy drug (paclitaxel, PTX) incorporated in a dual functional polymeric nanocarrier, PEG-Fmoc-NLG, has shown promise as an immunochemotherapy in a murine breast cancer model, 4T1.2. The formulation is composed of an amphiphilic polymer with a built-in immunotherapy drug NLG919 that exhibits the immunostimulatory ability through the inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) in cancer cells. This work evaluates whether the PEG-derivatized NLG polymer can also be used for delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) in treatment of leukemia. The Dox-loaded micelles were self-assembled from PEG-Fmoc-NLG conjugate, which have a spherical shape with a uniform size of approximately 120 nm. In cultured murine lymphocytic leukemia cells (A20), Dox-loaded PEG-Fmoc-NLG micelles showed a cytotoxicity that was comparable to that of free Dox. For in vivo studies, significantly improved antitumor activity was observed for the Dox/PEG-Fmoc-NLG group compared to Doxil or the free Dox group in an A20 lymphoma mouse model. Flow cytometric analysis showed that treatment with Dox/PEG-Fmoc-NLG micelles led to significant increases in the numbers of both total CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells and the functional CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells with concomitant decreases in the numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Dox/PEG-Fmoc-NLG may represent a promising immunochemotherapy for lymphoma, which warrants more studies in the future.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*doxorubicin', '*dual-functional nanocarrier', '*immunochemotherapy', '*lymphoma']",,['R21 CA173887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of donor NK cells' anti-tumor activity in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) was the trigger to conduct many clinical trials infusing NK cells. Surprisingly, many of these studies did not obtain optimal results, suggesting that many different NK cell parameters combined with the best clinical protocol need to be optimized. Various parameters including the high array of activating receptors that NK cells have, the source of NK cells selected to treat patients, different cytotoxic mechanisms that NK cells activate depending on the target cell and tumor cell survival mechanisms need to be considered before choosing the best immunotherapeutic strategy using NK cells. In this review, we will discuss these parameters to help improve current strategies using NK cells in cancer therapy. Moreover, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modification, which has revolutionized the concept of immunotherapy, will be discussed in the context of NK cells.
