In 95 staged malignant melanoma patients and 71 individuals with leukemia and lymphoma, this heterogeneity was analyzed biochemically in sera positive for CIC. CICs were measured by a multiassay system and individual complexes were isolated and analyzed by immunological and biochemical methods. Analyses of sera from 100 normal individuals, from 25 rheumatoid women, and a group of 12 laboratory staff who work with human melanoma were included for comparison. Three basic patterns of complexes were identified circulating in the sera of the cancer patients. Type I are medium-sized (17-23S), complement-fixing complexes usually occurring in combinations. The prototype in melanoma contained IgG antibody and additional glycoprotein components and bound complement by the classical pathway. In hematological malignancies four subtypes could be identified depending on whether the antibody class was IgG or IgM, the nonimmunoglobulin component was glycoprotein or protein, and whether complement fixation occurred by the classical or alternate pathway. Type II complexes were noncomplement-fixing, medium-sized complexes (15-21S), which in melanoma contained IgG antibody and additional protein components. In the hematologic malignancies two subtypes could be identified depending on whether the antibody class was IgG or IgM. Both subtypes contained a glycoprotein nonimmunoglobulin component. Both melanoma and hematologic tumors had type III heavy complexes (36-44S) which were noncomplement-fixing and contained only immunoglobulin components, either IgG-IgG or IgM-IgG. As expected the rheumatoid arthritis patients frequently had both 7S and 21-23S CICs containing IgG as well as IgM rheumatoid factor with complement fixation via the classical pathway. No CICs were detected in normal young men and women (20-30 years); a few individuals in middle age (31-50 years) had small (7-11S) CICs which bound complement by the classical pathway and contained IgG and a protein nonimmunoglobulin component. The frequency of these 7S complexes increased with advancing age, with the appearance of 23S IgG-IgG or IgM-IgG complexes. IgG antibodies from only the melanoma patients reacted with cytoplasmic components of fresh melanoma cells, except the laboratory workers where all of their isolated CIC antibodies also reacted with melanoma cells. Thus the heterogeneity of complexes in melanoma is not random, but can be classified into three basic biochemical patterns. The hematologic group provides a slightly richer variation of subtypes within this basic scheme.","['Queen, W D', 'Bharwani, N', 'Phillips, E A', 'Ruether, B A', 'Phillips, T M', 'Jerry, L M']","['Queen WD', 'Bharwani N', 'Phillips EA', 'Ruether BA', 'Phillips TM', 'Jerry LM']","['Immunochemistry Laboratory, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000226674 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1989;46(1):14-25. doi: 10.1159/000226674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a combination of both agents was studied. When the leukemic target cells were submitted to killer cells activated with 100 or 800 IU of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), only averages of 6.0 and 16.7% of the targets were killed respectively. When the remaining, refractory cells were confronted with a cocktail of individually phenotyped monoclonal antibodies and complement, an additional significant cell kill was obtained, but it amounted to only between 7.4 and 5.5% (for LAK-100 and LAK-800, respectively). In contrast, of the target cells initially refractory to the same cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, all were cross-resistant both to LAK-cells activated with 100 and to those activated with 800 IU of rIL-2. This cross-resistance was caused neither by sub-optimal LAK-cell activation, nor by antibody blocking of hypothetical LAK-cell receptors, since pre-incubation with monoclonal antibodies without complement did not inhibit LAK-cell cytotoxicity. Although only partial cross-resistance was found in the present study, it still remains that only a minority of the tumor cells could be killed. A higher in-vitro cell kill should be attempted prior to clinical trials in order to avoid clinical effects resembling those of a partial surgical tumor resection.","['Vasilopoulos, G', 'Sjogren, A M', 'Reizenstein, P']","['Vasilopoulos G', 'Sjogren AM', 'Reizenstein P']","['Hematology Laboratory, Karolinska Hospital and Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90036-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(1):87-91. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90036-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter grow permanently in vitro. Hyperplastic spleens obtained from mice recovering from anemia were analysed as controls. In addition to the detection of mRNAs, Southern blotting was carried out to observe whether rearrangement or amplification of oncogenes had occurred. The results show that the nuclear oncogenes c-myc, c-myb and p53 are strongly expressed in leukemic tissue, whereas c-fos transcripts show a much weaker hybridization. The expression of two of these oncogenes, c-myc and c-myb was followed during differentiation in myeloid leukemic cells and showed a gradual decrease when compared with the actin gene, which is constitutively transcribed. A large number of cytoplasmic oncogenes is expressed in the leukemic cells lines, i.e. c-abl, c-fms, c-fes, c-src, c-ros, c-H-ras, c-K-ras and N-ras. Of these, transcripts coding for c-abl and c-src were absent in blast cells of acute erythroid leukemias. Transcripts coding for c-erb, c-mos and c-sis could also not be detected. A number of putative oncogenes which are reported to play a role in Moloney and Friend virus induced leukemias for instance pim-1, fis-1, fim-1 and fim-2 were also used for screening. Only expression of pim-1 in Rauscher virus induced myeloid leukemic cells and in primary acute erythroid leukemias could be observed. At the DNA level no rearrangement or amplification of any of the oncogenes investigated could be detected. The results show that a number of oncogenes are expressed simultaneously in the same leukemic tissue or cell lines. It therefore seems likely that the presence of transcripts of different oncogenes is associated with the progression of leukemia, but is not the primary cause of leukemogenesis or of the transformation of these cells into established cell lines.","['de Both, N J', 'van der Feltz, M J', 'Mooren, A', 'Vermaas, D', 'Klaassen, P', 'Rhijnsburger, E H', 'Kranendonk-Odijk, M E']","['de Both NJ', 'van der Feltz MJ', 'Mooren A', 'Vermaas D', 'Klaassen P', 'Rhijnsburger EH', 'Kranendonk-Odijk ME']","['Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cytoplasm', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90031-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(1):53-64. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90031-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools revealed that the pyrimidine triphosphate pools were significantly decreased in the P388/VP-16 cell line and the Ara-CTP concentration of two variant cell lines were not significantly different. The Ara-CTP/dCTP ratio was significantly increased in P388/VP-16 cells.

Simultaneous exposure to optimal concentrations of PMA and either DMSO or RA potentiated PMA-induced differentiation into monocyte-macrophages. Granulocytic inducers combined with lower concentration of PMA competed with the latter for the differentiation pathway, producing monocyte-macrophages, granulocytes, paramyeloid and giant multinucleated cells. Lineage specificity of cells treated sequentially with two discrete exposures to alternative inducers depended on the order of exposure. The first exposure initiated differentiation into the pathway specific for the inducer used. The second exposure determined lineage specificity and stimulated terminal differentiation. Thus, treatment with RA for 24-72 h followed by PMA resulted in monocyte-macrophage differentiation; reversed order of exposure resulted in granulocytic differentiation.

To determine the level in the infectious process at which an antiviral agent can interfere most effectively with perinatal viral transmission, we examined the effect of the drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) on transmission of Moloney murine leukemia virus from viremic mothers to offspring. Although AZT treatment did not affect the titer of virus in milk, it did suppress the development of viremia in all offspring. AZT, however, did not prevent transmission of virus from viremic mothers to 25% of the offspring, but did lead to a marked reduction in virus load in these infected mice. These results provide evidence for effective antiretroviral therapy during gestation and in the perinatal period and are of potential significance for the management of maternal transmission of human retroviruses.","['Sharpe, A H', 'Hunter, J J', 'Ruprecht, R M', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Sharpe AH', 'Hunter JJ', 'Ruprecht RM', 'Jaenisch R']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/microbiology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Milk/microbiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Zidovudine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.3.1049-1053.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Mar;63(3):1049-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.3.1049-1053.1989.,"['5 R35 CA44339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-19015/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-72664/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC247797,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to hairy cells' (HC) weak expression of several antigens positive for T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes, the use of a double marker specific for hairy cells was needed to distinguish the different subpopulations. Analysis of LDA in peripheral blood (PB) showed a total normalization of the T cell and monocyte numbers within 90 days, the number of NK cells normalized in 90 to 180 d, whereas normalization of B cell number was seen only after 180 to 360 d of treatment. Mean pretreatment 2-5A synthetase activity was normal or low, but upon treatment the levels rose immediately to higher than normal values and remained high throughout the study. Pretreatment NK activity was low, but normalized after between 90 to 360 d, except in 2 patients with severe splenomegaly. In vitro incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) with IFN-alpha induced activation of the NK and 2-5A synthetase activity in untreated patients, but with treatment these effects were gradually abolished, indicating an increasing effect of IFN-alpha in vivo with time. These results shows that the different PBMNC subpopulations and important immunological functions normalize with treatment. This normalization is, however, not seen until at least after 1 year of treatment, indicating that the treatment schedule should be longer. As no exhaustion to the effect of IFN was seen, as measured by the 2-5A synthetase activity, a continuing beneficial effect of treatment is anticipated. The increasing effect of IFN-alpha after the first signs of clinical effect suggests that the doses used in the present study were higher than necessary.","['Nielsen, B', 'Hokland, M', 'Justesen, J', 'Hasselbalch, H', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Hokland, P']","['Nielsen B', 'Hokland M', 'Justesen J', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Ellegaard J', 'Hokland P']","['University Department of Medicine and Hematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*blood"", 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00247.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 Jan;42(1):50-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00247.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was done by following the fate of radiolabeled phospholipid molecules, previously inserted into the outer monolayer of the plasma membranes by using a non-specific lipid transfer protein. The transbilayer equilibration of these probe molecules was monitored by treating the cells--under essentially non-lytic conditions--with phospholipases A2 of different origin. Rapid reorientations of the newly introduced aminophospholipids in favour of the inner membrane leaflet were observed in fresh mouse erythrocytes; the inward translocation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in this membrane proceeded relatively slow. In FELCs, on the other hand, all three glycerophospholipids equilibrated over both halves of the plasma membrane very rapidly, i.e. within 1 h; nevertheless, an asymmetric distribution in favour of the inner monolayer was only observed for phosphatidylserine (PS). Lowering the ATP-level in the FELCs caused a reduction in the rate of inward translocation of both aminophospholipids, but not of that of PC, indicating that this translocation of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is clearly ATP-dependent. Hence, the situation in the plasma membrane of the FELC is rather unique in a sense that, though an ATP-dependent translocase is present and active both for PS and PE, its activity results in an asymmetric distribution of PS, but not of PE. This remarkable situation might be the consequence of the fact that, in contrast to the mature red cell, this precursor cell still lacks a complete membrane skeletal network.","['Middelkoop, E', 'Coppens, A', 'Llanillo, M', 'Van der Hoek, E E', 'Slotboom, A J', 'Lubin, B H', 'Op den Kamp, J A', 'Van Deenen, L L', 'Roelofsen, B']","['Middelkoop E', 'Coppens A', 'Llanillo M', 'Van der Hoek EE', 'Slotboom AJ', 'Lubin BH', 'Op den Kamp JA', 'Van Deenen LL', 'Roelofsen B']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', '*Phospholipid Transfer Proteins']",1989/01/30 00:00,1989/01/30 00:01,['1989/01/30 00:00'],"['1989/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(89)90121-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(89)90121-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jan 30;978(2):241-8. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(89)90121-1.,"['HL 27059/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL20985/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When sensitive cells were treated in the presence of high potassium (120 mM K+), there was a greater than 80% reduction of DiOC6(3) uptake. Using carbonylcyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial membrane potential, DiOC6(3) accumulation was reduced by less than 30% in these cells. Both results support the conclusion that a greater uptake of DiOC6(3) in ADM-sensitive than in -resistant cells indicates an increased plasma transmembrane potential. Since electronegative plasma membrane potentials are a driving force for the transport of lipophilic positively-charged compounds, differences in membrane potentials between sensitive and multiple drug resistant (MDR) tumor cells could have an important influence on drug accumulation and cytotoxicity. The drugs which our ADM-resistant FLC display multiple drug resistance to are positively charged. In MDR FLC, the calcium channel antagonist, verapamil, has been shown to block the efflux of Rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) and other positively-charged compounds. Since DiOC6(3) is also positively-charged, we used verapamil to investigate its effects on drug uptake. In MDR FLC, verapamil increased DiOC6(3) accumulation by 1.9-fold, whereas in sensitive cells it was increased 1.5-fold. In contrast, verapamil increased the levels of Rho 123 in resistant cells 7.8-fold but lowered them in sensitive cells 1.5-fold. The minimal loss of DiOC6(3) from both sensitive and MDR cells and the above results can best be interpreted as indicating that DiOC6(3) is not transported by the efflux ""pump"" system but that verapamil induces a plasma membrane potential increase in sensitive and resistant cells that DiOC6(3) is sensitive to. On the other hand, since Rho 123 did appear to be actively effluxed from these resistant cells, the enhancement of this compound by verapamil was more likely due to inhibition of the MDR ""pump."" How, or whether, plasma membrane potentials and the MDR efflux ""pump"" are related remains to be investigated. In the resistant cells, verapamil also induced an increase (13-fold) in the accumulation of the electrically neutral fluorescent probe for calcium, INDO-1/AM. However, verapamil had no effect on the efflux of this compound, which was equivalent in both resistant and sensitive cells. Thus, a new effect of verapamil on drug accumulation in MDR cells is identified here.","['Hasmann, M', 'Valet, G K', 'Tapiero, H', 'Trevorrow, K', 'Lampidis, T']","['Hasmann M', 'Valet GK', 'Tapiero H', 'Trevorrow K', 'Lampidis T']","['Max-Planck Institut fur Biochemie, Mildred-Scheel-Labor fur Krebszellforschung, Martinsried, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Indoles)', '370-86-5 (Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone)', ""54501-79-0 (3,3'-dihexyl-2,2'-oxacarbocyanine)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'N18RMK75W1 (indo-1)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbocyanines/metabolism', 'Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Indoles/metabolism', '*Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90041-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90041-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Jan 15;38(2):305-12. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90041-5.,['37109/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported that, between 1958 and 1984, the incidence of thyroid cancers in these patients was insignificantly greater than the incidence expected in the general population. This increase was attributed to the underlying condition that prompted the examination and not to the administration of 131I. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the total cancer risk in the same cohort of patients examined with diagnostic doses of 131I. To further evaluate the underlying risk of disease in these patients, we compared the incidence of all cancers with that expected in the general population. The average radiation dose was approximately 500 mGy to the thyroid and less than 10 mGy to other organs. In the 35,074 patients, 3,746 cancers occurred following the first 5 years after examination, and the resulting standardized incidence rate (SIR) was 1.01 (95% confidence interval = 0.98-1.04). SIRs were significantly increased for endocrine tumors other than thyroid cancer (1.93) and for lymphomas (1.24), leukemias (1.34), and nervous system tumors (1.19). The risk of leukemia was similar for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (SIR = 1.30) and non-CLL (SIR = 1.34). SIR was significantly decreased for cancers of the female genital organs (0.86). The risk for cancer of all sites and types combined was highest 5-9 years after examination (SIR = 1.07) and did not differ from unity thereafter. With greater than or equal to 10 years of follow-up, risk was not statistically associated with the dose of 131I. Overall, the data exclude cancer risk increments greater than 5% (SIR = 1.05) with 95% confidence.

Ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin caused dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation both from normal bone marrow cells and from the leukemic line K-562 cells. This inhibition exerted by ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin was statistically significant at concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml and above. Ciprofloxacin appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of colony formation among the antimicrobial agents tested. Although the inhibitory effect of pefloxacin on normal hematopoietic stem cells was similar to that of cefazolin and chloramphenicol, the inhibitory effect of pefloxacin on leukemic cells was more prominent than that of cefazolin and chloramphenicol. In a proliferation assay in liquid culture of the cell line HL-60, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Both drugs failed to induce cellular differentiation, as assessed by the nitrogen blue tetrazolium dye reduction assay. In therapeutic concentrations no cumulative toxic effect of the combination of ciprofloxacin with cytosine-arabinoside, vincristine, actinomycin D and doxorubicin on colony formation by HL-60 cells was observed. It is concluded that ciprofloxacin does not exert in vitro inhibitory effect on human leukemic cells when assayed at concentrations of less than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml.

An important feature determining the sensitivity and precision of the ELISA was the reduction of non-specific protein-protein binding, particularly in the inhibition assays, thus eliminating high backgrounds obtained with presently available methodology. Washing of the solid phase-bound antigen and blocking of the non-specific binding sites using a potassium phosphate buffer containing heparin largely contributed to this increased sensitivity. The inhibition assays were conducted using antigen concentrations over the range of 0.9-120 ng. The assay is highly specific and can be performed using monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Non-specific reactions were observed only when high concentrations of antigen (greater than 100 ng) were present in the inhibition mixture.

The intracellular form, detected between 1 and 4 h after labeling, was similar but had a slightly lower Mr. It also bound reversibly to C3iBb-Sepharose, and polymers could be demonstrated by cross-linking. Pulse-chase experiments suggested the existence of an earlier, but undetectable, intracellular precursor(s). This form could not be immunoprecipitated even when harsh solubilization conditions and/or antibodies against reduced and denatured P were utilized. Studies with endoglycosidases F and H and tunicamycin indicated that the detectable intracellular precursor contains high mannose N-linked carbohydrate that is processed to the complex form before secretion. The sugars are not required for polymerization, secretion, or functional activity, or responsible for the electrophoretic heterogeneity.

A half-maximal and a maximal (approximately 3.4-fold) stimulation of ethanolamine phospholipid degradation required 3 and 10-20 nM TPA, respectively. TPA had a similar concentration-dependent stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in cells previously prelabeled with [methyl-14C]choline. Increased phospholipid degradation was not accompanied by the formation of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that a phospholipase A-type enzyme was not involved. About 80% of total water-soluble degradation products was ethanolamine, suggesting that phospholipid hydrolysis was catalyzed by a phospholipase D-type enzyme. Increased formation of ethanolamine with exposure of cells to TPA was observed only after a 10-min lag period.

The finding that the growth of clonogenic Molt-4 cells was almost completely abolished following treatment with interferon (IFN)-alpha rA in the dose of 10(3) U/ml, whereas growth of K-562 cells was only slightly affected by similar treatment, suggested that NK cells may mediate inhibition of clonogenic leukemias through various mechanisms.","['Savary, C A', 'Lotzova, E']","['Savary CA', 'Lotzova E']","['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Feb;17(2):183-7.,['CA 39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern analysis after Eco RI or Bam HI and Hind III digestion demonstrated that two clones, Y1 and Y2, stably incorporated a single copy of intact pSV2 neomycin DNA into different sites. Exposure of parental WEHI-3B D+ cells to retinoic acid, aclacinomycin A, or adriamycin resulted in their differentiation to mature granulocytic cells. Clone Y1 had growth kinetics and numbers of differentiated cells comparable to those of the parental line when exposed to these differentiation-inducing agents. Furthermore, this clone was leukemogenic in BALB/c mice. The disease presented as a moderate anemia, a peripheral blood granulocytosis, a shift in the differential to immature granulocytic forms, and a thrombocytopenia. Although there was no change in bone marrow cellularity, in situ hybridization to identify the presence of the neomycin resistance gene mRNA indicated infiltration of leukemia cells (up to 30%) into this tissue compartment. The observed hematological parameters were indicative of a late stage of disease resembling human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Clone Y1, therefore, would appear to be an in vivo model of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia that may be useful for the development of therapeutic strategies to more successfully treat these diseases. Because we have demonstrated that this line is capable of differentiation in vitro and can be stably carried in vivo, it would also be useful for the identification of therapeutic agents capable of initiating the differentiation of leukemia cells in situ.","['Gamba-Vitalo, C', 'Carman, M D', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Gamba-Vitalo C', 'Carman MD', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Gentamicins)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/classification/drug effects/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gentamicins/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Neomycin/genetics', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Transfection']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Feb;17(2):130-7.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response to the hormone by K562 cells and spleen cells was colinear. Using the Krystal bioassay, 14 young hemoglobin S homozygotes had Ep activity levels of 17.9-113.8 mU/ml serum, whereas the new method with K562 cells gave a range of 19.2-115.3 mU/ml.

Although these two molecules are structurally related and both cause a decrease in ornithine decarboxylase activity, they did not similarly affect ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. In the presence of 4 mM N,N'-hexamethylenebisacetamide, at the concentration generally used to induce differentiation in these cells, a decreased steady-state level of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA, due to decreased gene transcription, was observed. In the presence of N-acetyl-1,6-hexanediamine the decrease in enzyme activity was shown to be associated with a decrease in the half-life of the enzyme in the absence of a change in gene transcription. These results show that in proliferating cultured cells changes in ornithine-decarboxylase-gene transcription can be uncoupled from changes in cell growth and that N-acetyl-1,6-hexanediamine only regulates ornithine decarboxylase expression post-transcriptionally.","['Papazafiri, P', 'Osborne, H B']","['Papazafiri P', 'Osborne HB']","['Laboratoire de Biologie et Genetique du Developpement, Unite associe 256, Universite de Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '49631-88-1 (N-acetyl-1,6-diaminohexane)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1989/01/02 00:00,1989/01/02 00:01,['1989/01/02 00:00'],"['1989/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14510.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Jan 2;178(3):789-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14510.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both molecules were highly glycosylated, being synthesized as polypeptides of 40 to 45 kDa and cotranslationally modified by the addition of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated that each was approximately 50% identical to the corresponding mLAMP-1 or mLAMP-2 of mouse cells. Electron microscopic studies of human blood monocytes, HL-60, and U937 cells demonstrated that the principal location of these glycoproteins was intracellular, in vacuoles and lysosomal structures but not in the peroxidase-positive granules of monocytes. Transport of the proteins between organelles was evidenced by their marked accumulation in the membranes of phagolysosomes. A fraction of each glycoprotein was also detected on the plasma membrane of U937 and HL-60 cells but not on a variety of other tissue culture cells. This cell-surface expression may be differentiation related, since the proteins were not detected in the plasma membrane of normal blood monocytes and their expression on U937 and HL-60 cells was reduced when the cells were treated with differentiating agents. Cell-surface expression of both glycoproteins was markedly increased in blood monocytes but not in U937 cells after exposure to the lysosomotropic reagent methylamine HCl, indicating differences in LAMP-associated membrane flow in these cell types.","['Mane, S M', 'Marzella, L', 'Bainton, D F', 'Holt, V K', 'Cha, Y', 'Hildreth, J E', 'August, J T']","['Mane SM', 'Marzella L', 'Bainton DF', 'Holt VK', 'Cha Y', 'Hildreth JE', 'August JT']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Lysosomes/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(89)90597-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(89)90597-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1989 Jan;268(1):360-78. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(89)90597-3.,"['5 RO1 GM31168/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 10486/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate its potential as an antileukemic drug, we first studied the effects of DFO on the in vitro growth of normal human hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM and BFU-E) and clonogenic cells from human leukemic cell lines. Then we evaluated the effects of DFO on progression of leukemia refractory to conventional therapy in two individuals. Micromolar concentrations of DFO determined a dose-dependent inhibition of normal progenitor growth, with inhibitory dose 50% (ID50) for CFU-GM and BFU-E being 6.7 and 5.5 microM/liter, respectively. Marked inhibitory effects were observed on clonogenic cells from HL-60 (ID50 = 1.4 microM/liter) and U-937 (ID50 = 3.6 microM/liter) human leukemic cell lines grown in semisolid medium. When DFO was given intravenously to a patient with lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, a marked reduction in circulating blast count was observed. On the contrary, no in vivo effect was observed in a patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia having transfusional iron overload. We conclude that: (a) DFO is an inhibitor of both normal and leukemic myeloid cell proliferation in vitro; (b) our limited in vivo observations and a previous case study suggest that intravenous administration of DFO to patients with normal to low plasma iron may result in leukemic cytoreduction in vivo.","['Dezza, L', 'Cazzola, M', 'Danova, M', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Brugnatelli, S', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Mazzini, G', 'Riccardi, A', 'Ascari, E']","['Dezza L', 'Cazzola M', 'Danova M', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Brugnatelli S', 'Invernizzi R', 'Mazzini G', 'Riccardi A', 'Ascari E']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)'],IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Feb;3(2):104-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro binding assays and homing experiments with murine lymphoma cell lines suggest that the nonrandom distribution of metastasis could be determined by specificity of cell-endothelium binding. A single subcutaneous inoculum of L2C cells in strain II guinea pigs resulted in a predictable stereotyped pattern of metastasis. Leukemic cell infiltrates were mainly observed around veins at specific locations in each organ: in brain, the most superficial leptomeningeal veins; in liver, veins of the portal triads; in lung, peribronchial veins; in kidney, veins of the renal columns; in adrenal gland, capsular veins and veins of the medulla. Those vessels also showed intense leukemic cell binding and diapedesis. This would suggest that the leukemic infiltrates were the result of transvenular traffic in these regions. Because leukemic cells were both in the intra- and extravascular compartments, the direction of the cell migration could not be determined. When L2C cells were injected into the right auricle of normal guinea pigs, leukemic cell binding occurred almost exclusively in veins located in areas of metastasis predilection. In addition, extravasation by diapedesis occurred in high endothelial venules in lymphoid organs, peribronchial veins and veins in the portal triads. Neither leukemic cell binding nor diapedesis occurred at the sinusoidal or capillary levels; extravasation in these vessels results from intravascular proliferation and secondary damage of the vessel wall, not by diapedesis.

The HL-60 cDNA clones that were isolated were used to design a synthetic primer representing the 3'-untranslated region of the HL-60 lectin. This primer was then used to synthesize a lambda GT10 human placenta cDNA library, and restriction fragments of the HL-60 cDNA clones were used to screen the library. The cDNA clones for both HL-60 and placenta lectin had identical sequences with short 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and coded for a 135-amino acid protein which lacks a hydrophobic signal peptide sequence.

Two experimental approaches, i.e. cell-free translation and subcellular distribution, have identified processing anomalies in the glycophorins. First, signal sequences, if present, are apparently not cleaved upon translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; second, the 26K and 27K putative precursors are inefficiently translocated. The majority accumulates in the cytosol or associates with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane without acquiring protection against V8 protease.

We now report a series of national case-control studies based on the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR). These involved 19,904 male patients with cancer for the period 1980-1984 who were aged 20 years or more at the time of registration. For each cancer site, the registrations for the remaining sites formed the control group. Current or most recent occupational titles were coded. There was an increased risk for STS (OR = 3.24) in forestry workers which was confined to men under 60 years of age at registration. An elevation in risk for NHL (OR = 1.84) was due to an increase in risk for lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma (ICD 200) (OR = 3.18). Acute myeloid leukemia was also associated with forestry work, although the estimate of risk was imprecise (OR = 2.24). Among other cancer sites, an increase in risk of neoplasia of the upper gastro-intestinal tract (ICD 150, 151, 152) was demonstrated. Odds ratios were elevated for cancer of the esophagus (OR = 1.77), stomach (OR = 2.22), small intestine (OR = 5.22), gall-bladder (OR = 4.13) and pancreas (OR = 1.79), as well as for nasopharyngeal cancer (OR = 5.56). These increases in cancer risk were not present in sawmill workers in New Zealand during the same period. The factors responsible for the increased cancer risks in forestry workers remain unclear and require further study.","['Reif, J', 'Pearce, N', 'Kawachi, I', 'Fraser, J']","['Reif J', 'Pearce N', 'Kawachi I', 'Fraser J']","['Department of Environmental Health, Colorado State University, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Fort Collins, CO 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', '*Agriculture', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Registries', 'Sarcoma/*epidemiology/etiology']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910430112 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Jan 15;43(1):49-54. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our series comprised 36 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The mean follow-up time was 54 months (range 5 to 96 months). The median concentration of CSF-FN at diagnosis was 2.24 mg/l (range 0.78 to 7.04 mg/l). The 3-year continuous complete remission rate for the 16 patients with CSF-FN concentrations less than or equal to 2 mg/l was 93% as compared with 37% for the 19 patients with CSF-FN greater than 2 mg/l (p = 0.001). When multivariate analysis was performed, the CSF-FN concentration retained its prognostic significance. When all relapses were considered as failures, the relative risks of relapse for patients with CSF-FN less than or equal to 2 mg/l and greater than 2 mg/l were I and 15.8 (95% confidence limits 1.8-135.6, p less than 0.02), respectively. If only CNS relapses (isolated and combined) were considered as failures, relative risks for the above-mentioned groups were I and 11.6 (1.4-99.5, p less than 0.05), respectively. We conclude that determination of the CSF-FN concentration may provide a new means of evaluating the CSF in children with ALL and may prove to be a sensitive indicator of leukemic CNS infiltration.","['Rautonen, J', 'Koskiniemi, M', 'Siimes, M A', 'Salonen, E M', 'Vaheri, A']","['Rautonen J', 'Koskiniemi M', 'Siimes MA', 'Salonen EM', 'Vaheri A']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Fibronectins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910430108 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Jan 15;43(1):32-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These WR FLC had lost their capacity to metastasize when injected i.v. or s.c. into DBA/2 mice. We have characterized the plasma membrane glycoproteins of the different FLC types by: (i) metabolic labelling with (3H)-galactose; (ii) surface labelling with galactose oxidase-borohydride; (iii) direct binding of (125I)-lectins on glycoproteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The ensemble of these approaches showed that the 100- to 200-kDa glycoproteins of in vivo-passaged FLC and WR FLC exhibited a very similar distribution of the terminal galactose in their oligosaccharide moieties. In contrast, the expression of terminal sialic acid was reduced in WR FLC with respect to in vivo-passaged counterparts as appreciated by: (i) binding experiments with (125I)-WGA; (ii) cathodic shift of the 100- to 200-kDa glycoproteins in 2-dimensional electrophoresis studies, and (iii) thiobarbituric acid assay after FLC treatment with neuraminidase. Moreover, binding experiments with (125I)-LPHA, (125I)-ConA and (125I)-WGA (after Smith degradation) indicated that, in the 100- to 200-kDa region, virtually identical asparagine-linked tri- or tetra-antennary complex-type oligosaccharides were expressed in both cell types.

Stomach cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in Costa Rica; although rates are declining, they are second only to those observed in Japan. There are marked variations in risk by region, suggesting important environmental influences in etiology. The cervix is the major female site; rates are declining in young women, probably due to the introduction of screening programs, although these do not seem to account for the geographic variations in invasive cancer incidence. Breast and prostate cancer show moderate rates, while those for colon and rectum cancer are low; increases in mortality rates for these sites are small, and involve mainly the older age groups. In contrast, rates of lung cancer are increasing dramatically in both sexes. In the childhood age group, very high incidence rates are observed for two neoplasms: Hodgkin's disease and acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Sierra, R', 'Parkin, D M', 'Leiva, G M']","['Sierra R', 'Parkin DM', 'Leiva GM']","['Institute of Health Research, University of Costa Rica, San Jose.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Costa Rica', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Feb 1;49(3):717-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since cyclosporin A and verapamil reverse primary acquired and secondary cross-resistance to daunorubicin, we investigated the effect of these agents on nucleolar B23 translocation in sensitive and resistant tumors. We compared modified to baseline B23 phosphoprotein distribution between predominantly nucleolar, mixed nucleolar-nuclear, or nuclear immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-B23 antibody in parental drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant acute lymphatic leukemia and in daunorubicin-sensitive and -resistant murine hepatoma. Our experiments show that cyclosporin A and verapamil alone have no effect on B23 phosphoprotein translocation, but that the addition of either agent to sensitive parental or resistant tumor sublines markedly enhances daunorubicin-stimulated translocation. This effect correlates with the correction of impaired daunorubicin inhibition of RNA synthesis by cyclosporin A and verapamil in the resistant sublines. Our observations suggest that nucleolar B23 phosphoprotein is an important site in the modulation of anthracycline antibiotic antitumor activity.","['Sweet, P', 'Chan, P K', 'Slater, L M']","['Sweet P', 'Chan PK', 'Slater LM']","['Department of Medicine, California College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Feb 1;49(3):677-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to determine whether this process was one of tumor progression, we sought to: (a) establish whether a clonal relationship exists between readily transplantable aggressive SJL/J lymphomas and their respective indolent predecessors; and (b) identify genetic events critical to the process of acquisition of increased malignancy. Examination of putatively distinct, aggressive, H-2Ds-negative lymphomas, including the long term transplantable line RCS5, revealed them to have the same heavy and light immunoglobulin chain gene rearrangement patterns, a characteristic karyotype marked by nine chromosomal abnormalities, and approximately ten newly acquired ecotropic murine leukemia proviruses at similar genomic sites. Independent, spontaneously arising H-2Ds-positive lymphomas, in early transplant, were found to be genetically distinct from the respective more malignant H-2Ds-negative tumors to which they gave rise during successive transplantation. The data are interpreted as indicating that the aggressive H-2Ds-negative tumors in this study originated from a common source, most likely the RCS5 tumor, rather than through progression of separate spontaneously arising SJL/J lymphomas. It cannot be concluded which of the multiple genetic abnormalities of the H-2Ds-negative tumors were critical to their highly malignant phenotype.

However, the pSM3 fms probe used to detect this gene transcript contains a significant amount of the pol gene of the Susan McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus from which it was derived. Using a fms probe which does not contain any viral pol sequences, no such ""fms-related"" transcripts were detected in cell lines previously reported to express the large transcripts. These cell lines did express a large 9.5-kilobase transcript which hybridized to a probe for murine leukemia virus. Partial sequence analysis of the 9.5-kilobase transcript detected with the pSM3 probe in transformed rat cells indicated sequence homology with AKV murine leukemia virus. Thus, the presence of large RNA transcripts, interpreted by us and others as being related to the oncogene fms, appears to be due to the expression of mouse retroviral sequences which hybridize to the viral pol region contained in the pSM3 fms probe. In the case of rat and human cells, such sequences appear to be acquired after the cells have been passaged in nude mice. These results should serve as a reminder of the important biohazard and data interpretation implications for investigations in which cells transfected with retroviral vector constructs are injected into nude mice, because rescue of the recombinant sequences in these cells could occur following infection by endogenous murine retroviral particles.","['Walker, C', 'Nettesheim, P', 'Barrett, J C', 'Jirik, F R', 'Sorge, J', 'Joyce, M', 'Gilmer, T']","['Walker C', 'Nettesheim P', 'Barrett JC', 'Jirik FR', 'Sorge J', 'Joyce M', 'Gilmer T']","['National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Laboratory of Pulmonary Pathobiology, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Probes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Feb 1;49(3):625-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uptake of DXR and IDX into the nucleus of K562 cells and DXR-resistant K562/DXR cells could then be studied with a sensitive, nondestructive technique. Growth inhibitory concentrations of K562 and K562/DXR cells, when measured with respect to drug content in the medium, differed by a factor of 25 in the case of DXR and by a factor of three in the case of IDX. By contrast, intranuclear drug concentrations measured at corresponding growth inhibitory concentrations are found to be nearly constant, i.e., independent of cellular-resistant phenotype and of anthracycline structure.

CLB labeled with 14C in either the chloroethyl group or phenyl ring was used with identical results. Drug accumulation by the cells was found to peak at 30 s, was independent of temperature, and was proportional to medium CLB concentration over a wide range. Efflux from cells loaded with CLB and resuspended in drug-free medium was nearly complete at 30 s. The metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose and NaN3, the nitrogen mustard transport inhibitor hemicholinium-3, and another alkylating agent, melphalan, had no effect on drug uptake. We conclude that CLB enters and exits chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes by simple diffusion. Cells from 17 patients with all stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia were studied including three with CLB-resistant disease, and no heterogeneity was found in the peak cell-associated CLB content or in metabolite pattern on high-performance liquid chromatography. These findings make it unlikely that transport or cellular drug metabolism are factors in drug resistance. Drug-DNA binding was found to be temperature-sensitive and increased with time of incubation. Gel filtration of DNA before and after enzymatic digestion indicated the presence of drug-DNA adducts. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of digested DNA and DNA treated by neutral thermal hydrolysis suggested the presence of multiple adducts. Most of the radioactivity was found as purine adducts. Studies with CLB labeled at two different sites revealed the presence of the phenyl group and ethyl chains in the adducts.

Treatment with the cysteine cathepsin inhibitor L-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamido(4-guanido)butane (E64) conferred resistance to C12-Im, showing that, in these cells, as previously demonstrated for Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts, cysteine proteases were major cytotoxic agents involved in killing by C12-Im.

ACRO in this etoposide diluent (VPD) was found to be cytotoxic (less than or equal to 50% colony formation in soft agar) in fresh human tumors from patients with renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and metastatic tumors of unknown primary. In P-glycoprotein-positive, multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines, ACRO in VPD was active in MDR Chinese hamster ovary cells but not against MDR L1210 murine leukemia cells, 8226 human myeloma cells, or human CCRF-CEM lymphoblasts. In mice, ACRO in VPD was active in two solid tumor models and an i.p. MOPC-315 plasmacytoma model. ACRO i.p. in 10% VPD (v/v%) produced significant tumor growth delays in (a) nude mice bearing human MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts and (b) C57BL mice bearing colon 38 tumor. In MOPC-315-bearing mice, a single i.p. ACRO dose of 25 mg/kg was as effective as melphalan (15 mg/kg) at prolonging life span. Finally, ACRO pharmacokinetics was evaluated in mice given single 25-mg/kg doses i.p. or p.o. The oral bioavailability of an ACRO solution in VPD was only 50% but both i.p. and p.o. regimens achieved plasma levels greater than 1.0 micrograms/ml. The plasma half-life was just under 2 h. These results show that parenteral ACRO in VPD comprises a cytotoxic antitumor agent with improved bioavailability over p.o. administration. ACRO is active in vitro against several human solid tumors but is cross-resistant in 3 of 4 MDR tumor cell lines. The prior clinical activity of p.o.

The human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 expresses a structurally altered c-abl protein with tyrosine kinase activity. When K562 cells are induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by hemin, reduction in the intracellular level of tyrosine phosphorylation occurs. In order to understand the relationship between induction of differentiation and reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation by the c-abl gene product, the effect that herbimycin A, a selective inhibitor of intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, exerts on the differentiation of K562 cells was examined. Reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells by herbimycin A was observed within 1 h. Noncytotoxic concentrations of herbimycin A induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells but not of murine erythroleukemia 745A cells. The other human myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60, THP-1, and U937) tested were not induced to undergo cell differentiation by this antibiotic. Herbimycin A and the other well-known inducers such as hemin, butyric acid, Adriamycin, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine had additive or more than additive effects on induction of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. With respect to inhibition of cell growth, the sensitivity of K562 cells to herbimycin A was highest in the human leukemia cell lines we tested. Noncytotoxic concentrations of herbimycin enhanced the antiproliferative effect of Adriamycin or 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine on K562 cells. Combination therapy with herbimycin A and its derivatives may be considered for use in the treatment of some types of leukemia where tyrosine kinase activities are implicated as determinants of the oncogenic state.","['Honma, Y', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hozumi, M', 'Uehara, Y', 'Mizuno, S']","['Honma Y', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hozumi M', 'Uehara Y', 'Mizuno S']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzoquinones', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives']",1989/01/15 00:00,1989/01/15 00:01,['1989/01/15 00:00'],"['1989/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jan 15;49(2):331-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Influx of araC at 1 microM into cultured human ovarian carcinoma cells (CI 80-13S) was largely inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine, while the residual influx (approximately 10%) was inhibited only by micromolar concentrations of nitrobenzylthioinosine. There was a two fold greater density of specific [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding to the nucleoside transporters on the ovarian than on cultured human leukemic cells (RC2a). Calculated turnover rates of the nucleoside transporter for 1 microM araC were 5-fold less in ovarian than in leukemic cells. The major metabolic product of araC was 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (araCTP) which accumulated in the ovarian cells to levels half those achieved in the leukemic cells. AraC was the major product of araCTP degradation in ovarian cells consistent with a pathway (araCTP--------araCMP----araC) which is different from that previously found in leukemic cells (araCTP--------araCMP----araUMP----araU).

All patients received vincristine and prednisone induction, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate maintenance, and vincristine and prednisone pulse intensification. There was no significant difference in the rate of bone marrow relapse. However, overall disease-free survival favored the arm with intensification and chemoprophylaxis because of a lesser incidence of extramedullary relapse. Thus, for treatment 1 versus treatment 3 the two-sided P values were for overall disease-free survival 0.16; bone marrow relapses 0.13; all CNS relapses 0.04; and all extramedullary disease relapses 0.013.

Translocations were detected in six patients, involving 4q21-23 and 11q23 in three and two cases, respectively. The probability of five-year DFS were 27% for the whole group. The worst prognosis was observed in infants younger than 6 months of age, in whom the leukemia cell characteristics was compatible with stem cell: ANLL, very early pre-B, or undifferentiated mixed type. The chromosomal aberrations found in all cases included translocation with the seemingly nonrandom breakpoints at 4q21 and 11q23, and breakpoints that corresponded to known fragile sites.

Additionally, hematopoietic progenitor cells in DBA/2 mice infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of the Friend virus complex (FVC-P) were insensitive to the in vivo administration of rHF.

Since rHF suppresses hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation from normal donors in vitro and from normal mice in vitro and in vivo but does not suppress progenitor cells from patients with leukemia in vitro or from mice with FVC-P-infection in vitro or in vivo, rHF may be useful as a candidate adjunct molecule for the protection of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells during chemotherapy.","['Broxmeyer, H E', 'Williams, D E', 'Geissler, K', 'Hangoc, G', 'Cooper, S', 'Bicknell, D C', 'Levi, S', 'Arosio, P']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Williams DE', 'Geissler K', 'Hangoc G', 'Cooper S', 'Bicknell DC', 'Levi S', 'Arosio P']","['Department of Medicine, Walther Oncology Center, Indianapolis, IN 46223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Ferritins/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Polycythemia/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80426-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jan;73(1):74-9.,"['CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK-07519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When used under experimental conditions that are known to preserve most mature blood cells, at least some coagulation factors, and a significant portion of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell compartment, MC 540-mediated photosensitization reduced virus titers by greater than or equal to 4 log and the concentration of in vitro clonogenic erythroleukemia cells by greater than or equal to 5 log. Animals that received a single intravenous injection of photosensitized virus were resistant to a subsequent challenge with live virus. High sensitivity to MC 540-mediated photosensitization appears to be a property that is shared by other enveloped viruses.

In contrast, 19% of patients who had -5/5q- and or -7/7q- and seven patients with trisomy 8 were older, had a poor prognosis, and usually failed to achieve remission (CR) because of chemotherapy-resistant leukemia. The adverse effect on CR rate and duration in this group of patients was independent of age, and there was no association with particular morphologic subtypes.

Circulating cachectin activity was not detectable in the serum of non-tumor-bearing rats or in tumor-bearing rats until 28 days after implantation. With evidence of food intake and body weight decline, cachectin activity became detectable in the serum and levels increased as cachexia and tumor burden increased. Serum cachectin activity levels correlated directly with tumor burden and inversely with food intake and body weight change. After resection of the tumor, food intake and body weight increased and serum cachectin activity became undetectable.

Unexpectedly wide variations were found: in ANLL, unrelated clones were present in 1.1% of the 2,506 known cases with chromosome abnormalities characterized with banding technique; in the various myelodysplastic (MDS) and chronic myeloproliferative (CMD) disorders (total number of cases 1,299) the frequency was 4.3% and in lymphatic malignancies 1.3% (total case number 2,501). In the latter group the proportions varied between 0.4% and 0.6% in ALL and malignant lymphoma (ML) to as much as 6.2% in CLD and 7.3% in CLL. Some karyotypic abnormalities were encountered more often than would be expected from their general frequency in the various diseases. This discrepancy was particularly evident in MDS and CMD, where 5q- was found in slightly less and +8 in somewhat more than half of the 56 cases. Furthermore, these two aberrations were found as the only changes in the two coexisting clones in one-fourth of the material. Although if viewed in isolation these data would undoubtedly be best explained by assuming a multicellular origin of the neoplasm, it is entirely possible that what are cytogenetically perceived as unrelated clones could be subclones with some invisible aberration in common. If so, this interpretation indicates that changes like +8 and 5q-, both of which are common rearrangements in bone marrow neoplasms, are actually secondary changes that develop during tumor progression.","['Heim, S', 'Mitelman, F']","['Heim S', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/classification/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells/classification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/*genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jan;3(1):6-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have measured serum and urine glycosaminoglycan levels by the carbazole method of uronic acid determination in patients with myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia. Eleven patients were studied during active disease as well as eight in complete remission. Serum levels in patients with active disease did not differ significantly from 11 healthy volunteers with no hematological disease. In contrast, the median urine level for the patients with active disease was 7.6 mg uronate/g Creatinine (Creat) compared to 2.6 for controls (p less than 0.002). Interestingly, the eight patients in complete remission also had a significant increase in uronate excretion with a median of 7.3 (p less than 0.002). These results suggest that elevated urinary glycosaminoglycan levels in leukemia are not due to impaired ability of the liver to clear circulating glycosaminoglycans or overproduction by leukemic cells. The observed increase in glycosaminoglycan excretion may be due to altered bone marrow matrix metabolism that is often not reversed by the achievement of hematologic remission.","['Luikart, S D', 'Fosdick, L', 'Ogle, K M', 'Peterson, B A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Luikart SD', 'Fosdick L', 'Ogle KM', 'Peterson BA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Uronic Acids)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*blood/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy/urine', 'Remission Induction', 'Uronic Acids/blood/urine']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jan;3(1):48-50.,['CA-38972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women treated for breast cancer after 1973 were excluded to minimize the possible confounding influence of treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The cases had histologically confirmed leukemia reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) between 1935 and 1984. A total of 48 cases of leukemia following breast cancer were included in the study. Two controls were individually matched to each leukemia case on the basis of age, calendar year when diagnosed with breast cancer, and survival time. Leukemia diagnoses were verified by one hematologist. Radiation dose to active bone marrow was estimated by medical physicists on the basis of the original radiotherapy records of study subjects. Local radiation doses to each of the 16 bone marrow components for each patient were reconstructed; the dose averaged over the entire body was 530 rad (5.3 Gy). Based on this dosage and assuming a linear relationship between dose and affect, a relative risk (RR) in excess of 10 would have been expected. However, there was little evidence that radiotherapy increased the overall risk of leukemia (RR = 1.16; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 2.1). The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignancies without evidence for an association with ionizing radiation, was not significantly increased (RR = 1.8; n = 10); nor was the risk for all other forms of leukemia (RR = 1.0; n = 38). There was no indication that risk varied over categories of radiation dose. These data exclude an association between leukemia and radiotherapy for breast cancer of 2.2-fold with 90% confidence, and provide further evidence that cell death predominates over cell transformation when high radiation doses are delivered to limited volumes of tissue.","['Curtis, R E', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Stovall, M', 'Flannery, J T', 'Moloney, W C']","['Curtis RE', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Stovall M', 'Flannery JT', 'Moloney WC']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Connecticut', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",1989/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.1.21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Jan;7(1):21-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.1.21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid membrane depolarization is triggered by a multivalent Ag, and it has a bell-shaped dose dependence that parallels the degranulation response but not the extent of cross-linking of the IgE-receptor complexes. As the temperature is reduced from 37 degrees C, this depolarization response slows and decreases in magnitude until complete inhibition is observed at 15 degrees C, similar to the temperature dependence previously observed for the Ag-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and for degranulation. The results imply that a highly temperature-dependent step subsequent to Ag binding and cross-linking is necessary for the depolarization response. A partial return to the resting potential is seen to follow the depolarization response to Ag. This repolarization process is inhibited by quinidine.HCl and Ba2+ in parallel with an inhibition of the degranulation response. Repolarization is not affected by 4-aminopyridine or by the absence of K+ in the external buffer.

DDATHF was found to inhibit the growth of L1210 and CCRF-CEM cells in culture at concentrations in the range of 10-30 nM. The inhibitory effect of DDATHF on the growth of L1210 and CCRF-CEM cells was reversed by either hypoxanthine or aminoimidazole carboxamide. Growth inhibition by DDATHF was prevented by addition of both thymidine and hypoxanthine, but not by thymidine alone. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate reversed the effects of DDATHF in a dose-dependent manner. DDATHF had no appreciable inhibitory activity against either dihydrofolate reductase or thymidylate synthase in vitro, but was found to be an excellent substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. DDATHF had little or no effect on incorporation of either deoxyuridine or thymidine into DNA, in distinct contrast to the effects of the classical dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, methotrexate. DDATHF was found to deplete cellular ATP and GTP over the same concentrations as those inhibitory to leukemic cell growth, suggesting that the locus of DDATHF action was in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The synthesis of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide in intact L1210 cells was inhibited by DDATHF with the same concentration dependence as inhibition of growth. This suggested that DDATHF inhibited glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, the first folate-dependent enzyme of de novo purine synthesis. DDATHF is a potent folate analog which suppresses purine synthesis through direct or indirect inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase.","['Beardsley, G P', 'Moroson, B A', 'Taylor, E C', 'Moran, R G']","['Beardsley GP', 'Moroson BA', 'Taylor EC', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510-8064.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '349-34-8 (phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Purines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",1989/01/05 00:00,1989/01/05 00:01,['1989/01/05 00:00'],"['1989/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)31261-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jan 5;264(1):328-33.,['CA-42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was calculated that these proteins turn over with half-lives of 21.6 days for H2A, 13.8 days for H2B, 43.3 days for H3, and 138.6 days for H4. The significant differences in the half-lives of the four core histones indicate that the protein moiety of the nucleosome is not replaced as one entire unit but as a ""mosaic"" in which each component follows its own rate of replacement. In some experiments the turnover rates of the variants of H2A, H2B, and H3 were compared. The results did not indicate any differences among these histone variants, suggesting that they are not excluded from the mechanisms controlling histone turnover. Metabolic heterogeneity was discovered, however, when the turnover rates of the acetylated and nonacetylated molecules of histone H4 were followed: it appeared that the acetylated molecules are replaced 2.5 times faster. The comparison of the rate of replacement of the histones in proliferating and differentiated cells from one site and their level of acetylation from another suggests that this postsynthetic modification might be involved in the control of histone metabolism. Such a conclusion is supported also by a number of model experiments.","['Tsvetkov, S', 'Ivanova, E', 'Djondjurov, L']","['Tsvetkov S', 'Ivanova E', 'Djondjurov L']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Half-Life', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(89)90215-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(89)90215-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Jan;180(1):94-105. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90215-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug-sequence experiments demonstrated that maximal synergy was achieved when HU was given immediately after CY but immediately before or during AMSA administration. No significant cure rate was seen with any CY/HU or HU/AMSA sequence.

(1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 6839-6843). We have now examined its mechanism of action in further detail and conclude that DCBT acts as a sulfhydryl alkylating reagent. A mixed disulfide forms between the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl mercaptan moiety of DCBT and protein sulfhydryl groups with release of cyanate anion to the medium. Gel filtration and dialysis of complexes of tubulin formed with either [nitrile-14C]DCBT, [35S]DCBT or [benzyl-3H]DCBT demonstrated persistent association of 35S and 3H with denatured tubulin, but no binding of 14C to the protein even under native conditions. With equimolar tubulin and DCBT, beta-tubulin is the predominant alkylated species. At high drug concentrations, superstoichiometric amounts of DCBT react with tubulin, and both subunits are alkylated almost equally. When extracts of drug-treated L1210 murine leukemia cells were examined by polyacrylamide gel electroporesis, we found that multiple proteins were alkylated by DCBT, but the most prominent radiolabeled band was that corresponding to beta-tubulin. Dithiothreitol partially reverses inhibition of tubulin polymerization by DCBT and removes almost all the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl mercaptan moiety covalently bound to tubulin. Mitotic arrest occurs with DCBT because tubulin is the cellular protein most sensitive to the agent, probably because of its high cysteine content (20/mol).","['Bai, R', 'Duanmu, C', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai R', 'Duanmu C', 'Hamel E']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Cyanates)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '0 (Tubulin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '7534-61-4 (2,4-dichlorobenzyl thiocyanate)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cyanates/metabolism', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Thiocyanates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",1989/01/19 00:00,1989/01/19 00:01,['1989/01/19 00:00'],"['1989/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(89)90056-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(89)90056-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jan 19;994(1):12-20. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(89)90056-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have measured the zero-trans and equilibrium exchange flux of formycin B in these cells by rapid kinetic techniques. The Michaelis-Menten constants and maximum velocities for formycin B transport in both types of cell were similar to those previously reported for uridine and thymidine. Nevertheless, the differential mobility of the substrate-loaded and empty carrier of human erythrocytes was less for formycin B than uridine as substrate. Formycin B influx was inhibited by other nucleosides in accordance with their affinities for the carrier, but unaffected by purines. The inhibition of formycin B influx by nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole was also identical to that observed with uridine as substrate (IC50 = 10 and 30 nM, respectively). Formycin B accumulated in both types of cell to 30-40% higher concentrations than were present in the medium.

We have shown previously that lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid modulate normal human hematopoiesis by in vitro colony assays. In this study we investigated the role of lipoxygenase metabolites in regulating the proliferation of several malignant hematopoietic cell lines, including K562 and EM-2 (chronic myelogenous leukemia blasts), HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia cells), and U937 (malignant histiocytes). Piriprost, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, inhibits proliferation of these cell lines up to 95% with 50% cell inhibition at approximately 3 x 10(-5) M. Other less specific lipoxygenase inhibitors such as caffeic acid, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and BW755C have similar activity in a [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay. In contrast, indomethacin, which is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, has no suppressive effect in these assays. Inhibition by these drugs is completely reversible. Several nonhematopoietic malignant cell lines do not appear to be affected by these drugs. Two specific lipoxygenase metabolites, leukotriene B4 and leukotriene D4, stimulate leukemia cell line proliferation to 150% of control levels when added directly to cell cultures. These data suggest that certain lipoxygenase products, perhaps leukotrienes, are critical for the proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells in vitro.","['Snyder, D S', 'Castro, R', 'Desforges, J F']","['Snyder DS', 'Castro R', 'Desforges JF']","['City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandin Antagonists)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukotrienes/pharmacology', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Prostaglandin Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Jan;17(1):6-9.,"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous peripheral B and T cells behaved, respectively, in the same way as BALL and TALL cells. Both BALL and TALL cells while directly interacting with the SG cells were completely inhibited from incorporating [3H]thymidine, although radioactive grains were observed in 16.4%-12.4% of supernatant BALL and 13.8%-13.0% of supernatant TALL cells in each coculture. Furthermore the media conditioned by SG cells significantly increased the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the TALL cells as much as 190% of the control. These results indicate that SG cells undergo tissue-specific cellular interactions with B- and T-lymphoid cell lines but not with a myeloid cell line, and they can modify their growth by two distinct mechanisms.

Four fluctuation tests using a total of 132 replicate HL-60 cultures revealed a mean forward mutation rate of HL-60 cells to thioguanine resistance of 1.7-6 x 10(-7)/cell/generation. Blot hybridization analysis of the X-linked HPRT gene using a human HPRT complementary DNA probe revealed abnormalities in HPRT gene structure and/or HPRT mRNA expression in 24 of 45 (53%) independent thioguanine-resistant HL-60 sublines. Six different classes of mutation were identified. The most prevalent (47%; 21 of 45 mutations) consists of mutations that are not detected by blot hybridization analyses and that do not disrupt HPRT mRNA production. These results suggest that a comparatively low forward mutation rate may be found in malignant human cells that exhibit both karyotypic and molecular evidence of genomic instability and that several different molecular classes of mutation may contribute to thioguanine resistance in HL-60, and perhaps in other, malignant human cells. The forward mutation assay system we have developed using the X-linked HPRT gene of HL-60 cells may be useful for analyses of the mutagenic potential and molecular spectrum of mutations produced by chemotherapeutic agents, suspected human mutagens and carcinogens, and phagocyte respiratory burst oxidants in human cells.","['Monnat, R J Jr']",['Monnat RJ Jr'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phagocytes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X Chromosome']",1989/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jan 1;49(1):81-7.,"['2 POI AG01751/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05432/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, patients received a single dose of etoposide (VP-16, 1 g/m2) prior to the ara-C administration. In four patients, total body irradiation was administered as part of a bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen after the ara-C administration.

The DNA-damaging and cytotoxic potential of procarbazine and its metabolites in murine L1210 leukemia tumor cells in vitro was determined using alkaline elution techniques and extrapolation of growth curves. Neither procarbazine nor any of the chemical degradation products (except for the aldehyde derivative at high concentrations) caused significant amounts of DNA strand breakage. The primary enzymatic oxidation product, azo-procarbazine, did not produce strand breakage. However, exposure of the cells to either of the two isomers of azoxy-procarbazine led to significant DNA damage and cytotoxicity. DNA damage included both single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. At equimolar concentrations, the azoxy 2 isomer of procarbazine caused 14 to 20 times more DNA damage than did the azoxy 1 metabolite. When cell growth is expressed as percentage survival of L1210 cells, the azoxy 2 isomer was approximately 7-fold more toxic than the azoxy 1 metabolite. The other metabolites tested showed little or no cytotoxicity. L1210 cells were shown to contain little or no cytochrome P-450 or monoamine oxidase activity, which may account for the lack of toxicity of the parent drug or the primary oxidative metabolite, azo-PCZ, to these cells. The conversion of procarbazine to the azoxy-procarbazine isomers in vivo must occur in cells which contain these enzymes, such as liver. However, the azoxy isomers of procarbazine were metabolized in L1210 cells, presumably leading to the DNA or cytotoxic damage observed.","['Erikson, J M', 'Tweedie, D J', 'Ducore, J M', 'Prough, R A']","['Erikson JM', 'Tweedie DJ', 'Ducore JM', 'Prough RA']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Louisville, Kentucky 40292.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azo Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Procarbazine/*metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jan 1;49(1):127-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, anti-reovirus cytotoxic effectors have the functional and phenotype characteristics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). A significant fraction of anti-viral CTL, as well as alloreactive CTL, were also found to be positive for the asialo GM1 (ASGM1) cell surface antigen, generally considered to be a NK cell marker. ASGM1 expression on these CTL, as determined by sensitivity to antibody plus complement (C), appeared to be highly variable and dependent on two factors-the nature of the antigenic stimulus (viral vs. alloantigen), and the mouse strain from which the CTL originated. Thus, ASGM1 antigen expression on CTL appears to be regulated and may be under the control of lymphokines, development differentiation signals and/or other strain-dependent genetic factors.","['Parker, S E', 'Sun, Y H', 'Sears, D W']","['Parker SE', 'Sun YH', 'Sears DW']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Immunogenet,Journal of immunogenetics,0425125,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', '*G(M1) Ganglioside', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glycosphingolipids/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Reoviridae/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1744-313x.1988.tb00424.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunogenet. 1988 Aug;15(4):215-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-313x.1988.tb00424.x.,['CA24433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMP dehydrogenase activity in normal leukocytes was 3.1 +/- 0.5 (means +/- S.E.) nmol/hr/mg protein and in leukemic cells it was elevated 15- to 41-fold. The activity of guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in normal leukocytes was 389 +/- 27 nmol/hr/mg protein and in the leukemic cells it increased 2.8- to 6.8-fold. 2. IMP dehydrogenase was purified 4,900-fold to homogeneity from rat hepatoma 3924A with a yield of 30%. The kinetic properties of the hepatoma enzyme were similar to those of the enzyme in human myelocytic leukemic blast cells because of the similarity of the Km's for IMP (23 microM), NAD (44 and 65 microM); the Ki for TAD was 0.1 microM in both enzymes. 3. There was a selectivity of the in vitro response to tiazofurin in human normal and leukemic leukocytes. When labeled tiazofurin was incubated with leukocytes from normal, healthy volunteers and from leukemic patients, the leukemic leukocytes made 20- to 30-fold more TAD and the GTP content decreased as compared to normal leukocytes. This procedure proved to be a suitable predictive test in a clinical setting because patients with positive tests responded to tiazofurin whereas those with negative ones did not. 4. The National Cancer Institute approved a chemotherapeutic phase I/II trial which concentrates on treatment of refractory acute myelocytic leukemia. Tiazofurin is infused in a 60-minute period with a pump to insure uniform delivery. A novel aspect of the trial was that it was directed primarily by the biochemical impact of tiazofurin on IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP concentration and the tiazofurin doses were to be adjusted accordingly. Patients received allopurinol as a routine precaution against possible accumulation of uric acid in the kidney. 5. In the first eight patients, there was one complete remission, two entered the chronic phase, two entered into partial remission, one did not respond, and two were not evaluable. In the five patients who responded, there was a rapid, profound decrease in IMP dehydrogenase activity of the blast cells and a gradual decline in GTP concentrations. The blast cell count followed the decrease in the GTP concentration. The white blood cell count was largely preserved. 6. Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples showed that with tiazofurin treatment there was an induced differentiation of the myelocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Weber, G', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Lapis, E', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Yamada, Y', 'Yamaji, Y', 'Tricot, G J', 'Hoffman, R']","['Weber G', 'Jayaram HN', 'Lapis E', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Yamada Y', 'Yamaji Y', 'Tricot GJ', 'Hoffman R']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Adenine/biosynthesis', 'Aged', 'Allopurinol/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Guanine/biosynthesis', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(88)90029-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1988;27:405-33. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(88)90029-5.,"['CA-13526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRP), and the resultant consumption of NAD, play an essential role in mediating the toxicity of these agents. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes contain a substantial number of alkali-sensitive DNA sites, reflecting ongoing DNA strand breakage and repair. However, resting lymphocytes have a limited capacity to synthesize NAD. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that approximately 75% of their NAD turnover is due to ADPRP activity. Exposure of the cells in vitro to deoxyadenosine, or to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA, an adenosine deaminase resistant deoxyadenosine congener), caused an increase in DNA strand breaks, rapid NAD consumption, ATP depletion and cell death. Supplementation of the medium with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase blocks the fall in cellular NAD and ATP, and protects the lymphocytes from the toxicity of DNA damaging agents. Slowly dividing malignant lymphocytes from patients with CLL are also susceptible to lethal NAD depletion following DNA damage. 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) induced massive DNA strand break formation in CLL cells in vitro and a fall in NAD and ATP pools. In an initial clinical trial, several CLL patients, and two patients with hairy cell leukemia, have responded to treatment with CdA, with minimal toxicity. Thus, the suicidal activation of ADPRP in response to DNA damage has been rationally exploited in the treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.","['Carson, D A', 'Carrera, C J', 'Wasson, D B', 'Yamanaka, H']","['Carson DA', 'Carrera CJ', 'Wasson DB', 'Yamanaka H']","['Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['*Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyadenosines/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'NAD/*metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(88)90028-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1988;27:395-404. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(88)90028-3.,['GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major cyclooxygenase metabolite synthesized by these cells was prostaglandin F2 alpha. Its production increased significantly when the HL-60 cells were treated with PMA and decreased when treated with DMSO as compared to untreated control cells. This change in the production of prostaglandin F2 alpha appears to reflect alterations in cyclooxygenase activity. Another unidentified arachidonic acid metabolite was routinely observed in C18 high pressure liquid chromatography. The synthesis of this compound was inhibited by indomethacin.

For a correct demonstration of activities of these enzymes discriminating substrates must be used. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is revealed with Gly-Pro-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (Gly-Pro-MNA) and Fast Blue B (FBB). It is present in the surface membrane of about 40% lymphocytes of the peripheral blood. Only T-lymphocytes bear the reaction. Reacting lymphocytes belong predominantly to OKT4+ subset. Some OKT8+ lymphocytes also react. With more sensitive substrates (Lys-Pro-MNA, Phe-Pro-MNA and Ala-Pro-MNA) a co-reaction of DPP II was demonstrated ""in situ"" and in zymograms. In haemoblastoses a positive reaction in cells indicates their derivation from the T-lineage of lymphocytes. A negative reaction does not exclude a T-cell malignancy, however. A decreased number of DPP IV positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood indicates a diminished immunocompetent potential of T-cells, e.g. immunodeficiency in patients with malignant lymphoma, gastric and colocrectal carcinoma, AIDS, etc. DPP II demonstrated with Lys-Ala-MNA occurs in about 60% of lymphocytes belonging to T and B subsets. It is localized in lysosomes. Although Lys-Pro-MNA is a more sensitive substrate a co-reaction of DPP IV must always be considered. Patients with chronic B-lymphocytic leukaemia displaying a high number of DPP II+ cells usually have a worse prognosis. DPP I assessed with Gly-Pro-MNA and nitrosalicylaldehyde occurs in about 20% of T and B lymphocytes. The number of positively reacting cells increases after corticosteroid therapy. The influence of the treatment on the activity can be shown very well in histograms of DPP I activity measured by computer-assisted microfluorometry.","['Lojda, Z']",['Lojda Z'],"['School of General Medicine, Charles University, Prague.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Czech Med,Czechoslovak medicine,7805372,"['EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.1 (Cathepsin C)', 'EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl peptidase II)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Cathepsin C', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/ultrastructure']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Czech Med. 1988;11(4):181-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three proteins accounted for most aspects of the footprints. The binding sites of two proteins, termed alpha-CP1 and alpha-CP2, overlapped in the CCAAT box. Further characterization of these two CCAAT binding proteins showed that neither interacted with the adenovirus origin of replication, a strong CCAAT transcription factor-nuclear factor 1 binding site. A third protein, termed alpha-IRP, interacted with two sequences that formed an inverted repeat (IR) between the CCAAT and TATAA boxes. Interestingly, the binding domain of one of the CCAAT factors, alpha-CP1, overlapped one alpha-IRP binding site. alpha-CP1 thus overlapped the binding domains of both alpha-CP2 and alpha-IRP. The IRs included GC-rich sequences reminiscent of SP1-binding sites. Indeed, alpha-IRP bound as well to the alpha-promoter as it did to SP1 sites in the simian virus 40 early promoter. These results suggest that alpha-IRP may be related to the transcription factor Sp1.

Correlation between hepatitis B virus infection and adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV) infection was determined by using the prevalence rates for three virus markers. Overall prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-ATLA was 6.5%, 57.4%, and 17.9%, respectively. Age-specific prevalence of anti-HBc and anti-ATLA increased with age, but that of HBsAg did not. Sex-specific prevalence of HBsAg was significantly higher in males than in females, but that of anti-ATLA was significantly higher in females than in males. Statistical analysis revealed that prevalence of anti-ATLA was significantly higher in HBsAg-positive persons and HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive persons than in those negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc. These data suggest that hepatitis B virus-infected persons have a significantly higher chance of adult T-cell leukemia virus infection than those without hepatitis B virus infection in the area studied.","['Kashiwagi, S', 'Ikematsu, H', 'Hayashi, J', 'Kajiyama, W', 'Nomura, H', 'Noguchi, A', 'Tani, S', 'Goto, M']","['Kashiwagi S', 'Ikematsu H', 'Hayashi J', 'Kajiyama W', 'Nomura H', 'Noguchi A', 'Tani S', 'Goto M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/isolation & purification', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/complications/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/complications/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Male']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1988.tb01453.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1988;32(9):917-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1988.tb01453.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies and present findings support the notion that both this function and the fine architecture of hemopoietic organs, i.e., the spatial arrangement of blood cells within the tissue, may be directed by stromal cells. Despite the ability of cloned stromal cells to support prolonged hempoiesis and maintenance in vitro of stem cells with high radioprotective ability, they are a poor source of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and do not secrete the other species of CSF. Furthermore, cultured stromal cells antagonize the activity of CSF. It is proposed that stromal cell factors distinct from known CSFs, regulate stem cell renewal. An additional phenomenon that is mediated by stromal cells and can not be attributed to CSF, is their ability to specifically inhibit the accumulation of cells of particular lineage and stage of differentiation. A glycoprotein that inhibits the growth of plasmacytomas but not a variety of other cell types was isolated from one type of cloned stromal cells.

Cell lines with the Thy 1.2+ phenotype were established from spleen cells of the leukemic mice, and were designated STIL-3 C5 and STIL-3 D10. They produced and released GM-CSA and IL-3 activities in culture supernatant. C5 cells were phenotypically Thy 1.2+ and Lyt 2.1+ with rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene also being identified. D10 was Thy 1.2+ and L3T4+ with T-cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangement not detectable. Since the same sized rearranged bands were observed between C5 and L8313 leukemic mouse spleen cells, it is indicated that C5 cells are derived from the leukemic cells. Inoculation of these cells into mice induced granulocytosis. These results indicated that L8313, which was thought to be a ""granulocytic leukemia"", is actually a T-cell leukemia, whose granulocytosis is a leukemoid reaction induced by normal hemopoietic cells responding to the hemopoietic stimulating factors, GM-CSA and IL-3, produced by the leukemic T cells.

In addition to the monoclonal antibodies which recognize P-glycoprotein, we have obtained two monoclonal antibodies (designated MRK4 and MRK20) which recognize an Mr 85,000 membrane protein. Using MRK20 as a probe, we have studied the expression of the Mr 85,000 protein in various human multidrug-resistant and -sensitive cell lines. The Mr 85,000 protein was overexpressed in K562/ADM and in a human ovarian cancer cell line resistant to Adriamycin, 2780AD. The protein, if any, was not detected in other drug-resistant human cell lines such as colchicine-resistant KB cells (KB-C4), vinblastine-resistant CEM cells (CEM/VLB100), and vincristine-resistant K562 cells (K562/VCR). We have isolated subclones of K562/ADM cells which express different amounts of the Mr 85,000 protein. The expression of the Mr 85,000 protein diminished when the cells were not kept in Adriamycin, and increased when the clones were kept in the presence of Adriamycin. In contrast, the expression of P-glycoprotein remained constant whether in the presence or absence of Adriamycin during these experiments. These findings suggest that the Mr 85,000 membrane protein is closely related to the resistant mechanism specific to Adriamycin resistance, which is different from that of the pleiotropic drug resistance.","['Hamada, H', 'Okochi, E', 'Watanabe, M', 'Oh-hara, T', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Kawabata, H', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Hamada H', 'Okochi E', 'Watanabe M', 'Oh-hara T', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Kawabata H', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Dec 15;48(24 Pt 1):7082-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases (greater than 50%) in the half-life for aminoglycoside excretion were not associated with antileukemic or aminoglycoside therapy alone but occurred in 12 of 17 children when amphotericin B was added to the antimicrobial regimen. Seven children had impaired aminoglycoside clearance without increases (greater than 50%) in serum creatinine; hence the resulting adjustments in aminoglycoside dosage would not have been made had we relied solely on serial measurements of serum creatinine. Evidence for increased excretion of the renal enzymes N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alanine aminopeptidase during amphotericin B therapy suggested that damage to proximal tubular cells may contribute to the renal impairment that has been associated with this drug.

While dibutyryl 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) alone produced only a slight increase in TGase activity in HL60 cells, the concomitant addition of db-cAMP (100 microM) with RA (10(-12)-10(-4) M) potentiates RA induction of TGase activity. Maximal increases in TGase activity (2- to 10-fold) were observed with 10(-4)-10(-7) M RA and when db-cAMP was present from 24 to 48 h after the addition of RA. The cyclic nucleotide enhancement was dose-dependent from 10 to 100 microM of cAMP. Less marked increases were observed with 8-bromo-cAMP and with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline. Although the simultaneous addition of PGE1 or PGE2 (10(-8)-10(-6) M) produced no enhancement of RA-induced TGase activity, adding PGE1 or PGE2 24 or 48 h following RA treatments produced an enhancement of TGase activity. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor potentiated the increases produced by db-cAMP and the prostaglandins. Dibutyryl cAMP enhanced the ability of RA to induce the cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), a functional measure of differentiation, at lower concentrations of RA and with shorter treatment durations. cAMP potentiates RA-induced TGase activity in HL60 cells and the combination appears to be associated with enhanced RA-induced differentiation.","['Maddox, A M', 'Haddox, M K']","['Maddox AM', 'Haddox MK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical School, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Exp Cell Biol,Experimental cell biology,7701827,"['0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Transglutaminases/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*enzymology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000163462 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Biol. 1988;56(1-2):49-59. doi: 10.1159/000163462.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Moloney murine leukemia virus myc oncogene (M-MuLV (myc], carried by an amphotropic MuLV helper, induced tumors in NIH Swiss and NFS/N mice after a relatively long latency (8 to 24 wk). Tumor masses appeared in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry of the tumor cells indicated that approximately 50% were positive for Thy 1.2. Most of these tumors also expressed one or more other cell surface markers of thymocytes and mature T cells (CD4, CD8). Southern blot hybridization revealed genomic rearrangements for the TCR beta genes. The TCR beta analysis suggested that the M-MuLV(myc)-induced Thy 1.2+ tumors were derived from somewhat less mature cells than tumors induced by M-MuLV, which is a classical non-acute retrovirus lacking an oncogene. The remainder of the M-MuLV(myc)-induced tumors were Thy 1.2-, but they were positive for Ly-5 (B220) and also for MAC-2. The Thy 1.2- tumors were characteristically located in the thymus. However, they were negative for TCR beta gene rearrangements. Some, but not all, of the Thy 1.2- tumors contained rearrangements for Ig genes. Additionally, they typically expressed mRNA specific for B but not for T cells. Thus, these thymic tumors had characteristics of the B cell lineage. Tumor transplantation experiments demonstrated that the Thy 1.2- tumor cells could reestablish in the thymus and spleen of irradiated hosts, and low level expression of the Thy 1 molecule was observed in the thymus but not the spleen on the first passage.

Identification of subpopulation markers by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.,1453-61,"This study provides new knowledge on the changes in protein expression that differentiate the functionally and phenotypically different cells of the human immune system. Purification by flow cytometry of normal lymphocytes (both T and B cells), monocytes and granulocytes, combined with high-resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed reproducible qualitative and quantitative changes between these cell populations. Characteristic profiles of marker proteins for each cell type were identified. Determination of markers for T lymphocyte subpopulations was achieved by the comparative analysis of normal T cells separated on the basis of CD4 and CD8 expression in combination with the analysis of cells from patients with T cell chronic lymphocyte leukemia. These results suggest that the modulation or regulation of proteins is very strictly controlled in lymphoid differentiation, and that several quantitative and a few qualitative differences can give rise to completely different phenotypes. Thus, instead of detecting numerous random differences among lymphocyte protein patterns, rather stringent regulation of protein expression in each subpopulation was found.","['Willard-Gallo, K E', 'Houck, D W', 'Loken, M R']","['Willard-Gallo KE', 'Houck DW', 'Loken MR']","['International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/analysis/classification', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/analysis/classification', 'Cell Separation', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/analysis/cytology', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis/classification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/*analysis/classification', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis/classification']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830180923 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1988 Sep;18(9):1453-61. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830180923.,['AI 14872/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have monitored the effects of tiazofurin on human HL-60 promyelocytic cell differentiation and protooncogene expression. Tiazofurin (10 microM) induced a more differentiated HL-60 cell phenotype as determined by histochemical staining and decreased myeloperoxidase gene expression. This induction of differentiation was associated with a loss of proliferative capacity and decreases in clonogenic survival. The results also demonstrate that tiazofurin induces a down-regulation of c-myc mRNA levels. In contrast, there was no detectable change in the level of 3.8-kilobase c-myb transcripts. Furthermore, treatment of HL-60 cells with tiazofurin resulted in the appearance of an additional c-myb mRNA with an apparent size of 3.3 kilobases. The addition of guanosine to tiazofurin-treated HL-60 cells prevented the down-regulation of c-myc transcripts and also inhibited induction of the 3.3-kilobase c-myb transcript. Moreover, this additional transcript was not detected during induction of HL-60 cells by dimethyl sulfoxide, tumor necrosis factor, and retinal, but was induced by another IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, mycophenolic acid. These results suggest a role for guanosine ribonucleotides in the regulation of c-myc and c-myb gene expression during HL-60 cell differentiation. The results also suggest that changes in c-myb expression can be dissociated from that of c-myc and induction of myeloid differentiation.","['Kharbanda, S M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Spriggs, D R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Kharbanda SM', 'Sherman ML', 'Spriggs DR', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Nov 1;48(21):5965-8.,"['CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two culture systems have been used for these studies. The first supports the proliferation of fibroblast colony-forming cells (F-CFC) and the formation of confluent layers of fibroblastoid cells; the second (the long-term bone marrow culture system) results in the formation of a complex and heterogeneous layer of adherent cells composed of fibroblasts, fat cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and 'blanket' cells. A survey of the work done using these culture systems shows that, although the issue of the transplantability of stromal cells remains controversial, it now seems reasonably certain that repopulation of the fibroblast component by donor cells is rare. In contrast, one study has shown that endothelial-like cells can engraft in transplant recipients. Another study has demonstrated a donor origin for the macrophages found in long-term cultures of marrow from transplanted patients. This finding might have been predicted because macrophages are derived from haemopoietic stem cells.","['Gordon, M Y']",['Gordon MY'],"['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Extracellular Matrix', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Jul;3(4):247-51.,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,

To achieve this goal which cannot be accomplished by using the Haemonetics model 30 alone, we used the Haemonetics model 30 and a density gradient together in a two-step procedure. In the first step we obtained the buffy coat from original bone marrow grafts and in the second we reintroduced these buffy coats into the Haemonetics bowl followed by Percoll, adjusted to 1.079 g/ml, at 5 ml/min in order to recover the light density mononuclear cells. After this second step, the mean volume of the marrow and the RBC and nucleated cell contaminations were reduced to 9%, 0.96% and 16% of their original values the unseparated bone marrow, respectively. This was far better than the values obtained after the first step (volume: 19%; RBC: 10%; nucleated cells: 54%). The CFU-GM recoveries after the first and second steps were 71% and 70% of the original samples, respectively. The entire procedure lasted between 75 and 150 min. At this time, 17 of the 24 patients whose bone marrow was separated using Percoll gradient in the Haemonetics bowl have been grafted. Thirteen of these 17 patients had an evaluable haematological recovery which was complete and rapid for all but one patient with acute myeloid leukaemia. These results demonstrate that the introduction of a density gradient into the Haemonetics model 30 bowl is possible and effective. The reduction in total volume and cell number permits ex vivo purging, without decreasing the grafting capability.","['Humblet, Y', 'Lefebvre, P', 'Jacques, J L', 'Bosly, A', 'Feyens, A M', 'Sekhavat, M', 'Agaliotis, D', 'Symann, M']","['Humblet Y', 'Lefebvre P', 'Jacques JL', 'Bosly A', 'Feyens AM', 'Sekhavat M', 'Agaliotis D', 'Symann M']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['65455-52-9 (Percoll)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient/instrumentation/*methods', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Povidone', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Jan;3(1):63-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal neutrophil and platelet counts were attained by day 14 and blood counts remained normal thereafter. An overshoot in peripheral blood haemopoietic progenitor levels occurred at the end of the second week, presumably the progeny of a family of early progenitor cells. The completeness of haemopoietic reconstitution is further illustrated by the satisfactory nucleated cell and myeloid progenitor cell yield when a bone marrow harvest was performed 4 1/2 months post-graft. Seven months post-graft, the patient remained in complete remission with normal blood counts and bone marrow cellularity, although haemopoietic progenitor levels were slightly reduced. The rapid recovery minimises aplasia-related risks and suggests that such autografting can be carried out safely in first remission.

The growth of GM-CFU was stimulated by placental-conditioned medium, whereas both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leucocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM) and 'pluripoietin' from the 5637 cell line served as equally efficient stimulators of BFUe and CFU-GEM growth. Plating efficiency (e.o.p.) of GM-CFU and numbers of myeloid and mixed progenitors transplanted per kg body weight were significantly lower in those patients who died in the aplastic phase 2-6 weeks postgrafting (n = 4). These data show that low numbers of clonogenic cells, in particular GM-CFU, indicate a higher risk of death from infection following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and argue for a contribution of GM-CFU in the seeding of an aplastic bone marrow.","['Gerhartz, H H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Clemm, C', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Gerhartz HH', 'Kolb HJ', 'Clemm C', 'Wilmanns W']","['Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich University, GFR.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Postoperative Period/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1986 Dec;1(2):221-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCS2 was positive in blast cells of 78 of 88 (88.5%) and MY9 in 51 of 81 (64%) cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia in myeloid blast crisis. One or other McAb, or both, were positive in all but 2 (2.3%) of these cases. MCS2 was more sensitive than MY9 to detect blasts of the myeloid lineage due to its most frequent reactivity in the cytoplasm of fixed cells by the immunoperoxidase (IP) technique compared with its membrane expression on cell suspensions by immunofluorescence (IF). MY9 was not suitable for tests on fixed cells. MCS2 was positive by IP but not by IF in 24% of AML, but the reverse was not observed. This suggests that the antigen detected by MCS2 is expressed in myeloblasts first in the cytoplasm and later on the cell membrane, pattern which is similar to that of the early antigens CD3 and CD22 in T and B lineage lymphoblasts, respectively. MCS2 was always positive in FAB types of AML-involving myeloblasts (M1-M4), including cases of undifferentiated morphology (M0), whilst MY9 was more frequently positive in monocytic leukaemia (M5). On the other hand, MCS2 was positive in 4 of 33 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and MY9 in 1.

Rat LAK cells exhibit broad cytolytic activity against a variety of hematopoietic neoplasms, but do not kill normal bone marrow cells or lectin-stimulated blasts. Bone marrow was harvested from normal Fischer 344 rats, combined with increasing numbers of CRNK-16 tumor cells, and then incubated with LAK cells. The BM/tumor/LAK mixture was then administered to untreated Fischer rats, and the ability of the LAK cells to purge the bone marrow of neoplastic cells and prevent the transmission of the leukemia to recipient animals monitored. Our results demonstrate that LAK cells are capable of efficiently purging the bone marrow of neoplastic cells. Treatment of the BM/tumor mixtures with LAK cells is associated with significant prolongation of survival in the higher tumor doses (10(5) tumor cells/recipient) and complete elimination of the tumor in a high percentage of recipients at lower tumor levels (10(3)-10(4) tumor cells/recipient). At levels of BM transfer comparable to that used in humans, there was no evidence of a failure of LAK-treated bone marrow to reconstitute lethally conditioned recipient animals. However, with lower numbers of BM cells, there was an increased mortality in animals receiving LAK-treated BM, suggesting a minimal inhibition of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell function when suboptimal numbers of BM cells are used for reconstitution. These experiments demonstrate that LAk cells are capable of eliminating neoplastic cells in bone marrow without significant destruction of immature syngeneic stem cells. LAK cells display a broad range of cytolytic activity against hematopoietic and solid tissue tumors, and are therefore capable of eliminating small numbers of tumor cells from a wide variety of neoplastic diseases of the marrow. The ability to detect and eliminate malignant cells, without interfering with reconstitution with donor marrow, suggests that immune therapy with LAK cells can be a relatively simple and efficient method to purge bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in patients following high-dose chemotherapy for neoplastic diseases.","['Long, G S', 'Hiserodt, J C', 'Harnaha, J B', 'Cramer, D V']","['Long GS', 'Hiserodt JC', 'Harnaha JB', 'Cramer DV']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15261.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Lymphokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Rats']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198809000-00020 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1988 Sep;46(3):433-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198809000-00020.,"['CA 43765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 32580/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 37638/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We cloned the cDNA for the common beta subunit and investigated beta subunit mRNA expression in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human granulocytic cells. Leukocyte adherence receptor beta subunit mRNA transcripts were present in low levels in HL-60 myeloblasts and promyelocytes and increased 10-fold or greater with chemically induced differentiation to more mature granulocytes (using retinoic acid and dimethylformamide) or monocyte/macrophages (using phorbol myristate acetate). Levels of beta subunit mRNA expression were also increased both in normal human peripheral blood granulocytes and in granulocytes from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Nuclear run-off assays indicated that the increased steady state level of the beta subunit mRNA in retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells was secondary to enhanced beta subunit gene transcription. We conclude that mRNA levels for the beta subunit of the receptor on human leukocytes that mediates cellular adherence are increased in more mature granulocytic cells compared to immature myeloid precursors and that this enhanced mRNA expression is transcriptionally regulated.","['Hickstein, D D', 'Hickey, M J', 'Collins, S J']","['Hickstein DD', 'Hickey MJ', 'Collins SJ']","['Medical Research Division, Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/25 00:00,1988/09/25 00:01,['1988/09/25 00:00'],"['1988/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)68323-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Sep 25;263(27):13863-7.,['CA40728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the low-copy probes cross-hybridize to regions within the Tla locus in a genotype-specific manner. Although a strong association was found between TL mouse strains and TLev1, the presence or absence of the TLev1 locus did not exclusively correlate with expression or nonexpression of TL antigens. Analysis of different Mus subspecies indicates that TLev1 integrated into a common ancestor of the species Mus musculus. It is suggested that the loss of the TLev1 locus from certain mouse genomes reflects evolutionary rearrangements in the TL region; the resulting diversity may relate to the differential expression of TL antigens among mouse strains.

Tiazofurin-mediated cell differentiation is a multistep process. The inducer initiates early (less than 6 hr) metabolic changes that precede commitment to differentiation; among these early changes are decreases in IMP dehydrogenase activity and in GTP concentration, as well as alterations in the expression of certain protooncogenes (c-Ki-ras). K-562 cells do express commitment-i.e., cells exhibit differentiation without tiazofurin. Guanosine was effective in preventing the action of tiazofurin, thus providing evidence that the guanine nucleotides are critically involved in tiazofurin-initiated differentiation. Activation of transcription of the erythroid-specific gene that encodes A gamma-globin is a late (48 hr) but striking effect of tiazofurin. Down-regulation of the c-ras gene appears to be part of the complex process associated with tiazofurin-induced erythroid differentiation and relates to the perturbations of GTP metabolism.","['Olah, E', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Ikegami, T', 'Kote, Z', 'Horanyi, M', 'Szelenyi, J', 'Paulik, E', 'Kremmer, T', 'Hollan, S R', 'Sugar, J']","['Olah E', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Ikegami T', 'Kote Z', 'Horanyi M', 'Szelenyi J', 'Paulik E', 'Kremmer T', 'Hollan SR', 'Sugar J', 'et al.']","['Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, ras/*drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.17.6533 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Sep;85(17):6533-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.17.6533.,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC282007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents known to interact with the plasma membrane did not potentiate DOX activity in P388R cells unless these same agents were also capable of interacting with acidic compartments within the cell. The lysosomotropic detergent Triton WR-1339, for example, potentiated DOX activity in P388R cells and stimulated the net accumulation of daunorubicin (DAU) in P388R cells by inhibiting drug exodus. However, another detergent, deoxycholate, and two membrane active antibiotics, amphotericin B and filipin, had no effect on DOX activity and/or DAU efflux in P388R cells. Lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and secretory inhibitors such as monensin, cytochalasin B, and vinblastine all inhibited DAU efflux from P388R cells. In a MDR B16 melanoma cell line, the activity of DOX was potentiated by both verapamil and reserpine. These same two agents also inhibited melanin secretion from this same cell line. Based on these observations, we propose that secretory vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus might be involved in the MDR phenomenon. We further suggest that drugs such as DOX might be concentrated in these acidic vesicles, where they would be released to the outside of the cell by exocytosis.","['Klohs, W D', 'Steinkampf, R W']","['Klohs WD', 'Steinkampf RW']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Amines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Melanins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lysosomes/*physiology', 'Melanins/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Naphthacenes/metabolism', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Reserpine/pharmacology', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1988 Aug;34(2):180-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Others have shown that mutant CHO cells deficient in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRTase) or adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRTase) are resistant to 3-DG. We developed a L1210 cell line resistant to 3-DG, L1210/3-DG, by subculturing the parent L1210/0 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of 3-DG. The IC50 was 3.5 microM and 620 microM for L1210/0 and L1210/3-DG, respectively. Cytotoxicity studies proved the resistance to be stable. Examination of the baseline-specific activity of HGPRTase and APRTase showed that the former was 118-fold lower in L1210/3-DG than in L1210/0, and the latter demonstrated no difference. A 4-h treatment of the cell lines at IC50 doses showed 48% and 23% reductions in IMP dehydrogenase in L1210/0 and L1210/3-DG, respectively. The rate of de novo purine biosynthesis was studied by using [14C]formic acid. Formate flux increased 2-fold in L1210/3DG in concert with the observed deficiency of HGPRTase in the cell line. 3-DG uptake was studied with [14C]-labelled compound. The total radioactivity was 9-fold higher in L1210/0 than in L1210/3-DG at 2 h. Subsequent chromatographic separation of radioactivity showed the 3-DG and 3-deazaguanosine pools of the drug to be equal in both lines. However, 3-DG nucleotide pools at 1 min and 2 h were 2.5-fold and 16-fold lower, respectively, in L1210/3-DG than in L1210/0. 3-DG incorporation studies with radiolabelled drug demonstrated that 3-deazaguanine is incorporated in the acid-insoluble fraction of the cell. These studies conclude that HGPRTase, and not APRTase, is required for the activation of drug. Inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase is partially responsible for antitumor activity of the drug.

The s-IL-2R levels in the sera of the ATL patients were markedly higher (range 540-310, 400 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 62,800 +/- 81,000 U/ml, n = 42) than those in normal individuals (range 42-950 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 322 +/- 198 U/ml, n = 35, P less than 0.01). The patients with acute-type or lymphoma-type ATL had high s-IL-2R levels (range 11,900-310,400 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 110,340 +/- 370 U/ml, n = 15; range 26,400-214,400 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 90,170 +/- 59,040 U/ml, n = 7, respectively). All of the patients with hypercalcemia (Ca greater than 10 mg/dl) or elevated serum LDH levels (LDH greater than 500 IU/liter) also had s-IL-2R levels above 10,000 U/ml. The high s-IL-2R levels in the sera of ATL patients indicate abnormal IL-2 receptor production and its release from the leukemic cells in vivo. Thus, the serum s-IL-2R level may be a sensitive and useful marker to monitor the total amount of tumor cells in ATL, especially in the lymphoma type. We next examined the serum s-IL-2R levels in human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type-I (HTLV-I) seropositive healthy carriers to investigate whether there might be abnormal IL-2 receptor expression in such individuals. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the s-IL-2R level of 71 HTLV-I seropositive healthy carriers (range 65-880 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 394 +/- 212 U/ml) and that of 71 age- and sex-matched normal individuals (range 33-950 U/ml, mean +/- SD = 357 +/- 224 U/ml) who lived in Okinawa Prefecture.","['Motoi, T', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Uchino, H', 'Ueda, R', 'Araki, K']","['Motoi T', 'Uchiyama T', 'Uchino H', 'Ueda R', 'Araki K']","['First Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calcium/blood', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1988.tb00028.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1988 May;79(5):593-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1988.tb00028.x.,,PMC5917554,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human thymus cells and the HD-MAR T-cell line were also found to be capable of forming rosettes with MRBC. The binding of MRBC by thymocytes differed from that of sheep (SRBC), rabbit (RRBC) and human (HRBC) erythrocytes by a number of parameters: monoclonal antibodies against the E-receptor inhibited the attachment of SRBC, RRBC, and HRBC, but not of MRBC to thymus cells. The presence of EDTA had the opposite effect, abrogating only the attachment of MRBC to thymus cells but not of RBC from the other sources. Exposure of thymus cells to pronase eliminated their capacity to bind SRBC, RRBC, and HRBC, but only slightly inhibited the attachment of MRBC. Treatment with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase enhanced the formation of rosettes with SRBC, RRBC, and HRBC, but had no effect on the formation of rosettes with MRBC. Exposure of thymus cells and of the HD-MAR cells to phospholipase C enhanced the proportion of rosettes formed with MRBC, but had no effect on the binding of other RBC. Treatment with either phospholipase A2 or phospholipase D had no such effect. The binding of MRBC by Raji cells was not increased by phospholipase C treatment. The present study indicates that the binding of MRBC by human thymus cells is mediated by receptors distinct from those involved in the binding of SRBC, RRBC, and HRBC and also from those mediating the binding of MRBC to human B-cells.","['Levy, J', 'Rabinowitz, R', 'Schlesinger, M']","['Levy J', 'Rabinowitz R', 'Schlesinger M']","['Hubert H.

Southern blotting and in situ chromosomal hybridization studies in one patient with the t(7;11) demonstrated that both alleles of the T-cell antigen receptor beta-subunit gene (TCRB) were rearranged, and that one TCRB allele had relocated from 7q35 to the fusion point in band p13 of the involved chromosome 11 (11p-). These findings suggest that juxtaposition of TCRB with the putative oncogene tcl-2 located in band 11p13 may be a critical step toward development of this T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In the other two translocations, all breakpoints were sites for lymphocyte function genes, ie, 7q35 for TCRB, 14q11 for T-cell antigen receptor alpha-subunit gene (TCRA), 7p15 for T-cell antigen receptor alpha-subunit gene (TCRG), and 14q32 for immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGH). Thus, the findings in these cases allow us to expand the above hypothesis and propose that the juxtaposition of TCRB or TCRG with tcl-2, TCRA, or IGH through chromosomal translocation may activate a mechanism for the genesis of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with these chromosome translocations.","['Kaneko, Y', 'Maseki, N', 'Homma, C', 'Sakurai, M', 'Mizutani, S', 'Takeda, T', 'Shikano, T', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Yaoi, K', 'Shimokawa, T']","['Kaneko Y', 'Maseki N', 'Homma C', 'Sakurai M', 'Mizutani S', 'Takeda T', 'Shikano T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Yaoi K', 'Shimokawa T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Saitama Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81028-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):534-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize these anti-idiotopes further, they were used to immunize mice and rabbits. Several murine anti-anti-Idiotype mAb (Ab3), mostly of IgM-k isotype, were obtained. mAb3 and sera from rabbits immunized with Ab2 contained antibodies that bind to gp37 Ag and leukemic MOLT-4 and JM cells. Also, mAb3 and immune sera from rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to MOLT-4 cells. They inhibited the binding of iodinated Ab1 to Ab2 indicating that Ab3 in mice and rabbits shares idiotopes with Ab1 (SN2). Furthermore, both the murine mAb3 and rabbit polyclonal Ab3 immunoprecipitated the same gp37 Ag as SN2 (Ab1). The production of Ag-specific Ab3 (Ab1') in mice and rabbits in absence of any exposure to gp37 indicates that these Ab2 may indeed carry the internal image of the gp37 Ag. Such anti-idiotopes (Ab2 beta) may be useful as Ag substitute for the induction of therapeutic immunity in T cell leukemia patients.","['Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, M', 'Chatterjee, S K', 'Vasile, S', 'Seon, B K', 'Kohler, H']","['Bhattacharya-Chatterjee M', 'Chatterjee SK', 'Vasile S', 'Seon BK', 'Kohler H']","['Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precipitin Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Aug 15;141(4):1398-403.,['CA 41636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to understand the relationship between HTLV-I infection and malignant transformation, we have examined transferrin receptor expression in HTLV-I-infected cells. Transferrin receptor expression in normal T cells is tightly regulated and essential for cell proliferation. We have used matched T cell sets originating from a normal donor, consisting of tetanus toxoid-specific normal T cell clones (TM3 and TM5) and their in vitro HTLV-I-infected counterparts (TM3H and TM5H). Using these matched sets of virus-infected and normal T cells, we have determined that HTLV-I infection leads to hyperexpression of surface transferrin receptors (five- to six-fold higher than normal counterparts). Although the growth rates of the virus-infected cells did not differ significantly from their normal controls, HTLV-I-infected cells constitutively hyperexpressed surface transferrin receptors, whereas the level of surface receptor expression of normal counterpart cells varied during the cycle of antigenic stimulation. Immunoprecipitation of total (surface plus cytoplasmic) transferrin expression showed that the HTLV-I-infected cells did not possess a greater total number of transferrin receptors than their normal counterparts. This data was supported by Northern blot analysis, which showed equivalent transferrin receptor mRNA expression in HTLV-I-infected and uninfected cells. Functional analysis revealed a marked defect in 59Fe-transferrin internalization in the HTLV-I-infected cells. Furthermore, the HTLV-I-infected cells showed markedly decreased transferrin receptor phosphorylation and internalization in response to active phorbol ester. Thus the data demonstrate that in peripheral blood T cells, HTLV-I infection is accompanied by surface transferrin receptor overexpression secondary to subcellular redistribution and defective internalization.","['Vidal, C', 'Matsushita, S', 'Colamonici, O R', 'Trepel, J B', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Neckers, L M']","['Vidal C', 'Matsushita S', 'Colamonici OR', 'Trepel JB', 'Mitsuya H', 'Neckers LM']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus/*physiology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/etiology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Aug 1;141(3):984-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, we measured the level of soluble Tac peptide, one chain of the human interleukin-2 receptor, in the serum of 50 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (38 Japanese and 12 American patients), 8 patients with other hematologic malignancies, 8 asymptomatic HTLV-I-antibody-positive carriers, and 17 normal controls. The serum level of soluble Tac peptide (geometric mean U/mL, 95% CI) was elevated at presentation in all patients with adult T-cell leukemia (16,461; 819 to 330,896) when compared with normal controls (238; 112 to 502), patients with other hematologic malignancies (1302; 475 to 3569), and healthy HTLV-I antibody-positive carriers (490; 115 to 2086). The highest levels were seen in patients (n = 33) with acute (32,154; 2587 to 399,598) compared with chronic (5464; 661 to 45,156) disease (n = 14). Serum levels of Tac peptide also tended to be more elevated in patients with adult T-cell leukemia with hypercalcemia (32,072; 2461 to 417,908) compared with normocalcemic patients (13,885; 496 to 388,436). Serial measurements of soluble Tac peptide levels in serum were done in four patients with adult T-cell leukemia during chemotherapy and the levels reflected disease activity. These observations suggest that the measurement of soluble Tac peptide levels in patients with adult T-cell leukemia is useful as a noninvasive measure of tumor burden and will help in the diagnosis of the disease and management of these patients.","['Marcon, L', 'Rubin, L A', 'Kurman, C C', 'Fritz, M E', 'Longo, D L', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Edwards, B K', 'Nelson, D L']","['Marcon L', 'Rubin LA', 'Kurman CC', 'Fritz ME', 'Longo DL', 'Uchiyama T', 'Edwards BK', 'Nelson DL']","['National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*blood/drug therapy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-109-4-274 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1988 Aug 15;109(4):274-9. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-109-4-274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic studies of the J774.2 parental and two colchicine-resistant (CLCR) sublines--J7.Cl-30 (770-fold CLCR) and J7.Cl-100 (2500-fold CLCR)--demonstrated specific numeric and structural karyotypic alterations accompanying the emergence of mdr. The parental cells demonstrated a modal chromosome number of 63, while the modal number of the J7.Cl-30 subline was 53. The most striking difference between the parental and J7.Cl-30 subline was the presence of an average of 60 double minutes (DMs) per cell in the CLCR cells. The 2500-fold resistant J7.Cl-100 subline displayed a modal number of 50, which included structural rearrangements involving chromosomes 2 and 7 and concomitant replacement of DMs by a homogeneously staining region (HSR). Southern blotting analysis demonstrated a approximately 35-fold amplification of P-glycoprotein homologous sequences in the J7.Cl-30 subline and approximately 70-fold amplification in the J7.Cl-100 subline. Chromosomal in situ hybridization localized the amplified P-glycoprotein sequences to DMs (J7.Cl-30) and the HSR (J7.Cl-100) in these CLCR sublines.

The effects of chronic infection on the specific functional activities and growth requirements of mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have remained poorly defined. We have, therefore, investigated the results of HTLV-I infection of both CD4+ and CD8+ human CTL clones. HTLV-I infection resulted in the establishment of functional CTL lines which propagated indefinitely in culture many months longer than the uninfected parental clone. The infected cells became independent of the need for antigen (target cell) stimulation as a requirement for proliferation and growth. Like their uninfected counterparts, however, these HTLV-I-infected clones remained strictly dependent on conditioned medium from mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes for their growth. This growth factor requirement was not fulfilled by recombinant interleukin-2 alone. Furthermore, the infected lines remained functionally identical to their uninfected parental CTL clones in their ability to specifically recognize and lyse the appropriate target cells. Our findings indicate that the major effects of HTLV-I infection on mature CTL consist of (i) the capacity for proliferation in the absence of antigen stimulation and (ii) a prolonged or immortal survival in vitro, but they also indicate that the fine specificity and cytolytic capacity of these cells remain unaffected.","['Faller, D V', 'Crimmins, M A', 'Mentzer, S J']","['Faller DV', 'Crimmins MA', 'Mentzer SJ']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-D Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/*microbiology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.62.8.2942-2950.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Aug;62(8):2942-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.8.2942-2950.1988.,['CA37169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC253732,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a multiple logistic regression analysis, only three factors, leukemic manifestation, poor performance status (PS), and a high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, were significantly associated with the poor response rate. In a Cox proportional hazards model analysis, shortened survival was again significantly associated with poor PS and a high LDH level, but not with a clinical diagnosis of ATL. The two factors, PS and LDH level, that were found to be significantly associated with both CR and survival rates, were used to construct a model containing six categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival. These categories divided the patients into three groups with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 75% and 53% for low-risk, 45% and 15% for moderate-risk, and 15% and 0% for high-risk. The results indicate that PS and LDH levels were the most important in predicting the response and survival of an adult patient with advanced T-cell lymphoma/leukemia.

Studies of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and reductase and isoprenoid labeling in cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation.,10104-10,"The activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and reductase were assayed in exponentially growing LM fibroblasts and Friend murine erythroleukemia cells isolated at various stages of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation. The activities of these enzymes were similar in all phases of the cell cycle, regardless of whether the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of serum. These observations were confirmed in murine erythroleukemia cells synchronized by recultivation of pure populations of G1 cells. The incorporation of [14C]acetate or 3H2O into sterols decreased by 30-50% in later stages of the cell cycle, whereas the incorporation of [14C]acetate into ubiquinone increased as the cells progressed toward mitosis. Similar changes in the labeling of sterols compared to ubiquinone and dolichol were observed when [3H]mevalonate was used, suggesting that cell cycle-dependent alterations may occur in the flux of farnesyl pyrophosphate into the various branches of the isoprenoid pathway. Synchronized murine erythroleukemia cells incorporated [3H]mevalonate into protein-bound isoprenyl groups at all stages of the cell cycle, and there were no substantial changes in the electrophoretic profiles of these labeled polypeptides. The finding that the activities of the enzymes regulating mevalonate synthesis did not vary substantially during the cell cycle implies that changes in the endogenous mevalonate pool probably do not play a limiting role in regulating cell cycle traverse when cells are undergoing exponential growth. Although small cell cycle-dependent changes may occur in the relative activity of various post-mevalonate branches of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, there is no evidence that synthesis of any major isoprenoid end product is confined exclusively to a specific phase of the cell cycle.","['Maltese, W A', 'Sheridan, K M']","['Maltese WA', 'Sheridan KM']","['Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Glycolipids)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.3.3.10 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase)', 'EC 4.1.3.- (Oxo-Acid-Lyases)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Centrifugation/methods', 'Glycolipids/*biosynthesis', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/*metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Mevalonic Acid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxo-Acid-Lyases/*metabolism']",1988/07/25 00:00,1988/07/25 00:01,['1988/07/25 00:00'],"['1988/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)81483-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Jul 25;263(21):10104-10.,['R01 CA 34569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current large-scale serosurvey was undertaken to improve our understanding of HTLV-I prevalence in different parts of the world. We analyzed 43,445 serum samples collected from various geographic locales worldwide; 76% of these sera came from clinically healthy donors. Samples were initially screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 4,353 were further evaluated by means of competition assays. In this study, which did not include sera from endemic areas of Japan, a high prevalence of infection was observed in several countries in the Caribbean basin. A significant age-sex difference was observed between populations in the Caribbean and non-endemic regions of Japan. The reason for the male excess in non-endemic areas of Japan will require further study, while the female excess in the Caribbean basin is compatible with the previously described pattern for other HTLV-I-endemic areas. A newly recognized area of possible endemicity was southern Florida, where evidence of infection with HTLV-I or a related virus was found in a group of native Americans whose sera were collected in 1968. In certain parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, important problems in determining specificity of reactivity occurred, probably because of cross-reacting antibodies. No pattern was detected that could explain the cross-reactivity solely on the basis of geographic areas, specific patterns of non-viral parasitic infection, or methods of handling the specimens. It is possible that these cross-reactivities are antibodies to proteins from HTLV-I-related retroviruses yet to be discovered.","['Levine, P H', 'Blattner, W A', 'Clark, J', 'Tarone, R', 'Maloney, E M', 'Murphy, E M', 'Gallo, R C', 'Robert-Guroff, M', 'Saxinger, W C']","['Levine PH', 'Blattner WA', 'Clark J', 'Tarone R', 'Maloney EM', 'Murphy EM', 'Gallo RC', 'Robert-Guroff M', 'Saxinger WC']","['Environmental Epidemiology Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Africa', 'Aged', 'Cross Reactions', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Florida', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'West Indies']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420103 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Jul 15;42(1):7-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420103.,"['1-CP-21007-00/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-CP-61003/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells express P-gp as a doublet that is photoaffinity labeled by the analog of VLB, N(p-azido-[3-125I]salicyl)-N'-beta-aminoethylvindesine ([125I]NASV). Both reserpine and, to a lesser extent, verapamil, compete with [125I]NASV for binding to P-gp. We also found that chloroquine, quinacrine, vindoline, and catharanthine, each of which enhanced VLB cytotoxicity in CEM/VLB1K cells by 10- to 15-fold, similarly inhibited [125I]NASV labeling of P-gp. However, neither quinine nor yohimbine inhibited this labeling, and the inhibition produced by catharanthine and vindoline was the greatest or exclusively on the lower band of the P-gp doublet. Our results suggest a complex relationship between the ability of a compound to modulate MDR and its ability to compete for binding to P-gp.","['Beck, W T', 'Cirtain, M C', 'Glover, C J', 'Felsted, R L', 'Safa, A R']","['Beck WT', 'Cirtain MC', 'Glover CJ', 'Felsted RL', 'Safa AR']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', ""102976-56-7 (N-(4-azido-3-iodosalicyl)-N'-beta-aminoethylvindesine)"", '2Y49VWD90Q (Yohimbine)', '571PJ1LW03 (vindoline)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'WT0YJV846J (catharanthine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Affinity Labels/*metabolism', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Azides/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Quinine/pharmacology', 'Reserpine/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Vindesine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Yohimbine/pharmacology']",1988/06/30 00:00,1988/06/30 00:01,['1988/06/30 00:00'],"['1988/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(88)81321-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(88)81321-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1988 Jun 30;153(3):959-66. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(88)81321-4.,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the presentation of a patient who was infected with the virus, we undertook a study of his family members and sexual contacts to see if a cluster of infected persons could be identified. CASE REPORT: A black heterosexual North Carolina native with a history of drug abuse presented with jaundice, and pancytopenia subsequently developed. He then became hypercalcemic and leukemic, with high numbers of circulating, morphologically abnormal CD4+ lymphocytes. RESULTS: As determined by radioimmunoassay and immunoblot analyses, the serum of the index case contained antibodies against core proteins (p19 and p24) of HTLV-I. When cultured in vitro with interleukin-2, the lymphocytes expressed HTLV-I specific core proteins. The virus recovered from these T cells was transmitted to cord blood T cells, which became immortalized for continuous growth in vitro, expressed HTLV-I p19 protein, and displayed characteristic C-type particles by electron microscopy. Studies of family members and sexual contacts, all of whom were black, heterosexual central North Carolina natives, revealed five of 28 whose serum had anti-HTLV-I antibodies as determined by radioimmunoassay and immunoblot. Neither the patient nor the seropositive family/contacts had antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus proteins. Four of the six people with HTLV-I infection had no history of intravenous drug abuse.

Replacement of the glutamate moiety in methotrexate and aminopterin by long-chain 2-aminoalkanedioic acids.,1338-44,"Eight previously unreported methotrexate (MTX) and aminopterin (AMT) analogues with the L-glutamate moiety replaced by DL-2-aminoalkanedioic acids containing up to 10 CH2 groups were synthesized from 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic or 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroic acid. All the compounds were potent inhibitors of purified L1210 mouse leukemia dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), with IC50's of 0.023-0.034 microM for the MTX analogues and 0.054-0.067 microM for the AMT analogues. The compounds were not substrates for, but were inhibitors of, partially purified mouse liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Activity was correlated with the number of CH2 groups in the side chain. The IC50's for inhibition of cell growth in culture by the chain-extended MTX analogues were 0.016-0.64 microM against CEM human leukemic lymphoblasts and 0.0012-0.026 microM against L1210 mouse leukemia cells. However, the optimal chain length for growth-inhibitory activity was species-dependent. Our results suggested that CEM cells were inhibited most actively by the analogue with nine CH2 groups, while L1210 cells were most sensitive to the analogue with six CH2 groups. Among the AMT analogues, on the other hand, the most active compound against L1210 cells was the one with nine CH2 groups, which had an IC50 of 0.000 65 microM as compared with 0.0046 microM for MTX and 0.002 microM for AMT. A high degree of cross-resistance was observed between MTX and the chain-extended compounds in two MTX-resistant cell lines, CEM/MTX and L1210/R81. All the MTX analogues were active against L1210 leukemia in mice on a qd X 9 schedule, with optimal increases in lifespan (ILS) of 75-140%. Notwithstanding their high in vitro activity, the AMT analogues were more toxic and less therapeutically effective than MTX analogues of the same chain length even though neither series of compounds possessed FPGS substrate activity. These MTX and AMT analogues are an unusual group of compounds in that they retain the dicarboxylic acid structure of classical antifolates yet are more lipophilic than the parent compounds because they have more CH2 groups and are almost equivalent in vivo to MTX on the same schedule even though they do not form polyglutamates.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Bader, H', 'Kohler, W', 'Freisheim, J H', 'Moran, R G']","['Rosowsky A', 'Bader H', 'Kohler W', 'Freisheim JH', 'Moran RG']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Amino Acids, Dicarboxylic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acids, Dicarboxylic/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', '*Glutamates', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00402a014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Jul;31(7):1338-44. doi: 10.1021/jm00402a014.,"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['J Med Chem 1988 Nov;31(11):2227'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to develop an in vitro assay to predict tumor sensitivity to taxol, human leukemic cell lines were exposed to clinically achievable concentrations of taxol for relevant exposure periods. Changes in microtubules visualized by indirect immunofluorescence were compared to drug sensitivity measured by a clonogenic assay. Taxol produced either multiple mitotic asters in G2/M or microtubule bundling throughout the cell cycle. In cells that were relatively resistant to taxol, microtubule bundling was reversible while microtubule bundling in relatively sensitive cells persisted in the presence or absence of taxol. In contrast, aster formation was unrelated to cytotoxicity in any cell line. In the future, these microtubule effects may be useful in predicting the chemotherapeutic efficacy of taxol.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Donehower, R C', 'Jones, R J', 'Tucker, R W']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Donehower RC', 'Jones RJ', 'Tucker RW']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):4093-100.,"['2-P30-CA06973-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM-57738/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA samples from 92 patients with solid tumors (lung cancer, 37; breast cancer, 24; head and neck cancer, 17; other tumors, 14) were analyzed and compared with those from 22 leukemia patients and 14 individuals without malignant neoplasms. When DNA samples were digested with HindIII restriction endonuclease, Southern blot analysis demonstrated 3 distinct polymorphic bands (9.8, 11, and 12 kilobases) after hybridization to the HER-A64-1 probe and another 2 distinct polymorphic bands (4.9 and 5.2 kilobases) after hybridization to the HER-A64-3 probe. Pedigree analysis of 43 members of a single family and comparative analysis of tumor and normal DNA samples from the same patients demonstrated that the variations in fragment size observed were due to 2 independent restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the region of the EGF receptor gene. Amplification of the EGF receptor gene was detected in 3 cases of breast cancer, but not in other tumors studied.

These phosphorylated proteins are either absent or present in very low levels in membranes of drug-sensitive cells. Growth of the vincristine-resistant isolate in the absence of drug results in a decrease in the level of resistance and a major reduction in the phosphorylation of P210 and P180. The phosphorylation of P150 is not altered in the revertant which still exhibits substantial levels of resistance. Further studies show that P210 and P180 are highly reactive with a monoclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein. These two proteins are present in only very low levels in revertant cells. The monoclonal antibody exhibits no reactivity with P150. In HL60 cells isolated for a 25-fold increase in vincristine resistance proteins reactive with P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody are essentially absent. P150 is however highly phosphorylated in these cells. Additional experiments using lectin binding of 32P-labeled proteins demonstrates that P150 has properties distinct from P210 and P180. Analysis of drug uptake patterns in the vincristine-resistant isolates and the revertant shows that resistance is related to a reduced intracellular accumulation of drug. Reduced accumulation of vincristine is also found in HL60 cells isolated for resistance to Adriamycin. These cells are devoid of P-glycoprotein but contain phosphorylated P150. These results suggest that proteins P150, P180, and P210 may contribute to multidrug resistance in HL60 cells through a mechanism which involves reduced cellular accumulation of drug. P180 and P210 are structurally related whereas P150 is distinct from these two proteins.","['McGrath, T', 'Center, M S']","['McGrath T', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):3959-63.,['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dominant role of the stage of the disease in all three diagnostic categories--acute myeloblastic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia--for all three end-points clearly indicates that resistance of the leukaemia cell to the procedure is more important than bulk of the disease. Additional prognostic factors for leukaemia-free survival and transplant-related mortality were age of the patient, cyclosporin for preventing graft-versus-host disease, and the donor-recipient sex combination. The risk of relapse was highest in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In a multivariate analysis leukaemia-free survival was similar for all three major diagnostic categories and has not changed since the introduction of the European registry in 1979.

A time course of ADR-induced DNA double-strand breaks revealed that in sensitive P388/4 cells, evidence of DNA repair was noted 4 h after removal of drug, whereas in resistant clone 3 and 7 cells repair was observed 1 h after drug removal. The earlier onset of DNA repair was statistically significant (p = 0.0154 for clone 3 cells, and p = 0.0009 for clone 7 cells). By contrast, once the repair process was initiated, the rate of repair was similar for all three cell lines. The level of glutathione transferase activity was determined in whole cell extracts. Enzyme activity (mean +/- SE) in sensitive cells was 9.49 +/- 1.00 nmol/min/mg protein, that in resistant clone 3 cells was 13.36 +/- 1.03 nmol/min/mg, and that in clone 7 cells was 13.96 +/- 1.44 nmol/min/mg; the 1.44-fold increase in enzyme activity in resistant cells was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Further evidence of induction of glutathione transferase was provided by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled cDNA for an anionic glutathione transferase, which demonstrated approximately a twofold increase in mRNA in resistant clone 7 cells. Western blot analysis with a polyvalent antibody against anionic glutathione transferase also revealed a proportionate increase in gene product in resistant cells. Dose-survival studies showed that ADR-resistant cells were cross-resistant to actinomycin D, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, colchicine, and etoposide, but not to the alkylating agent melphalan; this finding provided evidence that these cells are multidrug resistant. Using a cDNA probe for P-glycoprotein, a phenotypic marker for multidrug resistance, Northern blot analysis showed an increase in the steady state level of mRNA of approximately twofold in resistant clone 3 and 7 cells. Southern analysis with the same cDNA probe showed no evidence of gene amplification or rearrangement. Western blot analysis with monoclonal C219 antibody demonstrated a distinct increase in P-glycoprotein in resistant cells.

There are at least two forms of the cellular receptors for IL-2, one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. We have identified two IL-2 binding peptides, a 55-kd peptide reactive with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody and a 75-kd non-Tac IL-2 binding peptide. Cell lines bearing either the p55, Tac, or the p75 peptide alone manifested low-affinity IL-2 binding, whereas cell lines bearing both peptides manifested both high- and low-affinity receptors. Fusion of cell membranes from low-affinity IL-2 binding cells bearing the Tac peptide alone with membranes from a cell line bearing the p75 peptide alone generated hybrid membranes bearing high-affinity receptors. We propose a multichain model for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor in which both the p55 Tac and the p75 IL-2 binding peptides are associated in a receptor complex. The p75 peptide is the receptor for IL-2 on large granular lymphocytes and is sufficient for the IL-2 activation of these cells. In contrast to resting T cells, human T-cell lymphotropic virus I-associated adult T-cell leukemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 receptors. Because IL-2 receptors are present on the malignant T cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia are being treated with either unmodified or toxin-conjugated forms of anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor.","['Waldmann, T A', 'Tsudo, M']","['Waldmann TA', 'Tsudo M']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Exotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Pseudomonas/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1988;262:283-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 25% of the ALV-induced leukemic samples we have analyzed, acute retroviruses that have captured the activated erbB oncogene were released. The unusually high frequency at which erbB transduction occurs makes this an ideal system for studying the mechanism of oncogene transduction. In addition, these leukemic samples provide a rich source for the isolation of novel erbB-transducing viruses. We report here our characterization of several new erbB-transducing proviruses. The 5' recombination points of all these viruses mapped to the same intron in which proviral insertions cluster, supporting the hypothesis that transduction begins with proviral insertion near the oncogene. The 3' recombination points usually occurred within the 3' untranslated region downstream from the termination codon of the c-erbB gene. Three of the erbB-containing proviruses were molecularly cloned and analyzed in detail.

Despite the expression of IL-2R bearing Tac antigen (IL-2R/p55), leukemic cells of the majority of ATL patients do not proliferate in response to IL-2. In the human NK cell line, YT, as well as in ATL-derived T cells, the co-expression of IL-2R/p55 and the second IL-2R without the Tac epitope (IL-2R/p70) is required to produce high-affinity IL-2R. To study the effect of HTLV-I on both of the IL-2Rs, we transfected a fragment of HTLV-I containing the p40X gene into YT cells. One of the 2 transfected YT clones (YT/pX-5.1) had an increased level of expression of IL-2R/p55. In contrast, expression of IL-2R/p70 was unaffected, as determined by Scatchard analysis and the cross-linking study using 125I-IL-2. Our results show that the T-cell phenotype is not required for induction of IL-2R/p55 by p40X. We suggest that HTLV-I infection induces a disproportionate induction of IL-2R/p55 without significant enhancement of IL-2R/p70 expression, resulting in the predominant expression of low-affinity IL-2R in ATL. IL-2R/p70 may be a critical parameter determining the IL-2 reactivity of HTLV-I-infected T cells as well as of normal lymphocytes.","['Sabe, H', 'Tanaka, A', 'Siomi, H', 'Koyasu, S', 'Yonehara, S', 'Yahara, I', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Sugie, K', 'Teshigawara, K', 'Yodoi, J']","['Sabe H', 'Tanaka A', 'Siomi H', 'Koyasu S', 'Yonehara S', 'Yahara I', 'Tagaya Y', 'Sugie K', 'Teshigawara K', 'Yodoi J', 'et al.']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'CD2 Antigens', '*DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', '*Transfection']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910410619 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Jun 15;41(6):880-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910410619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of the higher dose of CsA from day 0 or day 14 significantly delayed the appearance of leukaemic cells in the peripheral circulation, whereas treatment with 12.5 mg/kg was without significant effect. CsA whole blood levels on day 17 were twice as high in leukaemic rats as in normal controls. Leukaemic infiltration of the spleen and the liver was reduced on day 17 after 25 mg/kg CsA, but no such effect was observed in lymph nodes or kidneys. A heterogeneous, host ""reactive"" cell population, which developed in response to the leukaemia, was inhibited by CsA, indicating that the effect of the drug was probably not mediated by host defence mechanisms.

The patient suffering from chronic neurologic disorder was found to contain antibodies to HTLV-I envelope and gag proteins in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Lymphocytes from peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of the patient were shown to express viral RNA sequences by in situ hybridization. Southern blot analysis of the patient lymphocyte DNA revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences. Blot-hybridization analysis of the RNA from fresh peripheral lymphocytes stimulated with interleukin 2 revealed the presence of abundant amounts of genomic viral RNA with little or no subgenomic RNA. We have cloned the proviral genome from the DNA of the peripheral lymphocytes and determined its restriction map.

Previously, the activity of bacterial DNA-binding proteins was found to be enhanced in potassium-containing solutions in which the anion glutamate (Glu) was substituted for chloride. We have extended this observation to include eukaryotic topoisomerase I and II activities. The concentration ranges over which DNA strand passing activities of these enzymes were observed was broader in KGlu than in KCl. This was also true for the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA strand passage and antineoplastic drug-dependent DNA cleavage produced by nuclear extracts from HL-60 human leukemia cells. The rate of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA strand passage was also dependent on anion moiety and concentration in potassium-containing buffers. Drug-dependent topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage in intact HL-60 cell nuclei was also anion-dependent, suggesting that anion type and concentration may influence topoisomerase II-mediated events in mammalian cells as had been described for other DNA binding proteins in prokaryotic systems.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of these azurophilic granules, as assessed by cytochemical staining, is unusually intense. In addition, M3 is universally associated with a chromosomal translocation, t(15;17)(q22;q11.2). In this report, the MPO gene was localized to human chromosome 17 (q12-q21), the region of the breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the t(15;17), by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ chromosomal hybridization. By means of MPO complementary DNA clones for in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, the effect of this specific translocation on the MPO gene was examined. In all cases of M3 examined, MPO is translocated to chromosome 15. Genomic blot analyses indicate rearrangement of MPO in leukemia cells of two of four cases examined. These findings suggest that MPO may be pivotal in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Weil, S C', 'Rosner, G L', 'Reid, M S', 'Chisholm, R L', 'Lemons, R S', 'Swanson, M S', 'Carrino, J J', 'Diaz, M O', 'Le Beau, M M']","['Weil SC', 'Rosner GL', 'Reid MS', 'Chisholm RL', 'Lemons RS', 'Swanson MS', 'Carrino JJ', 'Diaz MO', 'Le Beau MM']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/analysis', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/05/06 00:00,1988/05/06 00:01,['1988/05/06 00:00'],"['1988/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2896388 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1988 May 6;240(4853):790-2. doi: 10.1126/science.2896388.,"['1R01 CA44475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten of 13 patients from tropical countries and 2 of 8 from the United States had serum antibodies to HTLV-I. The virus was detected in cultures of peripheral-blood lymphocytes from three of seven patients by means of Southern blot hybridization. Using a sensitive in vitro enzymatic gene-amplification technique, we detected HTLV-I sequences in fresh peripheral-blood mononuclear cells of all of 11 patients tested who were positive for the antibody, and in cell cultures of the spinal fluid from 3 of the 11 tested. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cranium revealed periventricular lesions in the white matter of 3 of the 12 antibody-positive patients.

Previous studies have shown that both agents strongly inhibit protein synthesis in vivo by greater than 70% after 3 d of administration and in vitro by 50% at a 100 microM concentration of drug. This inhibition of protein synthesis of P-388 cells may be partially responsible for the cytotoxicity of the drug. These agents also inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, with DNA synthesis being suppressed by greater than 90% after 2 d of administration of drugs at the therapeutic dose. Of the sulfhydryl-bearing enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis that were assayed, only the activities of inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase and the ribonucleotide reductase complex were inhibited by greater than 50% by these sulfhydryl-reactive drugs, which would account for the observed inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis in the P-388 cells. The inhibition of the activities of these enzymes lowered the deoxyribonucleotide levels in P-388 cells, which would explain the overall suppression of DNA synthesis by the sesquiterpene lactones.","['Williams, W L Jr', 'Hall, I H', 'Grippo, A A', 'Oswald, C B', 'Lee, K H', 'Holbrook, D J', 'Chaney, S G']","['Williams WL Jr', 'Hall IH', 'Grippo AA', 'Oswald CB', 'Lee KH', 'Holbrook DJ', 'Chaney SG']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27514.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane)', '0 (Terpenes)', '4GUY9L896T (helenalin)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '68322-91-8 (bis(helenalinyl)malonate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Sesquiterpenes/*therapeutic use', 'Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane', 'Terpenes/*therapeutic use', 'Thioredoxins/antagonists & inhibitors']",1988/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3549(15)47620-8 [pii]', '10.1002/jps.2600770217 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 1988 Feb;77(2):178-84. doi: 10.1002/jps.2600770217.,"['CA17625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recognition of these tumors as distinct biologic entities dates back to the early 1970s, when patients with these diseases were found to have tumor cells that formed spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. In the last decade, however, the growth of new technologies and availability of new reagents has enabled us to characterize this group of diseases with more precision. When studied with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, there is tremendous phenotypic diversity in the types of T-cell leukemias that are encountered. In spite of this diversity, a few general facts have become apparent. To a first approximation, thymic T-cell malignancies can be related to stages of normal T-cell development. Surprisingly, in spite of the overall similarity between T-ALL and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, the antigenic phenotypes encountered suggest a biologic difference between these two diseases. Although there is not currently any single reagent that permits recognition of T-ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma in all cases, a combination of technologic approaches using conventional morphology and histochemistry, immunologic studies, and, in some cases, newer genetic studies should permit great precision in the definition of this disease. The clinical picture of T-cell ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma has traditionally been one of a poor prognosis disease with high WBC count, bulky adenopathy, and mediastinal mass. Although encountering this clinical presentation should suggest the T-cell phenotype, not all patients with T-cell leukemia will fit this stereotype. Clinical studies have also served to provide support for the expanding biologic definition of T-cell neoplasia, particularly insofar as it has been demonstrated that patients with T antigen-positive but E rosette-negative ALL behave like other patients with T-cell disease. In short, patients with thymic T-cell malignancies not only have distinctive biologic characteristics to their blasts, but also have a distinctive pattern of clinical presentation, response to therapy, and sites of relapse. These differences have prompted the search for specific therapies and also directed approaches to understanding the variable clinical outcome of patients with these malignancies.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Falletta, J M']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Falletta JM']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lab Med,Clinics in laboratory medicine,8100174,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/immunology', '*Lymphoma/classification/immunology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab Med. 1988 Mar;8(1):119-34.,,,,,,,74,,,,,,,,

A clinicopathologic study of HTLV-1-positive and HTLV-1-negative cases.,2060-70,"Postthymic T-cell malignancy shows marked geographic, clinicopathologic, and prognostic diversity. The frequency and spectrum of T-cell malignancies in Taiwan were investigated. Fifty-two patients (35 male and 17 female) with a median age of 49 years, were consecutively encountered between October 1983 and April 1987; these accounted for 39% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases seen in our institutions. Ten patients (19.3%) had adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) associated with human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1). Patients with ATL had disease similar to that reported from southwestern Japan and the Caribbean. They had frequent skin lesions (60%), hypercalcemia (40%), and a rapid clinical course with a median survival of 1.3 years. The 35 HTLV-1-negative peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTL) were similar to PTL in western countries, manifesting frequent visceral, cutaneous, and vascular tropisms. Marrow involvement was documented at presentation in 39% and Stage III/IV disease in 80% of the PTL patients. The histology of PTL usually expressed prominent reactive features which is distinct from that in ATL. Several subcategories could be defined: Hodgkin's-like PTL in nine patients, T-zone lymphoma in three, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like lymphoma in one, Lennert's lymphoma in three, and angioinvasive lymphoma in four. Two HTLV-1-negative PTL had neoplastic cells with clover-shaped nuclei and were designated as ATL-like. Morphologic classification based on the modified Working Formulation showed prognostic correlation, with median survival of less than 6 months for large cell/immunoblastic PTL, compared with 5 years for patients with small/medium cell PTL. Both low- and high-grade PTL seem to represent an incurable disease. Classical cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (seven cases) is relatively unusual in Taiwan, compared with the frequency of PTL. Post-thymic T-cell malignancies in Taiwan include HTLV-1-positive and HTLV-1-negative diseases, both of which have a poor prognosis and resemble similar T-cell malignancies in the East and West.","['Su, I J', 'Wang, C H', 'Cheng, A L', 'Chen, Y C', 'Hsieh, H C', 'Chen, C J', 'Tien, H F', 'Woei-Tsay', 'Huang, S S', 'Hu, C Y']","['Su IJ', 'Wang CH', 'Cheng AL', 'Chen YC', 'Hsieh HC', 'Chen CJ', 'Tien HF', 'Woei-Tsay', 'Huang SS', 'Hu CY', 'et al.']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Taiwan']",1988/05/15 00:00,1988/05/15 00:01,['1988/05/15 00:00'],"['1988/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19880515)61:10<2060::aid-cncr2820611022>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 May 15;61(10):2060-70. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880515)61:10<2060::aid-cncr2820611022>3.0.co;2-d.,['1-FO5-TW03962-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the breakpoint in chromosome 22 is more heterogeneous and, in some instances, does not occur within this region. In such cases the cell of origin of the neoplastic clone and the relationship of the disease to CML has remained obscure. We have analyzed the bcr rearrangement in the malignant cells from three patients who presented with Ph1-positive ALL and who in cytogenetic studies had shown evidence of variable involvement of myeloid cells in the Ph1-positive clone. Rearrangements in bcr typical of most cases of CML were detected in purified granulocyte preparations from two of the ALL patients (nos. 1 and 2) and in the blasts from patient 3 at the time of her terminal relapse. In the same analysis the simultaneously obtained granulocytes from patient 3, however, did not show any evidence of bcr rearrangement. Patient 3 was also heterozygous for the BamHI polymorphism in the X-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene, thus permitting a different method of clonal analysis based on methylation differences in active and inactive alleles. When DNA from her granulocytes that had shown no bcr rearrangement was hybridized to an HPRT probe, a pattern typical of a polyclonal population was seen. A similar pattern was exhibited by her marrow fibroblasts. In marked contrast, her simultaneously isolated blasts showed an unambiguous monoclonal pattern. These findings demonstrate the origin of the disease in the first two patients in a cell with myelopoietic as well as lymphopoietic potential and confirm the restricted lymphoid cell origin of the neoplastic clone in the third Ph1-positive ALL patient. Furthermore, they indicate that different target cells for transformation within the hematopoietic system may be affected by very similar bcr rearrangements.","['Turhan, A G', 'Eaves, C J', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Eaves, A C', 'Humphries, R K']","['Turhan AG', 'Eaves CJ', 'Kalousek DK', 'Eaves AC', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Clone Cells/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fibroblasts/analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Granulocytes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77265-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 May;71(5):1495-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Respiratory distress developed during the cell separator run, which led us to ask whether the procedure could have changed the adhesive properties of her cells. C5a desarginine, N-f-Met-Leu-Phe, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen all failed to aggregate her lymphocytes in vitro, but arachidonic acid, excess free calcium, and 4 mumol/L epinephrine did aggregate the cells. Arachidonate-induced aggregation appeared to be a toxic phenomenon: the ED50 for aggregation was statistically indistinguishable from that for cytotoxicity, and aspirin only mildly blunted the response. In contrast, epinephrine-induced aggregation was not associated with lactic dehydrogenase release or the loss of trypan blue exclusion and was blunted by propranolol; radiopindolol-binding studies confirmed the presence of a beta-adrenergic receptor. There were approximately 3,000 receptors/cell, with no statistically significant difference between normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells or between B cells and T cells (separated by rosetting techniques). The Kd for the B cells' receptor, however, was less than that for T cells by a factor of ten (P less than .01). We conclude that B cells may aggregate when stimulated and that they--like T cells--have beta-adrenergic receptors. Adrenergically mediated changes in B cell adhesiveness may play a role in regulating lymphocyte traffic; in the rare patient with truly enormous B cell counts, we postulate that they may be an occasional cause of morbidity.","['Hammerschmidt, D E', 'Jeanneret, C', 'Husak, M', 'Lobell, M', 'Jacob, H S']","['Hammerschmidt DE', 'Jeanneret C', 'Husak M', 'Lobell M', 'Jacob HS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Citrates)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2968PHW8QP (Citric Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adrenergic beta-Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Citrates/pharmacology', 'Citric Acid', 'Dyspnea/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*drug effects']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77261-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 May;71(5):1470-4.,"['HL-07062/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-19725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-28935/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA and protein synthesis were reduced by these agents preferentially, with RNA synthesis being affected only marginally. This study focused on the identification of the enzyme target(s) responsible for the inhibition of DNA synthesis by the sesquiterpene lactones. Purine synthesis was strongly inhibited at the IMP dehydrogenase step. Suppression of IMP dehydrogenase activity and purine synthesis paralleled the DNA synthesis inhibition with respect to both dose dependence and time of incubation with drug. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools in the P-388 cells were significantly reduced by both drugs and the DNA polymerase alpha activity was only moderately inhibited by both drugs in cytoplasmic preparation. However, inhibition of a partially purified DNA polymerase alpha was of a much greater magnitude. Activity of the ribonucleotide reductase complex was reduced by more than 50% at 100 microM concentration of either drug. The drugs appeared to affect the hydrogen donor system of the reductase complex, since the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme itself was not affected but both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin were markedly inactivated by the sesquiterpene lactones. Thymidylate synthetase activity was not affected by the sesquiterpene lactones in P-388 cells. These data suggest that the inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase and the ribonucleotide reductase complex activities by helenalin and bis (helenalinyl) melonate was the primary reason for the observed inhibition of DNA synthesis, but that inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha may also play a role. The inhibition of the sensitive enzymes is likely to be related to drug alkylation of thiol active groups of the enzymes in a manner similar to the action of N-ethylmaleimide. The mode of action of helenalin and bis (helenalinyl) malonate does not appear to be similar to that of the parthenolide-type sesquiterpene lactones which contain an epoxide moiety.","['Hall, I H', 'Williams, W L Jr', 'Grippo, A A', 'Lee, K H', 'Holbrook, D J', 'Chaney, S G']","['Hall IH', 'Williams WL Jr', 'Grippo AA', 'Lee KH', 'Holbrook DJ', 'Chaney SG']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Natural Products School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane)', '0 (Terpenes)', '4GUY9L896T (helenalin)', '68322-91-8 (bis(helenalinyl)malonate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1988 Jan-Feb;8(1):33-42.,['CA-26466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FeLV-A is present in all natural isolates and is generally minimally pathogenic. FeLV-B is found with FeLV-A in isolates from approximately 40% of natural infections and in a higher percentage of cats with lymphoma. Following the fundamental observations of genetic reassortment of avian retroviruses with endogenous viral genes and the origination of lymphomagenic viruses during the ontogeny of AKR mice, we show here that transfection of feline cells with FeLV-A DNA results in its recombination with endogenous FeLV-related sequences to produce viruses with the structural and host range properties of FeLV-B.

No evidence of lineage restriction was found for either enzyme and it is concluded that variations in DAP cytochemical staining patterns reflect quantitative rather than qualitative differences.","['Scott, C S', 'Stark, A N', 'Minowada, J', 'Drexler, H G']","['Scott CS', 'Stark AN', 'Minowada J', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl peptidase II)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90072-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(2):129-34. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90072-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high rate of spontaneous somatic mutation in pre-B cells may initiate the development of c-ALL, but its progress could be determined by (i) a leukaemogenic agent causing a second genetic event, (ii) the effects of intense antigenic barrage, either stimulating or suppressing pre-B-cell mitosis, or (iii) genetic determinants. Epidemiological patterns in populations of low, intermediate and high socio-economic status may be classified I-III with increasing incidence of diagnosed T-ALL in children over five years and c-ALL in younger children, and subclassified A and B with decreasing incidence of BL. There may be two forms of AML, one similar to that seen in industrialized countries, the other occurring at high prevalence in African children of low socio-economic status, often presenting with chloroma, and perhaps associated with immune suppression secondary to malnutrition, malaria and other intercurrent infections. Uncontrolled exposure to petroleum and other chemicals, and the use of alkylating agents in treatment of neoplasms in young patients could emerge as important causes of ANLL in Africa. There are two varieties of CLL also, one similar to that seen in the western world, the other prevalent in adults below 45 years of age, especially women: transmission of a leukaemogenic agent is postulated, to which women are more susceptible due to immunosuppression during normal pregnancy. The human population and some subhuman primates of subSaharan Africa are the largest reservoir of HTLV-1, which shows association with B-CLL over 50 years of age and ATL.","['Fleming, A F']",['Fleming AF'],"['Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Ndola, Zambia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Africa', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80006-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(1):33-43. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)80006-4.,,,,,,,116,,,,,,,,

CEM cells constitutively maintain two distinct populations whereby a minority of cells (5 to 16%) express T3 but the remainder do not. From the parental cell line, we have derived stable subclones in which all cells express surface T3 and companion subclones that lack surface T3. Inasmuch as surface T3 expression is contingent on assembly and coexpression of the multichain T3 protein complex with the TCR, we compared the surface T3+ and T3- subclones for their rearrangement and expression of genes of the T3-TCR complex. Restricted DNA of both subclone types showed the identical monoclonal pattern of TCR gene rearrangement seen in the mosaic parental CEM line. Northern blot analysis revealed mRNA transcripts of TCR beta subunit and T3 delta in both the surface T3+ and T3- subclones. However, surface T3+ subclones transcribed abundant full length (1.5-kb) TCR alpha mRNA in contrast to the surface T3- subclones in which TCR alpha transcripts were undetectable. Lack of TCR alpha gene transcription was not attributable to either unrearranged or aberrantly rearranged TCR alpha genes because exposure of surface T3- cells to phorbol ester induced a rapid (15-min) and progressive accumulation of full length (1.5-kb) TCR alpha mRNA. This was followed by surface membrane T3 expression in 24 to 72 h.

Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of ADF is different from other cytokines such as, IFN, BSF-2, and various IL whose cDNA has been cloned. Western blot analysis using rabbit antibodies against N-terminal 10mer synthetic peptide of ADF showed that IL-1 alpha and ADF are different proteins.

General clinico-epidemiological findings on ATL and infectious modes of transmission of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) from 181 ATL patients and their relatives were analyzed and the frequency of HLA antigens in 64 ATL patients was compared with that of 48 relatives of ATL probands, 340 controls from all Japan and 236 controls from Kyushu (Tanaka et al., 1984). General findings on ATL were mostly the same as those in the 2 previous nation-wide studies. The age-specific positivity rate of anti-HTLV-I antibody in siblings of ATL patients was markedly higher than that in children of ATL patients. This suggests that there is a high risk of mothers of ATL patients transmitting HTLV-I to their children who may develop clinical ATL after reaching ATL risk age. Frequencies of HLA antigens A26 and B39, among patients with ATL in ATL-endemic areas (Kyushu and South Shikoku), were higher (RR greater than 2.0 and p less than 0.05) than those of controls in Kyushu, and lower (RR less than 0.5 and p less than 0.05) with respect to A24, Bw46, Bw52, Bw61 and DR7. The frequency of Bw52 was also lower in relatives positive for anti-HTLV-I antibody than in relatives without antibody.

The Thy-1 allele of the pre-B cell parent, however, is spontaneously activated in a minor proportion of hybrid cells. By sorting for cells expressing the Thy-1 allele of the pre-B cell parent, derivative clones in which 100% of cells express both parental Thy-1 alleles can be isolated. Revertants with a phenotype identical with that of the original hybrid cell line can be isolated from these derivatives by sorting for nonexpression of the Thy-1 allele of the pre-B cell parent. These first-generation revertant cell lines have lost one copy of the Thy-1 gene derived from the pre-B cell lymphoma parent. By a further cycle of sorting, derivatives in which 100% of cells express both parental Thy-1 alleles can again be obtained. Second-generation revertants isolated by sorting these Thy-1+ hybrid cells for nonexpression of the Thy-1 allele of the pre-B cell parent no longer contain a normal copy of the pre-B cell Thy-1 allele and this surface antigen is no longer expressed by any cells in the population. These results are consistent with a mechanism that sequentially activates each copy of the Thy-1 gene derived from the pre-B cell lymphoma parent. Hybrids between the class D Thy-1- mutant, AKR1 (Thy-1- d), in which the 5' region of the Thy-1 structural gene has been deleted, and RAW 253.1 cannot be activated to express either Thy-1 allele.

Because potential defects of immunoglobulin regulation are evident in B-CLL patients, we investigated one aspect of this by studying the T cell-mediated immunoglobulin isotype-specific immunoregulatory circuit in B-CLL. The existence of class-specific immunoglobulin regulatory mechanisms mediated by Fc receptor-bearing T cells (FcR + T) through soluble immunoglobulin binding factors (IgBFs) has been well established in many experimental systems. IgBFs can both suppress and enhance B cell activity in an isotype-specific manner. We investigated the apparently abnormal IgA regulation in a B-CLL patient (CLL249) whose B cells secrete primarily IgA in vitro. Enumeration of FcR + T cells showed a disproportionate increase in IgA FcR + T cells in the peripheral blood of this patient. Our studies showed that the neoplastic B cells were not intrinsically unresponsive to the suppressing component of IgABF produced from normal T cells, but rather the IgABF produced by the CLL249 host T cells was defective. CLL249 IgABF was unable to suppress IgA secretion by host or normal B cells and enhanced the in vitro proliferation of the host B cells. Size fractionation of both normal and CLL249 IgABF by gel-filtration high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated differences in the ultraviolet-absorbing components of IgABF obtained from normal T cells v that from our patient with defective IgA regulation. Such T cell dysfunction may not be restricted to IgA regulation, since we have found similar expansion of isotype-specific FcR + T cells associated with expansion of the corresponding B cell clone in other patients with B-CLL. These data suggest that this T cell-mediated regulatory circuit could be significantly involved in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Moore, J S', 'Prystowsky, M B', 'Hoover, R G', 'Besa, E C', 'Nowell, P C']","['Moore JS', 'Prystowsky MB', 'Hoover RG', 'Besa EC', 'Nowell PC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A, Secretory)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin A, Secretory/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology/metabolism']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77745-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Apr;71(4):1012-20.,"['CA-09140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half of the hypercalciuric patients with normocalcemia also showed high NcAMP and reduced serum 1,25(OH)2D levels. Furthermore, the changes in NcAMP and serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration closely paralleled the development of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in two patients.

In the present report we therefore present the results from growth kinetic studies of P388 and L1210 leukemic cells growing in ascites form in mice. We used 3H-TdR autoradiography, DNA flow cytometry and the stathmokinetic method. During exponential growth both leukemias showed a growth fraction of unity. Whereas no significant cell loss was observed during the early growth phase of P388 cells, cell loss was indicated by a discrepancy between potential and actual doubling times during exponential growth of L1210 cells. During the phase of growth retardation, the proportion of G1 and G2 cells increased at the expence of a reduced S phase fraction in the P388 leukemia, whereas only small changes in cell cycle distributions were seen with time after inoculation of L1210 cells. An increasing discrepancy in the reduction of the S phase fraction and the 3H-TdRLI was seen in the P388 cells with time after inoculation. Thus, a majority of P388 cells with S phase DNA content were unlabelled during the late phase of growth restriction, indicating resting cells in S phase. A good correlation was found between the 3H-TdR LI and S phase fraction throughout the life history of L1210 cells, revealing considerable differences in in vivo growth kinetics between the two leukemias. Such differences should be considered when evaluating test results.","['Clausen, O P', 'Bolstad, K G', 'Mjelva, E']","['Clausen OP', 'Bolstad KG', 'Mjelva E']","['Department of Pathology Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

The viruses encode at least three genes in addition to the genes (gag, pol, and env) required for virus replication. These additional genes encoded for by the X region are likely to affect in a specific fashion the growth of lymphocytes. The tat gene appears to mimick at least part of the response of mature lymphocytes to recognition of the cognate antigen. That is, in T-lymphocytes the tatI gene seems to induce the IL-2 and IL-2 receptor genes (W. Greene et al. 1986). The alternative reading-frame proteins, pp21 and pp27, have some similarity of cellular proteins that are associated with G0 to G1 transitions and may contribute to the transformed phenotype in cooperation with the tat gene. The expression of viral genes in infected lymphocytes, the tat gene and pp21 and pp27 proteins, and possibly other viral genes (since the coding capacity of the X region is not exhausted by the tat and pp21 and pp27 proteins) may be sufficient to account for the transformation of T cells in culture. A secondary change in the infected cells in culture is not required to explain the outgrowth of cells which are clonal with respect to the site of viral genomic integration, as selection of the most rapidly growing infected cell could account for this observation. The case of infected patients is more complex. Infection of T cells with the HTLV-I or -II virus is not sufficient to produce malignant disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Haseltine, W', 'Sodroski, J', 'Rosen, C']","['Haseltine W', 'Sodroski J', 'Rosen C']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Pathology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,,IM,"['Deltaretrovirus/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/etiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-72624-8_85 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1987;31:395-403. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-72624-8_85.,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,

In addition, class I HLA antigens of peripheral lymphocytes of patients with ATL, especially acute ATL, showed altered expression, either extra antigens or decreased antigens. Analysis of 21 families, where more than two members were Ab-positive, showed that there was no linkage between the HLA complex and susceptibility to the virus infection. In 44 couples, in which either or both spouses were Ab-positive, no association with class I HLA antigens was found in either Ab-positive spouses or Ab-negative spouses.

We have studied the resulting individual-specific DNA fingerprints in 15 patients before and after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation performed for chronic myeloid leukaemia and in two patients transplanted for acute leukaemia. Early engraftment could be demonstrated at 3 weeks post-transplant based on the recognition of cells of donor origin. One patient who failed to engraft had only recipient type marrow cells 3 months post-transplant. Nine patients who relapsed after transplantation had only cells of recipient origin. In one patient who relapsed after transplantation with T-cell depleted donor marrow, fractionation studies showed that his T-cells at relapse were of recipient origin.

Either A11Bw54Cw1DR4DQw3, A24Bw54Cw1DR4DQ-, A24B7Cw7DR1DQw1, or A24Bw52Cw-DR2DQw1 and the related haplotypes were found in 70% of cases with HAM. None of these ""HAM-associated"" haplotypes was found in patients with ATLL. HLA haplotypes made up of HLA components of A26Bw62Cw3DR5DQw3 and one particular haplotype of Aw33B44Cw-DRw6DQw1 were associated with the ATLL haplotypes. These ""ATLL-associated"" haplotypes were also found in the patients with HAM who had no previous history of blood transfusion. The in vitro cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes with HTLV-I virion antigens revealed that the response with HAM peripheral blood lymphocytes was remarkably higher than that with ATLL peripheral blood lymphocytes. Based on this HTLV-I-specific immune responsiveness, we can segregate the high responders in HAM (14 of 16 cases) and the low responders in ATLL (6 of 7 cases). The existence of high and low responders was also confirmed by the normal healthy individuals, whose responses were segregated with HAM-associated and ATLL-associated haplotypes. These results suggested that two ethnic groups in southern Kyushu may get the two different diseases, HAM and ATLL, because of their different immunogenetic backgrounds. The high immune response to HTLV-I seems to be an important genetic factor in the development of HAM.","['Usuku, K', 'Sonoda, S', 'Osame, M', 'Yashiki, S', 'Takahashi, K', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Sawada, T', 'Tsuji, K', 'Tara, M', 'Igata, A']","['Usuku K', 'Sonoda S', 'Osame M', 'Yashiki S', 'Takahashi K', 'Matsumoto M', 'Sawada T', 'Tsuji K', 'Tara M', 'Igata A']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Female', '*Genetic Linkage', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/immunology', '*Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*etiology/genetics/immunology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ana.410230733 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Neurol. 1988;23 Suppl:S143-50. doi: 10.1002/ana.410230733.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since glucocorticoids inhibit the growth of the human leukemia cell line CEM-C7, ketoconazole might be expected to reverse this inhibition. Unexpectedly, ketoconazole inhibited CEM-C7 cell growth without utilizing glucocorticoid receptors. This was confirmed by ketoconazole inhibition of the growth of a receptor-less subline of CEM-C7 cells which are insensitive to glucocorticoids. Ketoconazole competed with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in cell-free supernatant prepared from CEM-C7 cells, but this was greatly reduced if ketoconazole and TA were incubated with intact cells prior to preparation of the cell-free supernatant. Ketoconazole inhibited induction by TA of the enzyme glutamine synthetase only at concentrations of 45-90 microM. We conclude that ketoconazole antagonism of glucocorticoid activity in CEM-C7 cells is probably not of pharmacologic significance due to the large concentrations required, and its reduced interaction with receptors in intact cells. The growth inhibitory activity of ketoconazole may be of interest in cancer chemotherapy.","['Hackney, J F', 'Schwartz, D A']","['Hackney JF', 'Schwartz DA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa 33612.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0022-4731(88)90370-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1988 Jan;29(1):15-9. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(88)90370-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that another T cell-surface molecule than CD2 is involved in rosette formation. Four mAb have been obtained reacting with human T cells that block rosettes with E from many species, including autologous cells. They react with a molecule, we termed E2, which is actively synthetized by T and monocytic cells. Immunoprecipitation revealed a major 32-kDa band. Immunoblots revealed a major 32-kDa band and a minor 20-kDa band. This molecule was detected on all T cells tested--and present at high densities on corticothymocytes, but at low densities on medullary thymocytes. It was also found on monocytes but not on B cells. However B-CLL cells did carry this molecule. E2 molecules were also detected on nonhematologic cells. Together with the recent evidence that 3 molecules from the erythrocyte surface are also involved for rosettes, intricate molecular interactions would account for adhesion of T cells to autologous E and possibly autologous nucleated cells.","['Bernard, A', 'Aubrit, F', 'Raynal, B', 'Pham, D', 'Boumsell, L']","['Bernard A', 'Aubrit F', 'Raynal B', 'Pham D', 'Boumsell L']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs de l'Enfant, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/analysis', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic', '*Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Mar 15;140(6):1802-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied leukemic cell DNA from 42 CML patients for evidence of rearrangement and/or amplification of c-abl analogous to that described in the CML cell line K562. Using the enzymes Bgl II, Pst I, Xba I, seven patients demonstrated an atypical Southern blot pattern similar to that found in K562. Analysis of DNA from normal controls and skin fibroblast from one of the seven patients established that the atypical blot pattern was due to a restriction fragment length polymorphism rather than a gene rearrangement. Further analysis revealed that c-abl exists as two alleles, A and B, yielding three genotypes: AA, AB and BB. Inheritance was Mendelian. With respect to allele A, allele B contains a deletion of about 1 kb lying in a intronic region in close proximity to highly repetitive Alu sequences and the sequence coding for phosphotyrosine of the c-abl protein. K562 and the seven patients with similar Southern patterns were identified as AB heterozygotes. In K562, only the A allele was amplified. The frequencies of AA and AB genotypes in 37 Caucasian CML patients were 81.1% and 18.9% and in 57 unrelated normal Caucasian controls 87.7% and 12.3%, not significantly different. The BB genotype was identified in less than 1% of Caucasians. Of note, five AB patients who developed a terminal blast crisis demonstrated a 4:1 lymphoid:myeloid crisis ratio in contrast to a 2:7 lymphoid:myeloid crisis ration in nine AA patients and a similar ratio in mixed AA and AB historical controls. Otherwise, CML patients with AA and AB genotypes manifested similar clinical parameters. No patients demonstrated amplification of c-abl and analysis of four AB patients for loss of one c-abl allele during the course of their disease was negative. Thus, amplification of c-abl and loss of one c-abl allele are both infrequent in CML and do not play a significant role in the course of the disease.","['Daniel, L', 'Ahmed, C M', 'Bloodgood, R S', 'Kidd, J R', 'Castiglione, C M', 'Duttagupta, S', 'Lebowitz, P']","['Daniel L', 'Ahmed CM', 'Bloodgood RS', 'Kidd JR', 'Castiglione CM', 'Duttagupta S', 'Lebowitz P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1987 May;1(2):193-200.,['IF32 CA07871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an in vitro mRNA decay system, histone mRNA was degraded four- to sixfold faster in reaction mixtures containing core histones and a cytoplasmic S130 fraction than in reaction mixtures lacking these components. The decay rate did not change significantly when histones or S130 was added separately, suggesting either that the histones were modified and thereby activated by S130 or that additional factors besides histones were required. RecA, SSB (single-stranded binding), and histone proteins all formed complexes with histone mRNA, but only histones induced accelerated histone mRNA turnover. Therefore, the effect was not the result of random RNA-protein interactions. Moreover, histone proteins did not induce increased degradation of gamma globin mRNA, c-myc mRNA, or total poly(A)- or poly(A)+ polysomal mRNAs. This autoregulatory mechanism is consistent with the observed accumulation of cytoplasmic histone proteins in cells after DNA synthesis stops, and it can account, in part, for the rapid disappearance of histone mRNA at the end of S phase.","['Peltz, S W', 'Ross, J']","['Peltz SW', 'Ross J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rec A Recombinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Cell-Free System', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Globins/genetics', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rec A Recombinases/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.7.12.4345-4356.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Dec;7(12):4345-56. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.12.4345-4356.1987.,"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC368118,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum samples which were positive by IF were also positive by PA, whereas 2 of 26 IF-positive samples were negative by ELISA. All the samples positive by both PA and ELISA were shown to be positive by IF unequivocally. The samples positive by only one of the two methods (PA or ELISA) were different. Eleven and eight serum samples that were negative by IF but positive by PA and ELISA, respectively, were further studied for HTLV-I antibody by radioimmunoprecipitation. Three of the former but none of the latter were found to be positive for antibody. Moreover, a PA-positive but IF-negative serum sample was shown to have significantly decreased PA titers after 2-mercaptoethanol treatment.

Amonafide concentrations in plasma and urine were determined using reversed phase HPLC. Amonafide was eliminated from plasma with a terminal half-life of 3.5 hr. Renal excretion accounted for 23% of the administered dose. Amonafide pharmacokinetic parameters after the initial dose (day 1) were similar to those calculated after the fifth daily dose. Amonafide undergoes a significant amount of metabolism and eight urinary metabolites have been identified using a thermospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique. Various N-acetylated species appear to be the major metabolites, although no evidence of N-acetylation was found in urine obtained from two patients. Two of the primary metabolites, the N(N5)-acetyl and N'(N1)-oxide metabolites of Amonafide, were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against P388 murine leukemia cells. In this test system, the N-acetyl metabolite was observed to be only slightly less cytotoxic than the parent compound. The N'-oxide of Amonafide, however, proved to be inactive.

IL-2-R gene expression is induced by pharmacological agents including calcium ions, phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and forskolin (FK), a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. HTLV-I(+) leukemic T cells and T cell lines from patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) continuously expressed IL-2-R without production of IL-2. However, there was no abnormality of the structural gene for IL-2-R in these cell lines as well as in fresh leukemic cells of ATL. We have detected that many HTLV-I(+) T4(+) T cell lines constitutively produce a non-IL-2 lymphokine named ATL-derived factor (ADF), which induced the expression of the high-affinity IL-2-R on a variety of cells including HTLV-I(+) T cells, myeloid leukemia cells and YT cells.

The possible involvement of IL-2-R-inducing cytokines in the physiological lymphocyte activation and the leukemogenesis in ATL and other T cell leukemias is discussed.","['Yodoi, J', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Okada, M', 'Taniguchi, Y', 'Hirata, M', 'Naramura, M', 'Maeda, M']","['Yodoi J', 'Tagaya Y', 'Okada M', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Hirata M', 'Naramura M', 'Maeda M']","['Institute for Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205904 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1987;78 Suppl 1:56-63. doi: 10.1159/000205904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of case reports in warning of the association of blood dyscrasias to C/H exposure is emphasized. Until the voluntary halt in production in July 1987, millions of homes in the United States were treated with chlordane and heptachlor for termites even though their agricultural uses were phased out in 1978, largely on the grounds of ""imminent hazard"" because of carcinogenicity.

We investigated the mechanisms for acquired pure red cell aplasia and cutaneous anergy in a patient with the chronic T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease (T gamma-LPD) syndrome. Patient marrow erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) were 17 +/- 9% of control and were selectively increased to 88-102% of control after marrow T cell depletion. Patient Leu 2+ suppressor T cells spontaneously produced high titers of human gamma-interferon and resulted in a concentration-dependent selective inhibition (74-91%) of BFU-E when co-cultured with autologous or allogeneic marrow. Conditioned media (CM) derived from patient Leu 2+ T cells similarly inhibited growth of autologous or allogeneic marrow BFU-E. The inhibitory factor derived from patient CM was acid-labile (pH 2) and sensitive to trypsin; prior treatment of patient T cells with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody plus complement abrogated the suppressive effect of T cell-derived CM. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were unable to support growth of cultured interleukin 2 (IL 2)-dependent T cells, but responded to exogenous IL 2 in vitro with a 16-21-fold augmentation, relative to control, in mitogen-induced proliferation. Antibodies to HTLV-I core proteins p19 and p24 but not to HTLV-III proteins were detected in patient serum by Western blotting; patient cultured PBMC stained (7-11%) with antibodies to p19 and p24. Patient cultured PBMC demonstrated integrated HTLV-I genomic sequences by the Southern technique and expressed both specific HTLV-I genomic sequences by RNA dot blot plus reverse transcriptase activity. Utilizing a cloned DNA probe for the beta chain of the T cell receptor gene, patient PMBC demonstrated gene rearrangements providing presumptive evidence for clonality. The presence in serum of HTLV-I p19 and p24 antibodies, the expression of p19 and p24 core antigens on patient mononuclear cells, the evidence of HTLV-I proviral integration sequences and the expression of HTLV-I genomic sequences in patient cells, indicates infection with HTLV-I and raises the possibility of an etiologic link between human retrovirus infection and some instances of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T gamma-LPD).","['Levitt, L J', 'Reyes, G R', 'Moonka, D K', 'Bensch, K', 'Miller, R A', 'Engleman, E G']","['Levitt LJ', 'Reyes GR', 'Moonka DK', 'Bensch K', 'Miller RA', 'Engleman EG']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*physiopathology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*physiopathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI113352 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1988 Feb;81(2):538-48. doi: 10.1172/JCI113352.,['1 R01 HL-35774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC329602,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A morphometric study.,89-97,"A morphometric analysis was performed on trephine biopsies of the bone marrow to identify atypical megakaryocyte proliferation following PAS staining and the immunohistological demonstration of factor VIII. This study includes nine patients with a megakaryoblastic crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), four with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AM) and three with myeloid dysplasia later evolving into overt acute leukemia. Comparison and statistical evaluation of the PAS reaction with anti-factor VIII staining reveals that the latter technique not only facilitates the recognition of immature and abnormal megakaryocytes, but leads to a significantly increased count for all megakaryocytic elements in the bone marrow. Thus our retrospective investigation of routinely processed and paraffin-embedded trephine biopsies shows that the diagnosis of a megakaryoblastic crisis in CML as well as AM may be easily established with the aid of the anti-factor VIII method. In all cases of megakaryoblastic proliferation in CML and AM, the appearance of blasts was associated with moderate to pronounced myelofibrosis which could be also determined by morphometry.","['Thiele, J', 'Krech, R', 'Wienhold, S', 'Simon, K G', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Krech R', 'Wienhold S', 'Simon KG', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

Single-organism gram-negative bacteremia occurred in 129 of 872 evaluable patients. Without a change in antibiotics, the response rates were 81 percent with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin, 48 percent with ceftazidime and short-course amikacin (P = 0.002), and 40 percent with azlocillin and long-course amikacin (P less than 0.001). Among patients with fewer than 100 granulocytes per cubic millimeter throughout therapy, the response rates were 6 percent with ceftazidime and short-course amikacin and 50 percent with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin (P = 0.03). Linear logistic-regression analysis showed that therapy with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin was the most favorable prognostic factor of the response to infection, whereas the presence of leukemia or shock was the least favorable. We conclude that ceftazidime should be given in combination with a conventional full course of an aminoglycoside (amikacin) when used for the empirical treatment of gram-negative bacteremia in cancer patients with granulocytopenia.","['Calandra, Thierry', 'Klastersky, J', 'Gaya, H', 'Glauser, M P', 'Meunier, F', 'Zinner, S H']","['Calandra T', 'Klastersky J', 'Gaya H', 'Glauser MP', 'Meunier F', 'Zinner SH']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'HUM6H389W0 (Azlocillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Amikacin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Azlocillin/administration & dosage', 'Ceftazidime/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Random Allocation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sepsis/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology']",1987/12/31 00:00,1987/12/31 00:01,['1987/12/31 00:00'],"['1987/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198712313172703 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1987 Dec 31;317(27):1692-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198712313172703.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['EORTC International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group'],

The complete response (CR) rate and the 4-year survival rate of patients treated with VEPA-M was 62.2% and 36.9%, respectively, while for those treated with VEPA the rates were 51.9% and 26.6, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant, but pretreatment characteristics predictive for response and survival were interesting. Three factors, leukemic change, poor performance status (PS), and T cell marker, were negatively associated with both CR and survival rates, and high-grade pathology was adversely associated with survival rate in a multivariate analysis. These prognostic factors are somewhat different from those in Western lymphomas. This may be reflection of major differences in patients' characteristics between Japanese and Western lymphomas: in this study, there was a high incidence of T cell lymphoma/leukemia (50%) including ATL (33%), leukemic manifestation (34%), poor PS (34%), and a low incidence of follicular lymphoma (9%). The statistically significant three factors for both CR and survival rates were used to construct a model containing eight categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival. These categories were divided into four groups, with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 91% and 73%, 67% and 35%, 27% and 7%, and 10% and 5%. Ninety-three patients in whom CR was induced by VEPA or VEPA-M therapy were evaluated for prognostic factors predictive for disease-free survival. A shorter period (less than 28 days) required to achieve CR, a clinical diagnosis of ATL, and a lower hemoglobin level were found to affect disease-free survival adversely. These results have important implications for both the design of prospective randomized therapeutic trials and the determination of optimal therapy for individual patients.","['Shimoyama, M', 'Ota, K', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Yunoki, K', 'Konda, S', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Ichimaru, M', 'Ogawa, M', 'Kimura, I', 'Tominaga, S']","['Shimoyama M', 'Ota K', 'Kikuchi M', 'Yunoki K', 'Konda S', 'Takatsuki K', 'Ichimaru M', 'Ogawa M', 'Kimura I', 'Tominaga S', 'et al.']","['Hematology-Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'VAP-cyclo protocol', 'VEPA-M protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Random Allocation', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.1.128 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Jan;6(1):128-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.1.128.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, however, Southern blot analysis revealed no gross rearrangement or obvious amplification of the IL-2 receptor gene in ATL leukemic cells, indicating that abnormal IL-2 receptor expression in ATL is not due to the structural change of its gene. Hence, we studied the expression of the IL-2 receptor and HTLV-I at the RNA level during short-term cultures of leukemic cells from 9 ATL patients. Cytoplasmic dot hybridization and Northern hybridization revealed that fresh leukemic cells from seven of nine patients expressed a small amount of IL-2 receptor mRNA but HTLV-I RNA was undetectable in all cases. After cultures for up to 7 d, both IL-2 receptor mRNA and HTLV-I RNA (including pX message) expression concomitantly increased, whereas the amounts of other cellular genes, except for beta-actin, did not. The increases in their RNA expression were inhibited by early addition (within 12 h after the beginning of the culture) of cycloheximide, indicating that these increases are mediated by newly synthesized protein(s). These results strongly suggested that IL-2 receptor expression is closely associated with HTLV-I expression in leukemic cells from ATL patients.","['Umadome, H', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Hori, T', 'Tamori, S', 'Motoi, T', 'Araki, K', 'Uchino, H']","['Umadome H', 'Uchiyama T', 'Hori T', 'Tamori S', 'Motoi T', 'Araki K', 'Uchino H']","['First Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI113309 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1988 Jan;81(1):52-61. doi: 10.1172/JCI113309.,,PMC442472,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, purification of the P-glycoprotein while preserving its enzymatic activity has not been reported. In this study, we have purified the P-glycoprotein from the human myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line resistant to adriamycin (K562/ADM) by means of one-step immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein. The procedure was simple and efficiently yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous P-glycoprotein sample. By solubilization with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, the purified P-glycoprotein was found to have ATPase activity.

There are at least two forms of the cellular receptors for IL-2, one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. We have identified two IL-2 binding peptides, a 55-kd peptide reactive with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, and a novel 75-kd non-Tac IL-2 binding peptide. Cell lines bearing either the p55, Tac, or the p75 peptide alone manifested low-affinity IL-2 binding, whereas cell lines bearing both peptides manifested both high- and low-affinity receptors. Fusion of cell membranes from low-affinity IL-2 binding cells bearing the Tac peptide alone with membranes from a cell line bearing the p75 peptide alone generates hybrid membranes bearing high-affinity receptors. We propose a multichain model for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor in which both the Tac and the p75 IL-2 binding peptides are associated in a receptor complex. In contrast to resting T-cells, human T-cell lymphotropic virus I-associated adult T-cell leukemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 receptors. Because IL-2 receptors are present on the malignant T-cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia are being treated with either unmodified or toxin-conjugated forms of anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor.","['Waldmann, T A']",['Waldmann TA'],"['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.877511 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1987 Nov;75:11-5. doi: 10.1289/ehp.877511.,,PMC1474436,,,,,32,,,,,,,,

The epidemiology and natural history of MuLV and its associated lymphoma in wild mice were remarkably predictive of later events associated with human T-lymphotrophic virus infection and adult T-cell leukaemia in man. Striking similarities were noted in the exogenous mode of virus transmission, the regional and familial clustering of virus infection in association with specific lymphomas, the low pathogenicity and long latent period, the neurotropism, the virus stability and the nature of viral integration in resultant lymphomas. The wild mouse model was more accurate than the inbred mouse model in pointing the way to human disease.

Infection without neoplastic transformation has also been demonstrated in pigs, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees and rabbits and observed in capybaras and water buffaloes. Structurally and functionally, BLV is a relative of human T lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) since all three viruses show clear-cut sequence homologies. The pathology of the BLV-induced disease, most notably the absence of chronic viraemia, a long latency period and lack of preferred proviral integration sites in tumours, is similar to that of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma induced by HTLV-I. The most striking feature of the three naturally transmitted leukaemia viruses is the X region located between the env gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence. The X region contains several overlapping long open reading frames, one of which, designated XBL-1, encodes a trans-activator function capable of increasing the level of gene expression directed by BLV-LTR and is most probably involved in genetic instability of BLV-infected cells of the B-cell lineage. The 'genetic instability' may put the cell into a state of fragility, ready to move along a number of stages towards full malignancy. Little is known about these events and their causes and we present some theoretical possibilities. BLV infection has a worldwide distribution. In temperate climates the virus spreads mostly through iatrogenic transfer of infected lymphocytes. In warm climates and in areas heavily populated by haematophagous insects, there are indications of insect-borne propagation of the virus.","['Burny, A', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Kettmann, R', 'Mammerickx, M', 'Marbaix, G', 'Portetelle, D', 'Van den Broeke, A', 'Willems, L', 'Thomas, R']","['Burny A', 'Cleuter Y', 'Kettmann R', 'Mammerickx M', 'Marbaix G', 'Portetelle D', 'Van den Broeke A', 'Willems L', 'Thomas R']","['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics', 'Insect Vectors', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', '*Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/transmission', '*Retroviridae/genetics', '*Tumor Virus Infections']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1987;6(1):139-59.,,,,,,,110,,,,,,,,

To address this question, CEM and CEM/VLB100 cells [which express the multiple drug-resistant (MDR) phenotype via amplification of the P-glycoprotein gene] were characterized by several techniques including chromosome banding, in situ hybridization, Southern blotting, RNA dot blotting, in vitro drug sensitivity, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Analysis of the chromosome banding patterns of both drug-sensitive CEM cells and the MDR CEM/VLB100 cells revealed that the two lines differed primarily by the presence of a large metacentric marker chromosome associated with the acquisition of VLB resistance. In situ hybridization of a P-glycoprotein complementary DNA to metaphase chromosomes showed that the amplified P-glycoprotein genes in the CEM/VLB100 cell line were localized to this large marker. Tumorigenicity of both the CEM and CEM/VLB100 cell lines was measured after injection of 10(7) cells/nude mouse. The results showed that 4 of 4 drug-sensitive and 4 of 5 drug-resistant cell lines formed tumors in 5-10 wk. By comparison with the parental line, three of the four tumors arising from the CEM/VLB100 line retained their drug-resistance properties as measured by vinblastine resistance in vitro and elevated P-glycoprotein mRNA expression associated with P-glycoprotein gene amplification. In addition, tumors retaining the MDR phenotype also retained the large metacentric marker chromosome. One tumor arising from CEM/VLB100 reverted to the drug-sensitive phenotype, with a resultant decrease in P-glycoprotein mRNA expression and loss of P-glycoprotein gene amplification. This revertant was also missing the large metacentric marker present in all cells from the CEM/VLB100 parent. Our experiments show that the acquisition of the MDR phenotype resulting from overexpression of P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane does not effect the tumorigenicity of human CEM cells.","['Hill, A B', 'Beck, W T', 'Trent, J M']","['Hill AB', 'Beck WT', 'Trent JM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 15;48(2):393-8.,"['CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Highly elevated TGF-beta mRNA levels were observed in all five ATL cell samples tested; however, in three acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples, in one acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), and one chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), TGF-beta expression was relatively lower. In normal peripheral mononuclear cells TGF-beta mRNA was weakly detectable. Colony stimulating activity for NRK found in the conditioned medium from ATL cells as well as other leukemia cells correlated well with the levels of TGF-beta mRNA expression. In all three ATL samples tested, stimulation of 3H-thymidine uptake by purified TGF-beta from platelets was apparent. These results suggest that ATL cells are secreting active TGF-beta in a relatively high amount, as compared with other leukemia cells, and may proliferate in response to the factor via an autocrine manner. Furthermore, considering that TGF-beta stimulates bone resorption, we can speculate that the relatively high amount of TGF-beta in ATL cells contributes to the hypercalcemia frequently seen in ATL patients.","['Niitsu, Y', 'Urushizaki, Y', 'Koshida, Y', 'Terui, K', 'Mahara, K', 'Kohgo, Y', 'Urushizaki, I']","['Niitsu Y', 'Urushizaki Y', 'Koshida Y', 'Terui K', 'Mahara K', 'Kohgo Y', 'Urushizaki I']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78257-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jan;71(1):263-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An interim approach to diagnosis and classification.,1-67,"When immunophenotyping is used for diagnosis, it is essential to use panels of antibodies, rather than a single marker for a specific tumor type. There is virtually no single marker that is absolutely diagnostic and completely reliable for any particular neoplasm. For the most important clinical differential diagnoses--reactive versus neoplastic lymphoid lesions and lymphoma versus nonlymphoid tumor--relatively simple panels of antibodies are usually sufficient. In the former situation, immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (G, M, kappa, lambda) and a pan-T-cell antibody (Leu-4) will usually provide the answer. For the latter circumstance, kappa and lambda, a pan-leukocyte antibody, a pan-B-cell (B1), and a pan-T-cell antibody (Leu-4) along with cytokeratin constitute the initial panel. Further subclassification of lymphomas and leukemias can proceed using other antibodies as indicated in the preceding specific sections on the lymphomas. The use of specific antibodies for nonlymphoid tumors will be dictated by the morphologic appearance of the tumor. These may be used as a second panel if the initial screening does not establish a diagnosis of lymphoma. Performing and interpreting immunohistologic studies requires experience, and probably should not be attempted by laboratories that do not encounter a large number of lymphomas. Frozen tissue can be obtained and stored at -20 degrees for a few days; if immunohistologic studies are deemed necessary, the frozen tissue can be sent on dry ice to a reference laboratory. In preparing biopsy specimens for immunohistologic studies, and in interpreting the results of these studies, it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that morphology remains the most important tool for the diagnosis and subclassification of hematologic neoplasms. Obtaining tissue for marker studies should not be permitted to interfere with adequate morphologic examination. Similarly, artifacts and technical problems can occasionally lead to misleading results; the immunohistologic studies must be interpreted in light of the case as a whole, and should never be allowed to contradict common sense.","['Harris, N L']",['Harris NL'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pathol Annu,Pathology annual,0050610,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genotype', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*diagnosis/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Annu. 1987;22 Pt 2:1-67.,,,,,,,141,,,,,,,,

Cellular immune response was suppressed in most ATL patients when examined by skin hypersensitivity reaction to purified protein derivatives (PPD), streptococcal antigens (SuPs), and phytohaemoagglutinin (PHA). None of the CMV-positive patients reacted to them. Thus, the presence of tumor cells of T-cell origin and the absence of skin hypersensitivity reaction seem to be risk factors for CMV infection.

No intravenous drug users were included in this trial. Three men (0.4%) were HTLV-I antibody positive at intake and an additional 2 at the end of the observation period, resulting in an attack rate of approximately 0.3%. One of the 3 men with HTLV-I antibodies at intake was a Brazilian. One man had an acute HTLV-I infection after sexual intercourse with a Brazilian during holiday in Brazil. No serological cross-reactivity with HIV was observed nor a relationship with other sexually transmissible viral or bacterial infections. In contrast to HIV no relationship with anogenital intercourse was noted; both primary HTLV-I infected men practiced only orogenital intercourse. This suggests that HTLV-I was imported in the Dutch homosexual community after HIV was introduced in the Netherlands.

Our results suggest that latently infecting HTLV-I may induce altered HLA phenotypes in T and B cells, primarily with loss of HLA antigens in a population of asymptomatic virus carriers, and secondarily with a gain of HLA antigens after the development of ATLL.","['Sonoda, S', 'Yashiki, S', 'Takahashi, K', 'Arima, N', 'Daitoku, Y', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Tara, M', 'Shinmyozu, K', 'Sato, K']","['Sonoda S', 'Yashiki S', 'Takahashi K', 'Arima N', 'Daitoku Y', 'Matsumoto M', 'Matsumoto T', 'Tara M', 'Shinmyozu K', 'Sato K', 'et al.']","['Dept. of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910400510 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1987 Nov 15;40(5):629-34. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910400510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result of the cell surface marker analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was compatible with ATL and anti-ATL associated antibody (ATLA) was positive. The integration of proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of human T-cell leukemia virus type I(HTLV-I) was proved in the peripheral blood lymphocytes using Southern blot hybridization. Since an ordinal chemotherapy was not so effective for this patient, he was treated with 1.8 X 10(7) units of recombinant beta-interferon (beta-IFN) per day for 7 days as one course. After 5 courses of treatment, a markedly favorable response was recognized, and he achieved complete remission. A lower dose of beta-IFN (9 X 10(6) units per day for 3 days as one course, one or two courses per month) has been continued and he has still been in a complete remission state for 10 months.

Using DNA restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs), we have evaluated the feasibility of developing a single synthetic oligonucleotide probe to study post-BMT chimerism. We have thus tested three candidate probes, termed O-3315-32, O-3315-80, and O-AY-29, that are homologous to tandemly repetitive sequences. Our results demonstrated donor-specific and recipient-specific fragments in 11 of 11 HLA-matched sibling pairs tested using probes O-3315-32 and O-3315-80. When probe O-AY-29 was used, 14 of 17 sibling pairs showed both donor and recipient markers, one had only a recipient marker, and two were identical. We showed that each of the three synthetic probes was effective in documenting donor marrow engraftment, mixed hematopoietic chimerism, the patient's pre-BMT phenotype (by using cultured skin fibroblasts obtained after BMT), and the origin of the malignant hematopoietic cells (i.e., of donor or recipient origin) in patients who developed recurrent hematologic malignancy following BMT. Compared with the use of cloned genomic probes, there are several important advantages to the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes in studying post-BMT chimerism. Synthetic probes have absolute hybridization specificity and can be designed to suit the purposes of an individual study, since they have adjustable specificity that can be altered by changes in the length of the probe and by changes in the hybridization temperature. A single synthetic probe analogous to several highly polymorphic loci can have a polymorphism information content sufficiently high so that all but a small percentage of BMT patients could be followed easily; for example, if a probe were complementary to three highly polymorphic unlinked loci, it would discriminate approximately 98% of sibling donor/recipient pairs. This would be accomplished using only one restriction-endonuclease digestion and only one gel electrophoresis. Since other genetic markers, e.g., red blood cell antigens, immunoglobulin allotypes, and chromosome analysis, are not uniformly informative and, in some cases, cannot be used in the early posttransplantation period, the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes for analysis of DNA RFLP is emerging as the method of choice for studies of post-BMT chimerism. This method will allow for the development of new knowledge that has not been possible with previous methods.","['Yam, P', 'Petz, L D', 'Ali, S', 'Stock, A D', 'Wallace, R B']","['Yam P', 'Petz LD', 'Ali S', 'Stock AD', 'Wallace RB']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chimera', 'Graft Rejection', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1987 Nov;41(5):867-81.,"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1684336,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They exist in many animal species as well as in man. Exogenous virus strains are horizontally transmitted between individuals of a given species, like all other virus groups. Endogenous virus strains have managed some time during evolution to infect germ line cells like oocytes and spermatocytes and are thus transmitted vertically from parents to offspring. Several retrovirus strains possess oncogenes, i.e., acutely tumor-inducing genes. There are four human retrovirus strains so far. The initially discovered strain, HTLV-I, is accepted to be a co-factor in the development of an acute T-cell leukemia in adults. HTLV-II has repeatedly been isolated from cells of patients with hairy cell leukemia. Its etiological significance is unclear at present. HTLV-III/LAV-1, now designated HIV-1, is the causative agent of AIDS. HTLV-IV and LAV-2 are additional HIV-1 related strains and are supposed to cause AIDS as well.

The order of antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of naturally occurring marine prostanoids against HL-60 cells was chlorovulone I greater than bromovulone I = iodovulone I greater than clavulone I or II greater than prostaglandin A2. The IC50 (concentrations required to inhibit cell growth by 50%) value (0.03 microM (0.01 microgram/ml)) and cytotoxic effects (greater than 0.3 microM (0.1 microgram/ml)) of chlorovulone I were about 200 and 100 times stronger than those of prostaglandin A2, respectively, on the molar basis. From our data on the structure-activity relationship of the halogenated coral prostanoids and the related compounds, we elucidated that 1) the alkylidencyclopentenone structure in these prostanoids was essential for the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities against HL-60 cells and the introduction of halogen function at C-10 position in the structure enhanced the activities (C1 = F greater than Br = I greater than H); 2) the stereospecificity of the 12-hydroxyl group in the chlorovulone molecule was not required for the activities; 3) the presence of dienone (C5-6 and C7-8) in the structure potentiated the activities. Bivariate DNA/bromodeoxyuridine analysis with a flow cytometer showed that chlorovulone I transiently arrested the cell cycle progression from G1 to S after 24-hr exposure to the nontoxic concentrations (0.03 and 0.09 microM) and caused the lasting blockade of leukemia cells in G1 at the cytotoxic concentration. These results suggest that these coral prostanoids and related compounds may be a promising antileukemic agent.","['Honda, A', 'Mori, Y', 'Iguchi, K', 'Yamada, Y']","['Honda A', 'Mori Y', 'Iguchi K', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo College of Pharmacy, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Halogens)', '0 (Prostaglandins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Cnidaria', 'Cytotoxins', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Halogens/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Prostaglandins/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Oct;32(4):530-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gene restriction fragment polymorphism, due to a partial deletion of one of the alleles of this gene in HL-60, was not observed in the BII cells. Furthermore, the p53 oncogene, most of which is deleted in the HL-60 cell line, was found to be intact in the BII cell line. Human leukocyte antigen typing revealed that the two cell lines shared the A locus but differed at the B locus.

Syngeneity of the twins was established by conventional methods in the first 2 patients. These included the similarity of phenotype, dermatoglyphics and analysis of red cell isoenzymes and blood groups. 2 of the other patients had received multiple blood transfusions prior to referral for BMT thereby invalidating red cell analysis. However genetic identity was confirmed in these patients by the method of DNA 'finger-printing' which demonstrated identical restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. Conclusive proof of syngeneity in twins prior to BMT is important since it obviates the need for T-cell depletion and/or post-graft immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). All 5 patients were conditioned with high-dose chemoradiotherapy prior to BMT and all patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 12 months.

Fifth International Workshop on Chromosomes in Leukemia-Lymphoma.,1554-64,"To correlate cytogenetic findings with histology and immunophenotype, 260 newly diagnosed patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 31 with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) were studied at the Fifth International Workshop on Chromosomes in Leukemia-Lymphoma. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in 85% of cases of NHL and in all cases of ATL. The most significant associations of histology with cytogenetics involved the 8q24 and 14;18 translocations. Of 23 NHL patients with an 8q24 translocation, 20 (87%) had small noncleaved cell (SNC) lymphoma. Of 57 NHL patients with a t(14;18)(q32;q21), 37 (65%) had a follicular lymphoma, and at least 13 others (23%) had a diffuse lymphoma of follicular center cell origin. Five others including two who also had an 8q24 translocation had SNC lymphoma; tumors in these patients lacked the monomorphic features seen in those with only an 8q24 translocation. The most striking associations of immunology with cytogenetics involved rearrangements of 14q11-13, abnormalities of 1p, trisomy 3, and trisomy 12. Abnormalities of 14q11-13 were correlated with T cell disease. Among 138 NHL and 24 ATL cases that lacked involvement of 8q24, t(14;18), or rearrangements of 14q11-13, abnormalities of 1p and trisomy 3 were significantly associated with the T cell phenotype (P less than .01) and trisomy 12 with the B cell phenotype (P less than .01). No karyotype difference was found between Japanese ATL and non-Japanese T cell lymphomas except that +3 occurred more often in the former (P = .06). Although the 8q24 translocations in 23 patients were distributed relatively equally among geographic regions (United States, ten; Europe, ten; Japan, three), the t(14;18) in 57 patients was much less frequently seen in Japan than in the other parts of the world (United States, 31; Europe, 21; Australia, four; Japan, one). Thirty-nine chromosome bands had breaks in five or more cases; a number of protooncogenes and genes related to lymphocyte function located in these bands are likely to be involved in the development of lymphoma. Thus, besides confirming the close association of particular chromosome abnormalities with histology, we have identified a number of new associations that merit molecular analysis.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79543-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Nov;70(5):1554-64.,['CA 19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMP dehydrogenase was purified approx. 770-fold from the P-388 lymphocytic leukemia tumor cell line. The Km values for the substrates, IMP and NAD, were determined to be 12 microM and 25 microM, respectively. Xanthine monophosphate (XMP) was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 67 microM. Mycophenolic acid gave mixed-type inhibition with a Ki of 8 nM for the noncompetitive component and a Ki of 2 nM for the competitive component. Dissociation constants (Kd) and rate constants for inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase by nine different sesquiterpene lactones were determined. The highest Kd was seen with 2,3-dihydrohelenalin while the lowest Kd was observed with bis-helenalinyl malonate. Binding of the drugs by IMP dehydrogenase increased as the size of the drug increased. Also, changes in structure at position 6 had a relatively large effect on the Kd. There was no correlation with hydrophobicity, as determined by octanol/water partition. The first-order rate constants for the reaction of the sesquiterpene lactones with IMP dehydrogenase (k1) and the second-order rate constants for the reaction of the sesquiterpene lactones with glutathione (k2) were also determined. The rate constants for most of the sesquiterpene lactones with the alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone moiety were similar and were approximately twice as great as the rate constants for those sesquiterpene lactones with only the alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclopentenone ring. Microlenin had approximately 5-times the reactivity of the other sesquiterpene lactones towards IMP dehydrogenase, but had approximately the same reactivity towards glutathione, suggesting that it was bound to the enzyme in a way which facilitated its reaction with one or more essential sulfhydryls. The same procedure was used for a series of N-substituted maleimide compounds with the N-substituent ranging in size from a methyl group to a benzyl group. The binding of the maleimide compounds was generally tighter than for the sesquiterpene lactones and there was an increase in binding with size.","['Page, J D', 'Chaney, S G', 'Hall, I H', 'Lee, K H', 'Holbrook, D J']","['Page JD', 'Chaney SG', 'Hall IH', 'Lee KH', 'Holbrook DJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27514.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', '523-98-8 (xanthosine monophosphate)', '60622-41-5 (microlenin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthine']",1987/11/06 00:00,1987/11/06 00:01,['1987/11/06 00:00'],"['1987/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(87)90236-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(87)90236-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Nov 6;926(2):186-94. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(87)90236-4.,"['5T32 ES-07126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This NPA most frequently affected parametrial tissues and/or ovaries of females and small arterioles of the major salivary glands. Electron microscopic studies of early arterial lesions revealed massive budding of C-type particles from arterial smooth muscle cells just before or at the onset of arteritis. In addition, binding of mouse IgG and C3 to the plasma membrane of virus-producing smooth muscle cells was shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Antibody-bound muscle cells showed disintegration of their plasma membrane, but degeneration and necrosis of muscle cells were not associated with dense infiltration of neutrophils. SL/Ni mice had natural antibodies that bound specifically to a fibroblast cell line infected with an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) recovered from a SL/Ni mouse. Most of the natural antibodies were cytotoxic in the presence of murine complement. Western blot immunoassays revealed that among 14 SL/Ni female mice tested, all of the 9 mice that were affected by arteritis had anti-gp70 antibodies, while the 3 anti-gp70- mice were not affected. The presence of anti-p30 or anti-p15 (anti-p12) antibodies, which were also detected in some SL/Ni mice, did not correlate with the development of arteritis. These results strongly support the hypothesis that NPA in SL/Ni mice is mediated by the lysis of arterial smooth muscle cells due to the deposition of cytotoxic natural antibodies directed to cell membrane-bound gp70 molecules of an endogenous ecotropic MuLV.","['Miyazawa, M', 'Nose, M', 'Kawashima, M', 'Kyogoku, M']","['Miyazawa M', 'Nose M', 'Kawashima M', 'Kyogoku M']","['Department of Pathology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Arteritis/*etiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*immunology', 'Polyarteritis Nodosa/etiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology', 'Virion/analysis']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.166.4.890 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1987 Oct 1;166(4):890-908. doi: 10.1084/jem.166.4.890.,,PMC2188704,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K. Danks et al., Cancer Res., 47: 1297-1301, 1987). Compared to CEM/VLB100, which is a well characterized ""classic"" multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell line, the CEM/VM-1 cells display ""atypical"" multidrug resistance (at-MDR) in that they are cross-resistant to a wide variety of natural product antitumor drugs, except the Vinca alkaloids, and they are not impaired in their ability to accumulate radiolabeled epipodophyllotoxin. We have extended our characterization of this at-MDR cell line in the present study. In comparison to CEM/VLB100 cells, we found that CEM/VM-1 cells are not cross-resistant to either actinomycin D or colchicine. Verapamil and chloroquine, which enhance the cytotoxicity of vinblastine in CEM/VLB100 cells, had little or no ability to do so in the CEM/VM-1 cells. Membrane vesicles of the two resistant sublines were examined for overexpression of the MDR-associated plasma membrane protein (P-glycoprotein, Mr 170,000 protein, or 180,000 glycoprotein) by photoaffinity labeling with the vinblastine analogue N-(p-azido[3-125I]salicyl)-N'-beta-aminoethylvindesine. We were unable to visualize the MDR-associated protein in the CEM/VM-1 membranes with this photoaffinity probe under conditions in which the P-glycoprotein was readily seen in the membranes of CEM/VLB100 cells. Furthermore, no hybridization of the pMDR1 complementary DNA was seen in slot-blot analyses of the RNA from at-MDR cells, indicating that the mdr gene coding for P-glycoprotein is not overexpressed as is the case in the classic MDR cells. However, cytogenetic analysis indicated that the CEM/VM-1 cells contained an abnormally banded region on chromosome 13q, suggesting that a gene other than mdr may be amplified in these cells. Thus, despite the two cell lines having approximately equal degrees of resistance to epipodophyllotoxins, our data indicate that the mechanism(s) responsible for at-MDR is different from that for classic, P-glycoprotein-associated MDR.","['Beck, W T', 'Cirtain, M C', 'Danks, M K', 'Felsted, R L', 'Safa, A R', 'Wolverton, J S', 'Suttle, D P', 'Trent, J M']","['Beck WT', 'Cirtain MC', 'Danks MK', 'Felsted RL', 'Safa AR', 'Wolverton JS', 'Suttle DP', 'Trent JM']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Chloroquine/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Colchicine/therapeutic use', 'Dactinomycin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Podophyllotoxin/therapeutic use', 'Teniposide/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Verapamil/therapeutic use', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use', 'Vinca Alkaloids/therapeutic use']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Oct 15;47(20):5455-60.,"['CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biologically, however, although it induces some phorbol ester responses such as mitogenesis in Swiss 3T3 cells, it paradoxically blocks the effects of the phorbol esters on differentiation in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and Friend erythroleukemia cells. Since the phorbol esters induce proliferation and terminal differentiation in distinct subpopulations of epidermal basal cells, we have now examined the action of bryostatin 1 in that system. Bryostatin 1 decreased epidermal growth factor binding and induced ornithine decarboxylase activity, the latter a marker of proliferation. The magnitude of the maximal induction of ornithine decarboxylase was less than for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Bryostatin 1 only transiently caused the morphological change typical of phorbol ester treatment and did not induce transglutaminase or cornified envelope production, markers of the differentiative pathway. Combined treatment with bryostatin 1 and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate gave similar results to treatment with bryostatin 1 alone, i.e., slight reduction to complete inhibition of phorbol ester action, depending on the response. The mechanism may reflect time dependent block of the protein kinase C pathway by bryostatin 1 in this system; although bryostatin 1 inhibited epidermal growth factor binding at short incubation times (1-2 h), by 4 h of incubation its inhibition was markedly reduced and it correspondingly blocked inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Since induction of terminal differentiation is proposed to be an essential component of phorbol ester mediated tumor promotion in skin, our findings suggest that bryostatin 1 may function as an inhibitor of phorbol ester promotion.","['Sako, T', 'Yuspa, S H', 'Herald, C L', 'Pettit, G R', 'Blumberg, P M']","['Sako T', 'Yuspa SH', 'Herald CL', 'Pettit GR', 'Blumberg PM']","['Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Promotion Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bryostatins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Epidermis/drug effects', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transglutaminases/metabolism']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Oct 15;47(20):5445-50.,"['CA-16049-07-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16049-07-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exons 2 and 4 were derived from a gene duplication event and unexpectedly also are homologous to the recognition domain of human complement factor B. Receptor gene transcription is initiated at two principal sites in normal activated T cells. Adult T cell leukemia cells infected with HTLV-I show activity at both of these sites, but also at a third transcription initiation site. Resting T cells do not contain detectable IL-2 receptor mRNA. Within 1 hour after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a large, presumably nuclear precursor RNA species is seen, which then gradually disappears. Mature IL-2 receptor mRNA forms appear within 8 hours after stimulation, reach peak levels between 8 and 24 hours, and then decline. Thus in PHA-activated lymphocytes the rise and fall in IL-2 receptor mRNA levels precede by more than 24 hours the peak and decline of IL-2 receptor protein expression occurring at the cell surface. Nuclease S1-protection assays indicate that IL-2 receptor mRNAs may differ in length due to the use of three different polyadenylylation signals. Further, these assays demonstrate the presence of transcripts that lack a 216-base segment within the protein-coding region and thus do not encode a functional IL-2 receptor. Nuclear transcription assays indicate that the increase in IL-2 receptor mRNA is reflected at the level of transcription. Thus, IL-2 receptor gene regulation controls IL-2 receptor expression at the cell surface and is intimately linked to the control of T-cell proliferation.","['Kronke, M', 'Leonard, J', 'Depper, M', 'Greene, W']","['Kronke M', 'Leonard J', 'Depper M', 'Greene W']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Behring Inst Mitt,Behring Institute Mitteilungen,0367532,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['DNA/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/physiopathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Behring Inst Mitt. 1987 Jun;(81):60-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptor is a 55-Kd glycoprotein comprised of 272 amino acids including a single 19-amino transmembrane domain and a short intracytoplasmic domain composed of 13 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. Normal resting T cells and most leukemic T-cell populations examined did not express IL-2 receptors; however, the leukemic cells of all patients with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) expressed the Tac antigen. In HTLV-I-infected cells, the 42-Kd long open reading frame (tat) protein encoded in part by the tat region of HTLV-I may act as a transacting activator that induces transcription of the IL-2 receptor gene, thus providing an explanation for the constant association of HTLV-I infection of lymphoid cells and IL-2 receptor expression. The constant display of large numbers of IL-2 receptors which may be aberrant in the ATL cells may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of these leukemic T cells.

To that end, a partially conserved immunoreactive epitope was identified in the transmembrane glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2. Synthetic peptides derived from these conserved domains were used in sensitive and specific immunoassays that detect antibodies in sera from patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2. By making single amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 peptide, it was possible to demonstrate HIV-1 strain-specific antibody responses to this epitope. Such custom-designed peptides synthesized from this domain are likely to detect newly discovered HIV types, define infection with specific HIV strains, and allow detection of group-common antibodies.","['Gnann, J W Jr', 'McCormick, J B', 'Mitchell, S', 'Nelson, J A', 'Oldstone, M B']","['Gnann JW Jr', 'McCormick JB', 'Mitchell S', 'Nelson JA', 'Oldstone MB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Peptides', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1987/09/11 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/09/11 00:00'],"['1987/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2888192 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1987 Sep 11;237(4820):1346-9. doi: 10.1126/science.2888192.,"['AI-07007/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-12428/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-NS-07078/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice that expressed the authentic tat protein under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat were generated, and cell types that are permissive for the viral promoter and the effects of the tat gene on these cells were studied. Three of eight founder mice with high levels of expression of the transgene in muscle were bred and then analyzed. All developed soft tissue tumors at multiple sites between 13 to 17 weeks of age. This phenotype was transmitted to nine of nine offspring that inherited the tat gene and were available for analysis. The remaining five founders expressed the transgene in the thymus, as well as in muscle. This second group of mice all exhibited extensive thymic depletion and growth retardation; in all of these mice, death occurred between 3 to 6 weeks of age before tumors became macroscopically visible. The tat gene under the control of the HTLV-1 regulatory region showed tissue-specific expression and the tat protein efficiently induced mesenchymal tumors.

The molecular regulators of normal and leukaemic blood cells.",289-312,"The development of a cell-culture system for the cloning and clonal differentiation of different types of blood cell has made it possible to identify: (i), the proteins that regulate growth and differentiation of different cell lineages in normal and leukaemic blood cells; (ii), the molecular basis of normal and abnormal control of cell development in blood-forming tissue; and (iii), how to suppress malignancy in leukaemic cells. By using myeloid blood cells as a model system, it has been shown that normal blood cells require different proteins to induce cell viability and multiplication (growth-inducers) and differentiation (differentiation-inducers), that there is a hierarchy of growth-inducers which act at various stages of cell development, and that a growth-inducer can switch on production of a differentiation-inducer. Gene cloning has established a multigene family for these proteins. Identification of these proteins and their interaction has shown how growth and differentiation are regulated in normal development and demonstrated the mechanisms that uncouple growth and differentiation so as to produce malignant cells. Normal cells require an external source of growth-inducing protein for cell viability and multiplication. Cells can become leukaemic by genetically changing this normal requirement for growth without blocking response to normal differentiation-inducers. The mature cells induced by adding these normal protein-inducers are then no longer malignant. Other genetic changes which inhibit differentiation by the normal blood-cell regulatory proteins can occur in the evolution of leukaemia. But even these leukaemic cells may still be induced to differentiate by other compounds that can induce differentiation by alternative pathways. The differentiation of leukaemic to mature cells, which stops the cells from multiplying, results in the suppression of malignancy by bypassing genetic changes that produce the malignant phenotype. The activity of blood-cell growth- and differentiation-inducing proteins has been shown in culture and in the body. They can, therefore, be clinically useful to correct defects in the development of normal and leukaemic blood cells.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The patient received 1.7 X 10(8) nucleated cells/kg bodyweight containing 63 X 10(4) myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM)/kg bodyweight. Trilineage engraftment was evident in the bone marrow seven days after the graft. Normal neutrophil and platelet counts were attained by day 17, on which day the patient was discharged from hospital. He remained in complete remission three months after the graft with normal blood counts and bone-marrow cellularity. The rapid and sustained haemopoietic activity in this patient, in conjunction with our previous experience of four other patients who received autografts with peripheral blood stem cells, supports the concept we have proposed that a minimum CFU-GM dose of 50 X 10(4)/kg bodyweight produces complete and sustained engraftment. The rapid recovery minimizes aplasia-related risks and suggests that such autografting can be carried out safely in first remission even in older patients.

ATL cells often abnormally express interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors, and ATL patients may show clinical evidence of hypercalcemia, osteolytic bone lesions, or increased bone turnover. Whereas interleukin 1 (IL-1) is not generally recognized as a product of T cells, this cytokine is capable of both altering IL-2 receptor expression and activating osteoclasts. Thus, we investigated the possibility that primary ATL leukemic T cells and HTLV-I-infected long-term ATL cell lines produce IL-1. S1 nuclease protection assays demonstrated that primary leukemic ATL cells from five out of six patients, as well as one patient with T4+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia, contained considerable quantities of IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) and small amounts of IL-1 alpha mRNA. These primary leukemic T cells also released biologically active IL-1 protein as evaluated in the murine thymocyte comitogenesis bioassay. In contrast to primary tumor cells, four out of six long-term ATL cell lines produced variable amounts of IL-1 alpha mRNA in the absence of detectable IL-1 beta mRNA as measured by S1 nuclease protection. These data demonstrate that IL-1 gene (especially IL-1 beta) expression occurs in many primary HTLV-I-infected leukemic T cells raising the possibility that this mediator may play a role in the pathological changes associated with this leukemia. Also, these studies show that the pattern of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta gene expression differs between primary ATL tumor cells and long-term cultured ATL cell lines, indicating an interesting biological difference in these two HTLV-I-infected cell populations.","['Wano, Y', 'Hattori, T', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Chua, A O', 'Gubler, U', 'Greene, W C']","['Wano Y', 'Hattori T', 'Matsuoka M', 'Takatsuki K', 'Chua AO', 'Gubler U', 'Greene WC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI113152 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1987 Sep;80(3):911-6. doi: 10.1172/JCI113152.,,PMC442321,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined three HTLV-I-transformed lymphocyte cell lines, two HTLV-II-transformed lymphocyte cell lines, and six HTLV-negative B and T-lymphocyte leukemia cell lines for metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3). One HTLV-I-positive cell line, designated S-LB1, converted the substrate 25OH-[3H]D3 to several more polar metabolites, which were identified by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis as putative 1,25-(OH)2D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25-(OH)2D3], and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,24,25-(OH)3D3]. The other cell lines gave no evidence of 25OH-[3H]D3 metabolism. Likewise, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes did not metabolize 25OH-[3H]D3. The characteristics of 25OHD3 metabolism by S-LB1 cells were investigated in more detail. Kinetic studies revealed average Km values of 92 and 383 nM for 25OHD3 1-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase, respectively. Time-course studies showed that both 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 and 24,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 were further metabolized by S-LB1 cells to more polar compounds [primarily 1,24,25-(OH)3D3] and to compounds from which part of the side-chain had been cleaved. Exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1) inhibited endogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 production, (2) stimulated 24,25-(OH)2D3 production, and (3) stimulated production of compounds more polar than 1,25-(OH)2D3. Bovine PTH-(1-34) had no effect on 25OH-[3H]D3 metabolism by S-LB1 cells. Our results indicate that the 25OH-[3H]D3-metabolizing system of cultured HTLV-I-transformed S-LB1 lymphocytes is similar but not identical to that of kidney cell culture systems. It appears, however, that infection of lymphocytes with HTLV does not uniformly result in acquisition of the competence to metabolize 25OHD3.","['Reichel, H', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Norman, A W']","['Reichel H', 'Koeffler HP', 'Norman AW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,['P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Calcifediol/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Deltaretrovirus', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/complications/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/etiology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem-65-3-519 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1987 Sep;65(3):519-26. doi: 10.1210/jcem-65-3-519.,"['AM-14-750-016/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference in HTLV-I infection rate for the children in the two groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.01 by chi-square). Furthermore, 2 of 4 elder siblings in the former group developed HTLV-I infection, whereas only one of 8 elder siblings in the latter group became infected. The overall rate of HTLV-I infection of breast-fed children born to HTLV-I-carrier mothers was 25% (8/32) by 3 years of age. Five of 6 mothers with HTLV-I-infected cells in the milk also possessed infected cells in their peripheral blood. Conversely 5 of 6 mothers without infected cells in the peripheral blood possessed no infected cells in their breast milk, suggesting that HTLV-I-infected cells in the peripheral blood can enter the breast milk. None of the 8 breast-fed children born to carrier mothers whose peripheral blood and breast milk-borne cells were negative, developed HTLV-I infection, suggesting that HTLV-I transmission from mother to child is dependent upon the number of HTLV-I-infected cells in carrier mothers.","['Kinoshita, K', 'Amagasaki, T', 'Hino, S', 'Doi, H', 'Yamanouchi, K', 'Ban, N', 'Momita, S', 'Ikeda, S', 'Kamihira, S', 'Ichimaru, M']","['Kinoshita K', 'Amagasaki T', 'Hino S', 'Doi H', 'Yamanouchi K', 'Ban N', 'Momita S', 'Ikeda S', 'Kamihira S', 'Ichimaru M', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['Adult', '*Carrier State', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/blood/*transmission', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Milk, Human/*microbiology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987 Jul;78(7):674-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group with no history of transfusion was younger at onset of HAM (33 [SD 18] yrs. vs 49 [12] yrs.; p less than 0.05). From the latter, we have also recognized another subgroup consisting of 6 young cases (under 15 yrs.) whose mothers were positive for HTLV-I antibody titer. This group has been labeled mother-to-child or vertical transmission. Notably, the progression of symptoms was slower in the vertically transmitted group when compared to the group with a history of transfusion. We also reported the effectiveness of corticosteroids in 4 HAM cases and from the present data, 65 cases have been followed up for treatment response. Based on a 14-grade disability scoring, excellent response was noted in 20%, good in 37%, fair in 34% and no response in 9% of the total 65 cases.

On the allelically excluded chromosome, 25% of the IgG or IgA tumors have retained C mu, and 75% have deleted C mu. The 5' recombination breakpoints for both productive and excluded alleles lie within or near S mu, 3' of the enhancer. No correlation between the extent of allelically excluded CH deletions and the isotype produced by the tumor was observed. Excluded chromosome deletion endpoints were found 5', equal to, or 3' of productive chromosome deletion endpoints. Furthermore, we have identified at least one IgM+ tumor that has undergone abortive CH gene deletions and have observed several unanticipated switch region deletions and potential translocations.

The study shows that the response to tobramycin and latamoxef is comparable to other broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens and that a reduction in the dose of latamoxef after 48 h treatment may safely permit cost savings.","['Rhodes, E G', 'Harris, R I', 'Welch, R S', 'Perry, D J', 'Brown, R M', 'Boughton, B J']","['Rhodes EG', 'Harris RI', 'Welch RS', 'Perry DJ', 'Brown RM', 'Boughton BJ']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Hosp Infect,The Journal of hospital infection,8007166,"['VUF6C936Z3 (Moxalactam)', 'VZ8RRZ51VK (Tobramycin)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Moxalactam/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Random Allocation', 'Tobramycin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0195-6701(87)90125-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0195-6701(87)90125-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hosp Infect. 1987 May;9(3):278-84. doi: 10.1016/0195-6701(87)90125-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cloned 1330-base pair fragment of mouse repetitive DNA (pFS-13) was used as a probe in Southern blotting experiments. Mouse spleen and L1210 lymphoma DNA appeared to be normally methylated at HpaII sites probed by this sequence. Friend erythroleukemia cell, and Sp2 cell DNA both showed an abnormal banding pattern in HpaII digests. Hybridization in situ to metaphase chromosomes showed that probed sequences were broadly interspersed along the arms of each mouse chromosome. The DNA sequence of the 1330-base pair insert in the clone was determined; a copy of the R sequence of L1 was found at its 5' end. Walking experiments using M13 subclones from pFS-13 permitted the construction of a map for d(pCCGG) sites at the 3' end of the mouse L1 family. The unmethylated d(pCCGG) sites in Sp2 and Friend cells could then be assigned to polymorphic-repeated sequence groups within L1, homologous to the region spanned by BAM5 and R. Since there are several thousand copies of each of the fragments seen in autoradiographs, these sequences must possess a common methylation state at many genomic locations. Concerted (nonrandom) hypomethylation of certain subfamilies of L1 appears to be a stable characteristic of several cell lineages. These findings suggest that certain L1 families possess commonalities that permit and perhaps require differential DNA methylation in established cell lineages.","['Tolberg, M E', 'Funderburk, S J', 'Klisak, I', 'Smith, S S']","['Tolberg ME', 'Funderburk SJ', 'Klisak I', 'Smith SS']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes/analysis', 'DNA/analysis/*metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen/analysis']",1987/08/15 00:00,1987/08/15 00:01,['1987/08/15 00:00'],"['1987/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)60940-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 15;262(23):11167-75.,['GM32863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['GENBANK/J02793'],,,,,,,,,,

Colonies of about 200 cells can be clearly distinguished from background aggregates within four to six days after cocultivation. These colonies gradually increase in size and reach 300 to 1,000 cells within 14 days after cocultivation. Cells of these colonies were infected, as evidenced by expression of viral p19 antigen and the presence of HTLV proviral sequences. These cells proved to be transformed in terms of IL-2-independent continuous growth in liquid medium.

Using either indirect immunofluorescent staining or immunoblot analysis P-glycoprotein could not be detected in HL60 cells isolated for resistance to adriamycin. In contrast HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine contain the P-glycoprotein and the amount of this material increases with increasing levels of resistance. These studies thus demonstrate adriamycin resistance in P-glycoprotein negative HL60 cells.

These findings demonstrate a new mechanism for acquisition of oncogenic properties by genes encoding growth factor receptor-like proteins and provide a functional basis for the role of their overexpression in the development of human malignancies.","['Di Fiore, P P', 'Pierce, J H', 'Kraus, M H', 'Segatto, O', 'King, C R', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Di Fiore PP', 'Pierce JH', 'Kraus MH', 'Segatto O', 'King CR', 'Aaronson SA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/07/10 00:00,1987/07/10 00:01,['1987/07/10 00:00'],"['1987/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2885917 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1987 Jul 10;237(4811):178-82. doi: 10.1126/science.2885917.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular control of normal and leukaemic granulocytes and macrophages.",389-423,"The development of semisolid culture methods supporting the clonal proliferation and maturation of granulocytes and macrophages led to the discovery of a group of specific glycoproteins, the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), whose function it is to control the proliferation and functional activity of granulocytes, macrophages and associated blood cells. The four known CSFs in the mouse and man have been purified and complementary DNAs (cDNAs) for each have been cloned. The injection of bacterially synthesized recombinant CSF into mice has demonstrated that these CSFs can function in vivo to regulate granulocyte and macrophage formation. A major physiological role played by these CSFs is to control resistance to invading microorganisms through mechanisms capable of extremely rapid activation. Because the CSFs are the only known proliferative factors for these cells, the CSFs are involved in the initiation and the emergence of myeloid leukaemia but, conversely, at least one of the CSFs, G-CSF, is able to suppress myeloid leukaemic populations because of the ability of the CSFs to initiate differentiation commitment in responding granulocytic and macrophage populations. The CSFs are promising agents for clinical use in the treatment of infections in patients with depressed granulocyte-macrophage formation and possibly in the management of some types of myeloid leukaemia.","['Metcalf, D']",['Metcalf D'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Hybrids containing the human 10q+ chromosome had the human genes for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase that has been mapped at 10q23-q25 and for C alpha [the constant region of TCRA (the alpha-chain locus of the T-cell antigen receptor gene)], but not for V alpha (the variable region of TCRA). Hybrids containing the human 14q- chromosome retained the V alpha genes. Thus the 14q11 breakpoint in the t(10;14) chromosome translocation directly involves TCRA, splitting the locus in a region between the V alpha and the C alpha genes. These results suggest that the translocation of the C alpha locus to a putative cellular protooncogene located proximal to the breakpoint at 10q24, for which we propose the name TCL3, results in its deregulation, leading to T-cell leukemia. Since hybrids with the 10q+ chromosome also retained the human terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene, it is further concluded that the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase locus is proximal to the TCL3 gene, at band 10q23-q24.","['Kagan, J', 'Finan, J', 'Letofsky, J', 'Besa, E C', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Kagan J', 'Finan J', 'Letofsky J', 'Besa EC', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.13.4543 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jul;84(13):4543-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.13.4543.,"['CA 25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC305126,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CLL, the results (range 19-173, mean 64.3 pmol/h/10(6) cells) were comparable to those of normal tonsillar B lymphocytes.

In this study we attempt to determine whether different T-cell subsets exhibit differences in susceptibility to virus infection. T cells from cord or peripheral blood were separated according to cell densities and T-cell surface markers by Percoll gradient and Sepharose anti-Fab immunoadsorbent affinity column (IAC), respectively. Separated T-cell subpopulations were infected with HTLV-I, by means of co-cultivation with irradiated virus producer cell lines (MT-2, TK). Percentages of HTLV-I-infected cells were assayed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), using highly specific mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against HTLV-I p19 core protein. The results showed that different T-cell subpopulations separated either by Percoll or by IAC were susceptible to HTLV-I infection with the exception of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), which exhibit high cell-mediated natural cytotoxicity (CMNC). The susceptibility to HTLV-I infection of T cells with CMNC activity was further studied on established cell clones with LGL morphology.

The present studies indicate that different T-cell subpopulations, irrespective of their size and of cell-surface markers, are susceptible to HTLV-I infection, with the exception of functionally mature LGL or of immortalized LGL clones.","['Macchi, B', 'Popovic, M', 'Allavena, P', 'Ortaldo, J', 'Rossi, P', 'Gallo, R C', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Macchi B', 'Popovic M', 'Allavena P', 'Ortaldo J', 'Rossi P', 'Gallo RC', 'Bonmassar E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910400102 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1987 Jul 15;40(1):1-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910400102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results or preliminary linkage analyses suggested further that the cluster might be linked to Ly-11 on the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 2. Using molecular probes to examine somatic cell lines and recombinant inbred and congenic strains of mice, we have re-evaluated these linkage relationships. A cloned genomic DNA fragment derived from a retroviral site has been used to define a novel locus, Pol-5, that is tightly linked to both H-30 and Ril-1 as shown by analysis of the B6.C-H-30c congenic mouse strain. Following the segregation of the Pol-5 mouse-specific DNA fragment in a series of somatic cell hybrids carrying various combinations of mouse chromosomes on a rat or Chinese hamster background mapped Pol-5 to mouse chromosome 15. During the course of these studies, restriction fragment length polymorphisms were defined associated with several loci, including Pol-5, Ly-6, Sis, Ins-3, Krt-1, Int-1, and Gdc-1. Three of these loci, Sis, Int-1, and Gdc-1, have been previously mapped to chromosome 15 by others using somatic cell hybrids or isoenzyme analyses. Following the inheritance of these eight loci in recombinant inbred strains of mice allowed the definition of a linkage group on the chromosome with the order Ly-6--Ril-1--Sis--H-30--Pol-5--Ins-3--Krt-1--Int-1--Gdc-1. Analyses of alleles inherited as passengers in B6.C-H-30c, C3H.B-Ly-6b, and C57BL/6By-Eh/+ congenic mouse strains and in situ hybridization experiments support the above gene order and indicate further that the cluster is located on distal chromosome 15, with Ly-6 and Sis near Eh.","['Meruelo, D', 'Rossomando, A', 'Scandalis, S', ""D'Eustachio, P"", 'Fournier, R E', 'Roop, D R', 'Saxe, D', 'Blatt, C', 'Nesbitt, M N']","['Meruelo D', 'Rossomando A', 'Scandalis S', ""D'Eustachio P"", 'Fournier RE', 'Roop DR', 'Saxe D', 'Blatt C', 'Nesbitt MN']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hybrid Cells/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Rats']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00396102 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1987;25(6):361-72. doi: 10.1007/BF00396102.,"['CA2247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimate that more than 300 patients a year have been detected in the endemic areas of Kyushu, Japan. The surface phenotype of ATL cells characterized by monoclonal antibodies is T3+, T4+, T8-, T11+ and Tac+. In all cases the serum is positive for anti-HTLV-I antibodies and the ATL cells contain the proviral DNA of HTLV-I. Variations in the clinical features of atypical ATL suggested a division of the spectrum of ATL into five types: acute; chronic; smoldering; crisis; and lymphoma. Typical ATL takes an acute course. The survival time is short, with 50% mortality within approximately 5 months. In general a poor prognosis is indicated by the elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, and bilirubin, as well as by high WBC. Smoldering ATL is characterized by the presence of a few abnormal cells (0.5%-3%) in the peripheral blood over a long period. Crisis in chronic or smoldering ATL means the progression of the disease to acute ATL. The lymphoma type of ATL is considered to be a form of T-cell-type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in which malignant cells contain proviral DNA of HTLV-I. Screening of the sera from healthy adults for presence of the anti-HTLV-I antibodies revealed that 3.6% of healthy individuals in Kumamoto Prefecture, which is located in the middle of Kyushu, were HTLV-I carriers. Family studies showed that the routes of natural infection of HTLV-I are from mother to child and also from husband to wife. The borderline between the healthy carrier state and smoldering ATL remains unclear. Smoldering ATL is frequently diagnosed in patients with fungus infection of the skin, chronic lymphadenopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, chronic renal failure and strongyloidiasis. Five patients with ATL refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic agents were treated with 2'-deoxy-coformycin (DCF), a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. Two patients showed a good response, and three were resistant to DCF. In addition our experiences with a concurrence of lymphoma-type ATL in three sisters and spontaneous remissions in a patients with chronic ATL will be referred.","['Takatsuki, K']",['Takatsuki K'],,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

It was then used to determine the locations of the myeloperoxidase light and heavy chains in the polypeptide precursor. A cDNA library from poly(A)+ RNA from human leukemia HL-60 cells was constructed in pBR322 and screened by differential hybridization with enriched and depleted cDNA probes and then by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe. A cDNA clone containing 1278 bp with an open reading frame of 474 bp and a 3' noncoding region of 804 bp was isolated. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence consisted of 158 residues including a sequence of 14 amino acids known to be present in the heavy chain of the molecule. The cDNA also included a stop codon of TAG followed by a noncoding sequence that included a potential recognition site for polyadenylylation and a poly(A) tail. RNA transfer blot analysis with the cDNA probe indicated that myeloperoxidase mRNA was approximately 3.3 kb in length. In vitro translation of the mRNA selected by cDNA hybridization revealed preferential synthesis of a 74,000-Da polypeptide precursor that could be precipitated with anti-myeloperoxidase IgG. Antibodies specific for the heavy and light chains of myeloperoxidase were isolated from antiserum by affinity chromatography employing Sepharose columns covalently bound to the heavy or light chains.

Besmer, W.D. Hardy,Jr., E. E. Zuckerman, P. J. Bergold, L. Lederman, and H. W. Snyder, Jr. (1983) Nature (London) 303, 825-828). In contrast to A-MuLV which was isolated from a hematopoietic tumor, the HZ2-FeSV derives from a multicentric fibrosarcoma. We have molecularly cloned the HZ2-FeSV provirus from mink HZ2-FeSV nonproducer cells. The molecularly cloned HZ2-FeSV provirus is biologically active upon transfection of NIH 3T3 indicator cells. The genetic structure of the HZ2-FeSV provirus was determined by EM heteroduplex and Southern blot analysis. The HZ2-FeSV has a 6.8 kb-viral genome with the structure: 5' delta gag-abl-delta pol-delta env 3'. The abl insert, which is 1.4 kb, is located 1.9 kb from the 5' end and 3.5 kb from the 3' end of the viral genome. The 5' 1.9 kb in the HZ2-FeSV are colinear with 5' FeLV sequences, and the 3' 3.5 kb are colinear with 3' FeLV sequences, with the exception of a 0.85-kb deletion in the env gene. HZ2-FeSV v-abl and A-MuLV v-abl share 1.2 kb of abl sequences which are known to specify the protein kinase domain of the abl gene product and are necessary for fibroblast transformation in vitro. The DNA from several tumor tissues of cat 3590 from which the HZ2-FeSV was obtained was found to contain several HZ2-FeSV-related proviruses including the HZ2-FeSV. The variant HZ2-FeSVs have indistinguishable 5' gag-abl sequences; however, they differ in 3' sequences which likely do not include any abl sequences. The DNAs from fibrosarcomas obtained by inoculation of kittens with tumor extract were found to contain variant HZ2-FeSV proviruses as well. Taken together these results indicate a role for the HZ2-FeSVs in sarcomagenesis.","['Bergold, P J', 'Wang, J Y', 'Hardy, W D Jr', 'Littau, V', 'Johnson, E', 'Besmer, P']","['Bergold PJ', 'Wang JY', 'Hardy WD Jr', 'Littau V', 'Johnson E', 'Besmer P']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fibrosarcoma/*microbiology/pathology/veterinary', 'Genes, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1987/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(87)90204-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1987 Jun;158(2):320-9. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90204-2.,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine prevention of virus-induced human cancers.",147-61,"Carcinogenic viruses have been discovered in numerous animal species over the last 80 years but their role in human cancer has only recently become an important issue. With EB virus involved with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, hepatitis B virus with primary liver cancer, papilloma viruses with carcinoma of the cervix, and T-cell leukaemia virus with adult T leukaemia, 20-25% of all human cancer appears to have a virus component in its causation. By analogy with certain virus-induced animal cancers, vaccine prevention of infection should greatly reduce subsequent tumour development; vaccines against hepatitis B virus are already on trial for this purpose in populations at risk. Experiments are described in which an EB virus subunit vaccine consisting of the virus-determined membrane antigen glycoprotein molecule of molecular mass 340 kDa (MA gp340) has been prepared by two purification methods. Material from one of these has successfully protected cotton-top tamarins against a 100% lymphomagenic dose of challenge virus and investigations are under way to identify an immunogen, based on MA gp340, suitable for use in man. Genetically engineered bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells expressing the gp340 gene are already available; this gene has also been inserted into vaccinia and varicella virus vectors. Powerful new adjuvants are also considered, together with future strategies for human vaccine studies.","['Epstein, M A']",['Epstein MA'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Pharm. 31:121). In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism by which resistant tumor cells maintain their increased GSH content, we have assessed the possible role of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), a membrane bound enzyme involved in GSH metabolism. These results indicate that the enzyme is present in both sensitive and resistant murine L1210 leukemia cells but that the cellular content of gamma-GT is elevated two-to threefold in L-PAM resistant cells as compared to their sensitive counterparts. This elevation in enzymatic activity correlates well with the increased cellular GSH content in resistant cells. The results of a detailed kinetic analysis of gamma-GT activity indicate that there is no difference, between cell types, in the apparent Km of the enzyme for the gamma-glutamyl donor (L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide) or the acceptor (glycylglycine). However, the apparent Vmax is increased two-to threefold in L-PAM resistant tumor cells. Investigation into the role of gamma-GT in the extracellular metabolism of GSH indicates that resistant tumor cells metabolize two-fold more GSH than do sensitive cells and that such metabolism results in a similar difference in the intracellular concentration of cysteine. Results of studies with cellular lysates also indicate a role for the enzyme in the supply of cysteine to the glutathione precursor pool of the tumor cell and in the maintenance of elevated GSH concentrations in cells resistant to alkylating agents.","['Ahmad, S', 'Okine, L', 'Wood, R', 'Aljian, J', 'Vistica, D T']","['Ahmad S', 'Okine L', 'Wood R', 'Aljian J', 'Vistica DT']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'M04OVR7C8R (anthglutin)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/*metabolism']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041310214 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 May;131(2):240-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310214.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytopathic effect was preceded by the expression of HIV antigen, defined with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the core protein (p24) of HIV. SKT-1B is highly susceptible to HIV as compared with MT-2 and H9 cells. HIV is known to be transmitted via blood products, and thus we examined whether or not currently used procedures for manufacturing blood products are safe by using SKT-1B. Lyophilized HIV was heated at 65 degrees for time periods in the range of 10 min to 48 hr, and the infectivity was examined. The results showed that heating at 65 degrees for less than 2 hr was not sufficient to inactivate HIV, but the virus heated for 48 hr had no effect on SKT-1B. In addition, HIV completely lost its infectivity on sulfonation, which is commonly used to avoid anaphylactic shock on intravenous infusion of human immunoglobulins. These findings indicate that blood products manufactured by currently used procedures are probably safe with respect to HIV infection.","['Koito, A', 'Shirono, K', 'Suto, H', 'Matsushita, S', 'Hattori, T', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Koito A', 'Shirono K', 'Suto H', 'Matsushita S', 'Hattori T', 'Takatsuki K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blood Proteins/*standards', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/microbiology/pathology', 'HIV/*analysis/growth & development', 'Humans']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987 Apr;78(4):365-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ratios between the areas of the nucleus and whole cell profile (nucleus/cell ratio), heterochromatin and euchromatin, the nucleolus and nucleus, and the degree of irregularity of the nucleus were compared between the two major types of leukemia studied. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells had a relatively larger nucleus and relatively less cytoplasm than acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, and a greater proportion of the area of the nucleus was occupied by heterochromatin in ALL cells than in AML cells. According to the FAB classification, L1 cells are characterized by narrow, and L2 cells by wide cytoplasm based on light microscopic observation of smeared cells, and we confirmed these features by morphometry of May-Giemsa-stained blood smears. However, by electron microscopy there was no difference in the nucleus/cell ratio between L1 and L2 cells, this constituting a discrepancy between the results obtained by electron and light microscopic morphometry. In addition there was no difference in the degree of nuclear irregularity between L1 and L2 cells. Among AML subtypes, significant differences were observed only in the nucleus/cell ratio between M3 and M1, M2 or M4 cells, and in the heterochromatin/euchromatin ratio between M5 and M1, M2 or M3 cells. In conclusion, electron microscopic morphometry revealed marked differences between ALL and AML, but the differences among their subtypes defined by the FAB classification based on nonmorphometric light microscopy were less evident by electron microscopic morphometry.","['Ochiai, F', 'Eguchi, M']","['Ochiai F', 'Eguchi M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

MPO-deficient PMN were characterized by a decreased size of the total cell (P less than 0.01), an increased size of the nucleus (P less than 0.01) and a decreased size of the cytoplasm (P less than 0.01). The resulting highly increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio in this specific PMN subpopulation bears a striking resemblance to cells in malignant tumours.

An attempt was made to determine whether the cells from patients with this leukemia were HTLV-I antigen-committed B cells that had undergone malignant transformation. Cells from two HTLV-I seropositive Jamaican patients with CLL were fused with a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line. The hybridoma cells that resulted from the fusion of CLL cells from patient I.C. produced an immunoglobulin (IgM) that reacted with the p24 gag protein from HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III (now referred to as HIV), but showed preferential reactivity with HTLV-I. The specific immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (IgM, kappa) in the CLL cell was demonstrated in the hybridoma cell line, indicating that the captured immunoglobulin was from the CLL cells. The IgM secreted by the fusion of CLL cells from patient L.L. reacted only with HTLV-I-infected cells and with the HTLV-I large envelope protein (gp61) on Western blots.

The leukemic cells were classified into four groups, as follows. Group 1 (two patients): Cells of this group produced IL 2 messenger RNA, secreted IL 2, and proliferated when cultured in mitogen-free medium. The spontaneous proliferation of the cells in mitogen-free medium was inhibited by anti-Tac/IL 2 receptor and anti-IL 2 monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, the thymidine incorporation by the cells was enhanced in response to exogeneously added recombinant IL 2 and IL 2 produced by themselves. These results indicate that the ATL cells of this group proliferate with autostimulation by IL 2. Group 2 (seven patients): Cells of this group did not secrete IL 2 when cultured in mitogen-free medium, but the cells showed response to exogeneously added recombinant IL 2 and proliferated in culture. These results indicate that the ATL cells of this group proliferate by a paracrine mechanism. Group 3 (one patient): Cells of this group secreted IL 2 in mitogen-free medium. However, the spontaneous proliferation of these cells in vitro was very low, and the response to recombinant IL 2 was also very low. Group 4 (three patients): Cells of this group did not secrete IL 2 in mitogen-free medium. Spontaneous proliferation and the response to recombinant IL 2 were also very low. The clinical feature of all patients of Groups 1 and 2 was acute-type, and that of Groups 3 and 4 was chronic-type. Thus, we conclude that heterogeneous mechanisms exist in the proliferation of leukemic cells, and that growth rate in mitogen-free medium and response to IL 2 of the cells may have a significant relationship to the clinical feature, acute- or chronic-type.","['Arima, N', 'Daitoku, Y', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Fujimoto, K', 'Ohgaki, S', 'Kojima, K', 'Fukumori, J', 'Matsushita, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'Onoue, K']","['Arima N', 'Daitoku Y', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Fujimoto K', 'Ohgaki S', 'Kojima K', 'Fukumori J', 'Matsushita K', 'Tanaka H', 'Onoue K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/classification/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 May 1;138(9):3069-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL cell lines such as Hut-102, MT-1, and MT-2 functioned as accessory cells for the stimulation of human T cell proliferative response induced with concanavalin A (Con A) and induced allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Cell lysates of three ATL cell lines and the culture supernatant of MT-2 cells had activities to stimulate murine thymocyte proliferative response. Then we studied physicochemical properties of the factors produced by MT-2 cells. The m.w. of the factors were approximately 15,000 by Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography, and their isoelectric point values were 5.4 and 4.8 by chromatofocussing technique. No fraction contained interleukin 2 (IL 2) activities to stimulate IL 2-dependent murine cytotoxic T cell line. The thymocyte-stimulating activities of the factors were absorbed with rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha antiserum, but not with anti-IL 1 beta antiserum. Furthermore, messenger RNA extracted from MT-2 cells hybridized to complementary DNA of IL 1 alpha, but not of IL 1 beta, by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The factors from MT-2 cells could stimulate the production of IL 2 and the expression of IL 2 receptors of human T cells in the presence of Con A as well as recombinant IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta did, and these activities were also blocked by rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha antiserum, but not by anti-IL 1 beta antiserum. These results suggest that the factors produced by MT-2 cells correspond to IL 1 alpha. However, the accessory function of MT-2 cells for T cell activation was not blocked by rabbit anti-IL 1 antiserum. These results suggest that ATL cell lines produce IL 1-like factors, but the accessory function of ATL cell lines for T cell activation is mediated by some other mechanisms rather than by secreted IL 1-like factors.","['Yamashita, U', 'Shirakawa, F', 'Nakamura, H']","['Yamashita U', 'Shirakawa F', 'Nakamura H']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects']",1987/05/15 00:00,1987/05/15 00:01,['1987/05/15 00:00'],"['1987/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 May 15;138(10):3284-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous stem cell rescue using blood cells collected during this phase has shown that successful hemopoietic reconstitution can be achieved, but a higher CFU-GM dose appears to be required than when bone marrow cells are used. This suggests that during very early remission, the level of marrow repopulating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) in blood does not undergo the same amount of increase as does the CFU-GM. This study set out to determine whether the levels of the multilineage progenitor cell (CFU-Mix) would be better indicators of the PSC in these cells than the CFU-GM. Serial peripheral blood CFU-Mix and CFU-GM measurements were carried out in six ANLL patients during very early remission. The levels of peripheral blood CFU-Mix showed a mean 12-fold increase, as compared to a mean 20-fold increase in the CFU-GM. The timing of the increase in the CFU-Mix paralleled that of the CFU-GM.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of an HTLV-I provirus by Seiki et al [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1982: 6899-902] has revealed a distinct region of the genome located between env and the long terminal repeat sequences (LTR). Analysis of a variant of HTLV-I, called HTLV-Ib, which retains transforming ability, revealed a deletion in the 5' portion of this sequence that indicates that this portion of the sequence probably does not play an essential role in transformation. Hybridizations at varying stringencies show that at least a portion of this additional region of HTLV-I and -II is more highly conserved than most other regions of the genome. The DNA sequence of this HTLV-II region localizes the area of homology within the 1,000 base pairs just upstream of the LTR; the remainder of the region is not conserved. The conserved region includes a long open reading frame, is denoted lor, and has the coding capacity for a protein of at least 38 kilodaltons (kd). Studies of the transcriptional activity of the LTR sequences show that the rate of LTR-directed transcription is greatly augmented in HTLV-infected cells, a phenomenon called trans-acting transcriptional regulation. It is suggested that transformation of lymphocytes by HTLV-I or -II is mediated by action of HTLV-encoded trans-acting transcription factors on cellular genes that control the replication of lymphocytes.","['Ratner, L', 'Sodroski, J G', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Haseltine, W A', 'Shaw, G M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Ratner L', 'Sodroski JG', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Haseltine WA', 'Shaw GM', 'Gallo RC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1987;10(5-6):411-24.,['CA 36974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,83,,,,,,,,

Structural abnormalities of chromosome 3 were the most common. In one case a complete loss of the short arm of chromosome 10 (10 p-) was noted while in another case a balanced translocation involving chromosome 10p and 4q was found. These abnormalities have not been previously reported. After reviewing the literature, it was concluded that chromosomes 3, 6, 10, 13, 14, and X were most frequently involved in abnormalities. Specific and consistent chromosomal abnormalities were noted in each study. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the mutation rate for this virus may be higher than first expected. Furthermore, the relative consistency of heterogeneous findings in different localities may reflect a geographic clustering of specific chromosomal abnormalities which may in turn be related to specific and geographically associated viral mutations. To support these suggestions not only are more cytogenetic data required but a molecular evaluation of these patients must be carried out to establish a relationship, if any, between genetic abnormalities and the epidemiology of ATL.","['Verma, R S', 'Macera, M J', 'Krishnamurthy, M', 'Abramson, J', 'Kapelner, S', 'Dosik, H']","['Verma RS', 'Macera MJ', 'Krishnamurthy M', 'Abramson J', 'Kapelner S', 'Dosik H']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00391443 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1987;113(2):192-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00391443.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plasmid vector, pWS50, utilizes the very strong and easily regulated bacteriophage lambda promoter pL, and the efficient translation initiation signals of the N-terminal segment of the lambda cII gene. Fused distally to and out of translational phase with cII is the E. coli lacZ gene, lacking its own transcriptional and translational initiating signals. A unique restriction enzyme site (NruI) is located between the upstream regulatory sequences and the lacZ gene, which provides a cloning site for the insertion of blunt ended DNA fragments. In addition, there are two other unique restriction sites (NheI and BamHI) located in this region which can also be used as closing sites. If a DNA fragment does not contain any translation termination codons (i.e., an ORF), and is inserted correctly into the vector, the translational reading frame between cII and lacZ can be restored. Colonies containing these recombinants can be easily screened as LacZ+ on lactose indicator media. The beta-galactosidase fusion proteins produced from the LacZ+ recombinants are identified on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels by their large size and high level of production. To test the ORF cloning-expression system, a segment of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I envelope gene was cloned and expressed at high levels.

Clinical descriptions by Burkitt and Takatsuki led to discovery of these viruses which infect silently early in life; however, ATLV is also transmitted to a spouse or by blood transfusion. In normal seropositive persons both viruses infect only 1 in about 10,000 B or T cells, respectively. EBV is associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and infectious mononucleosis. ATLV is associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and smoldering T cell lymphoma. EBV infects polyclonally and is controlled by multiple cellular and humoral control mechanisms. Escape from immune surveillance as in immune deficient African children with malaria, males with x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, organ transplant recipients, and AIDS patients permits conversion from polyclonal to oligoclonal and finally, monoclonal malignancy. T cell immune defects permit proliferation of cells which undergo molecular and/or cytogenetic alterations. In contrast to EBV, which is integrated and nonintegrated in B cells, ATLV is monoclonally integrated. Viral transforming proteins and immune suppressive substances are produced. Immune deficiency in silent carriers of ATLV and in those with smoldering ATL suggest that immune surveillance deters emergence of ATL. Prevention of primary infection by vaccination against these lymphotropic viruses, and use of immunotherapy and antiviral drugs may potentially retard conversion of infected B or T cells to monoclonal malignancy.","['Purtilo, D T']",['Purtilo DT'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AIDS Res,AIDS research,8310361,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Deltaretrovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*complications/immunology', 'HIV/pathogenicity', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/immunology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,AIDS Res. 1986 Dec;2 Suppl 1:S1-6.,,,,,,,39,,,,,,,,

We used the pyrazolosteroid [3H]cortivazol ([3H]CVZ) to determine whether ICR 27 cells actually contain glucocorticoid receptors and, if so, whether these receptors can mediate physiological effects. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]CVZ to cytosol from ICR 27 cells was consistent with a single class of receptors of uniform affinity (0.7 nM). Cytosolic [3H]CVZ complexes had a sedimentation coefficient of 4.6S on linear sucrose gradients and eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns at a potassium phosphate concentration of 250 mM. CVZ also competed with [3H]DEX mesylate for binding to a 96,000 mol wt protein. Incubation of ICR 27 cells with CVZ caused 50% growth inhibition and 50% maximal induction of glutamine synthetase activity at concentrations of 20 and 35 nM, respectively. Elution profiles of [3H]CVZ complexes from DEAE-cellulose columns showed that complexes formed upon thermal activation were relatively unstable, and little or no increase in binding of [3H]CVZ-receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose was observed. Thus, [3H]CVZ identifies functional glucocorticoid receptors in a cell line previously described as DEX resistant. Although the binding of [3H]CVZ to activated receptors in vitro appears unstable, high concentrations of CVZ may facilitate stabilization of activated complexes that can mediate both anabolic and catabolic effects.","['Schlechte, J A', 'Schmidt, T J']","['Schlechte JA', 'Schmidt TJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'YM183K0H63 (cortivazol)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/biosynthesis', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Pregnatrienes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem-64-3-441 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1987 Mar;64(3):441-6. doi: 10.1210/jcem-64-3-441.,"['MH-34714/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients achieved partial remission by IFN-beta administration with a response duration of 1, 1.5, and 12 months respectively, whereas one complete remission and two partial responses were experienced by IFN-gamma treatment with 4, 4, and 2 months of response.

The mean Z-score was 0.16 at diagnosis, -0.30 2 years later, -0.71 4 years later, and -1.37 6 years later. Height for age had fallen by more than 1 standard deviation of the population mean in 32% of survivors 4 years after diagnosis and in 71% 6 years after diagnosis.

Important common features of these viruses are: transmission by sexual contact or blood, tropism for the T4-lymphocyte and the effects of a viral transactivating gene (tat). They differ in their pathogenic effects, HTLV-I and -II being associated with lymphoproliferative malignancies, while HTLV-III is cytopathic and associated with immunosuppression. HTLV-IV is, apparently, not directly highly pathogenic for man. An African origin for this family of viruses is suggested by recent isolations of similar (STLV-I and -III) viruses in Old World primates. Prospects for the possible development of a cross-reactive vaccine have increased since the demonstration of highly conserved DNA sequences in the envelope region of several divergent HTLV-III strains.","['Gallo, R C']",['Gallo RC'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', '*Deltaretrovirus', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02935003 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1986;3(3-4):265-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02935003.,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,

In 19 of 23 infants examined, the ATLV-positive cells were detected at 9 to 36 months after birth. The titers of antibodies to ATLV in the pairs of samples from mothers and their infants at birth were virtually equal, as expected. After birth, the titer of maternally derived antibody in all infants decreased gradually, and it disappeared within 3 to 9 months. However, ATLV-antibody reappeared in 12 of 24 infants examined, being detected after 12 months old.

At concentrations of 0.05-20 microM, vinblastine, vincristine, and maytansine similarly increased the steady-state cell concentration of VP-16 (2.5 microM) up to 2-fold. Following removal of extracellular vinblastine, the elevation of cell VP-16 was maintained through an additional 55-min incubation period. Washing cells free of extracellular VP-16 resulted in a nonexchangeable (or bound) component comprising 15-17% of the VP-16 concentration found before removal of extracellular drug. In cells incubated with VP-16 alone, removal of extracellular drug resulted in less than 5% cell retention of drug. At vinblastine concentrations of 0.05-0.2 microM, the increase in cell VP-16 was due to a progressive increase in nonexchangeable VP-16. At greater vinblastine concentrations, up to 10 microM, there was no further increase in nonexchangeable VP-16 but there was a 1.6-fold increase in the exchangeable (or free) concentration of VP-16. Similar elevation of both nonexchangeable and exchangeable VP-16 by 10 microM vincristine and maytansine was observed; however, 50-100 microM podophyllotoxin or taxol was required for comparable elevation of exchangeable drug with no increase of nonexchangeable VP-16. Elevation of exchangeable VP-16 in the presence of vinblastine was due to inhibition of the unidirectional efflux of this epipodophyllotoxin with a 69% decline in the rate constant for efflux. There were no effects of vinblastine on VP-16 influx. There was no enhancement of DNA single-strand break frequency when cells were incubated with 2.5 microM VP-16 and 0.2 microM vinblastine, a concentration of the Vinca alkaloid that increased only nonexchangeable VP-16. VP-16-induced DNA damage was enhanced by vinblastine concentrations above 0.5 microM, concentrations that elevated exchangeable VP-16, with a maximum doubling of radiation equivalent single-strand break frequency observed with 20 microM vinblastine, consistent with the maximum elevation of cell VP-16 with 20 microM Vinca alkaloid. These results indicate that vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors elevate cell VP-16 by inhibition of the efflux of exchangeable drug and by increasing the level of nonexchangeable drug. Potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage is observed only at microtubule inhibitor concentrations which elevate exchangeable VP-16.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Yalowich, J C']",['Yalowich JC'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '14083FR882 (Maytansine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Maytansine/pharmacology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel', 'Podophyllotoxin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 15;47(4):1010-5.,['RR05584-21/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found that inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of guanylate synthesis from IMP, are potent inducers of HL-60 maturation. Because of these observations we specifically investigated the activity of IMP dehydrogenase in HL-60 cells and in a new inducible human myeloid leukemia cell line, RDFD2-25, both during maintenance culture and during induced maturation of the cells. Enzyme activity was examined directly in cell extracts with a radiometric assay that measures free 3H2O formed from [2-3H] IMP during the conversion of IMP to XMP. Uninduced HL-60 and RDFD2 cells in maintenance culture were found to have high levels of IMPD activity (5.2 to 5.7 pmol IMP metabolized/10(7) cells/min) compared with normal neutrophils and monocytes that had been purified from blood (less than 1.5 pmol IMP metabolized/10(7) cells/min). However, when HL-60 and RDFD2-25 cells were induced to mature with retinoic acid (10(-6) mol/L), dimethylformamide (6 X 10(-2) mol/L), or a known IMPD inhibitor, tiazofurin (10(-6) mol/L), IMPD activity in the cells fell by 51% to 80% within three to six hours. These changes in IMPD activity preceded detectable functional and antigenic maturation of the cells by at least 12 hours and were not temporally related to changes in cellular proliferation. These findings are consistent with the concept that the regulation of myeloid cell maturation may be influenced by intracellular concentrations of guanine ribonucleotides because IMP dehydrogenase activity is known to be rate limiting for the production of these nucleotides.","['Knight, R D', 'Mangum, J', 'Lucas, D L', 'Cooney, D A', 'Khan, E C', 'Wright, D G']","['Knight RD', 'Mangum J', 'Lucas DL', 'Cooney DA', 'Khan EC', 'Wright DG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68910-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Feb;69(2):634-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hepatosplenomegaly was found without skin eruption. The blood examination on admission revealed leukocytosis (50,800/microliter) and atypical lymphocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei. He had hypercalcemia, and hepatic and renal damage. A diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) in the acute stage was made. Treatment with KM2210, a conjugate of chlorambucil and estradiol, was started, and his peripheral leukocytes decreased gradually reaching, 19,700/microliter by the end of this medication. His leukocyte count continued to decrease after discontinuation of KM2210 and reached a nadir of 4,700/microliter. Hepatosplenomegaly and hypercalcemia also improved. About one month later, recurrence of the disease occurred and he was again treated with KM2210. Although the second course of the KM2210 therapy was also successful in relieving hepatosplenomegaly and leukocytosis, it proved impossible to ameliorate his poor condition and he died of DIC.

Most clinical protocols divide these tumors into two broad categories--indolent, or low-grade, and aggressive, or high-grade. Patients with low-grade NHLs usually have a relatively long survival, with or without the use of aggressive therapy. Although the tumors can be controlled with conventional chemotherapeutic approaches, they are rarely cured. Patients with high-grade tumors usually die within 1 to 2 years without therapy. However, with aggressive treatment, many patients can be cured if complete remissions can be sustained for at least 2 years. Several types of NHLs represent distinct clinicopathologic entities--lymphoblastic lymphoma, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, true histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia. Immunologic concepts are now used to classify NHLs. Identifying the cell of origin of a malignant lymphoma has important therapeutic implications, since malignant cells retain phenotypic and functional properties of their precursors. It is possible, therefore, to predict both the sites of involvement and the patterns of dissemination. Clinical applications are beginning to be developed. These include the use of monoclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies coupled to a toxin, alpha interferon, and monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Human leukocyte interferon has been used experimentally to induce spontaneous regressions. Excellent results have been achieved so far only for patients with low-grade lymphomas.","['Jaffe, E S']",['Jaffe ES'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/classification', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(86)90090-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1986 Dec;13(4 Suppl 5):3-9.,,,,,,,48,,,,,,,,

The restriction patterns with PstI ans SstI of most STLV-I proviruses were identical to those of the previous isolate from this species, but in three monkeys there was a deletion of one PstI site.

We showed, furthermore, that inhibitors of the enzyme, inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step of guanylate synthesis from the central intermediate IMP, are potent inducers of myeloid maturation in these cells. We now show that induced maturation of HL-60 cells is prevented or impaired if intracellular concentrations of guanine ribonucleotides are maintained at high levels. HL-60 cells can utilize exogenous guanine and guanosine to maintain GTP and GDP pools through a salvage pathway that bypasses guanylate synthesis from IMP. Moreover, incubation of HL-60 cells with guanosine or guanine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) prevents both the depletion of intracellular guanine ribonucleotides and the induction of myeloid maturation caused by the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, tiazofurin. These findings provide strong additional support for the concept that terminal myeloid differentiation is influenced by a guanine ribonucleotide-dependent regulatory system.","['Wright, D G']",['Wright DG'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*physiology', 'Guanosine/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76585-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):334-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include the hepatitis B virus in hepatocellular carcinoma, human papillomaviruses in cervical cancer, Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and human T-lymphotrophic virus in adult T cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. These pieces of evidence have accumulated from both clinical and basic studies which have shown that these viruses are involved in some stage of the carcinogenic process. Because of the rapid development of techniques and knowledge of molecular biology, most of the gene structures of these viruses and their products have been identified. These results make it possible to understand more clearly the route of infection and have facilitated the production of vaccines, using DNA-recombinant techniques. A significant decrease in the incidence of these types of cancers is expected through prevention programs conducted throughout the general population against these viruses within 10 to 20 years. These virus-related human cancers also provide us with a good opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the development of human cancers in general. In the present paper, these points are stressed in addition to describing the recent progress made in the study on virus-related human cancers.","['Tsunokawa, Y', 'Terada, M']","['Tsunokawa Y', 'Terada M']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

All received the same induction therapy consisting of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine--DAT (1 + 5). The 67% who entered complete remission were randomised to consolidation with two or six further courses of DAT. Adults under the age of 55 were randomised for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate. Finally, those still in remission after 1 year of cytarabine and 6-thioguanine (AT) maintenance were randomised to receive either late intensification with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cytarabine, and prednisolone (COAP) or continued AT. The median survival for the whole group was 12 months; the median duration of first remission was 15 months, with relapse-free survival at 5 years estimated at 18%. The factors most strongly associated with poor survival were performance status and age at presentation, but even among those over 60 years of age, half went into remission. Six courses of DAT consolidation gave a small advantage over two courses in reducing the number of late relapses but no significant survival advantage. Late intensification showed a marginally significant advantage over continued AT maintenance. The incidence of CNS relapse was low and unaffected by prophylaxis. The second remission rate varied from 10% when the first remission was shorter than 6 months to 61% when it had continued for more than 2 years. 40 patients received histocompatible allogeneic bone-marrow transplants in first remission. There was a high procedure-related death rate, particularly among patients over 30 years of age. Thus, initially at least, the transplanted group had shorter survival than a comparable group of chemotherapy-treated patients. Treatment specifications remained unchanged throughout the trial but those enrolled in the later half of the trial had a better (p = 0.003) survival.","['Rees, J K', 'Gray, R G', 'Swirsky, D', 'Hayhoe, F G']","['Rees JK', 'Gray RG', 'Swirsky D', 'Hayhoe FG']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Random Allocation', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1986/11/29 00:00,1986/11/29 00:01,['1986/11/29 00:00'],"['1986/11/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/29 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(86)92674-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(86)92674-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1986 Nov 29;2(8518):1236-41. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(86)92674-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The carrier rates in ages 15-17, 8.7 and 2.1%, were significantly higher than that in ages 6-8, 1.7 and 0.4%, in studies. The latter survey showed a significantly lower carrier rate in each age group. Moreover, the carrier rates of those students born in 1965-1967 and 1968-1970 were stable in the interval. The data suggested that carrier rates of children at certain ages are reflected by the date of birth rather than by age. A prospective survey of children born of carrier mothers found the overall carrier rate to be approximately 25%, which did not increase with their age. There was no sexual difference in the carrier rate of children: 5/25 in male and 9/34 in females (X2 = 0.3). Carrier mothers could be separated into two groups: HTLV-I antigen-positive mothers and negative mothers. Nine out of 19 antigen-positive mothers (47%) and 2 of 19 antigen-negative mothers (11%) had carrier children (X2 = 6.3). Twelve of 30 children born of antigen-positive carrier mothers (40%) were carriers, in contrast to 2 of 24 children (8%) of antigen-negative mothers (X2 = 7.8). Furthermore, 12 of 14 carrier children (86%) were of antigen-positive mothers.

Dexamethasone was found to induce an increase of about 100% in transglutaminase activity in mouse and rat BMDMP. The effect was time- and dose-dependent, and specific for steroids with glucocorticoid activity. Retinoic acid (RA) suppressed transglutaminase activity in mouse BMDMP (approximately 50%) and enhanced it in rat BMDMP (100-200%). Other retinoids were less effective. 1,25(OH)2D3 had little effect on transglutaminase expression in mouse BMDMP and suppressed it in rat BMDMP (approximately 60%). TPA exerted a suppressive effect (approximately 50%) on transglutaminase activity of both rat and mouse BMDMP. In murine (P388D1 and J774.2) and human (ML3, HL-60, KG-1, HEL, U937) myeloid leukemia cell lines, dexamethasone enhanced transglutaminase activity to a varying degree (100-1,000%), RA suppressed it in P388D1 cells (approximately 70%) and enhanced it in the other cell lines (100-1,500%), 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a rather small augmentation of enzyme expression, whereas TPA suppressed enzyme expression (70-100%). The species-specific differences previously observed by us for the effect of RA, dexamethasone and 1,25(OH)2D3 on the formation of BMDMP from mouse and rat bone marrow progenitor cells are now shown to extend also to effects on expression of transglutaminase activity. From a mechanistic point of view it is of interest that dexamethasone uniformly enhanced transglutaminase activity, whereas TPA suppressed it. RA and 1,25(OH)2D3 induced either suppression or enhancement in the various cell types, with no correlation between the direction of the effect of the two agents.

Distinctive characteristics include hypercalcaemia, metabolic bone disease, opportunistic infections and evidence of multiorgan involvement. The malignant cell has the surface phenotype of a T helper lymphocyte but functions as a T suppressor cell, and in leukaemic patients this cell usually has a unique multilobed appearance, which may aid in recognizing the disease. The overwhelming majority of patients with ATLL originate from the south-west Japanese archipelago, as well as the Caribbean basin and south-east USA. The geographic localization of this disease is the result of the endemic distribution of the human retrovirus (HTLV-I) which has been established as the cause of ATLL. Infection with this virus may result in no disease (asymptomatic carriers) or ATLL. While ATLL usually pursues an acute or subacute (prototypic) course, patients are also seen with 'chronic' or 'smouldering' disease. Over time, these more indolent variations may progress to the prototypic form. When aggressive, ATLL must be treated with intense combinations of cytotoxic drugs similar to those used to treat the more common B cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Even though half of the patients treated achieve a remission, the duration is usually brief and the overall actuarial median survival is only 11 months.

Biochemical and pharmacological studies on the degradation of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD).,3783-90,"In order to exert its antitumor effects, the C-nucleoside tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) is converted to the dinucleotide TAD (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide), an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPD). With few exceptions, sensitive tumors (such as the P388 leukemia) have been found to accumulate substantially more of this inhibitory dinucleotide than resistant strains (exemplified by the colon 38 carcinoma). Previous studies have attributed this difference to a depressed capacity to synthesize TAD on the part of tumors refractory to tiazofurin. In the present study, a second contributory factor has been identified, viz. an enhanced ability to degrade preformed TAD. This degradation has been traced to a soluble phosphodiesterase present at high levels in tumors naturally resistant to tiazofurin. Using standard techniques, this TAD-phosphodiesterase has been purified 200-fold from the colon 38 carcinoma. The activity so purified readily hydrolyzed TAD and ADP-ribose, but exhibited a comparatively weak activity toward NAD and thymidine-5'-monophosphate-nitrophenyl ester.

In sample 1, the sex- and age-standardized prevalence of anti-ATLA was 38.5%. This was five times as high as the standardized prevalence in sample 2 (7.8%). There were significant differences in prevalence of anti-ATLA between males in samples 1 and 2 and between females in samples 1 and 2. In every age group, prevalence in sample 1 was greater than that in sample 2 except for males aged 60-69 years. In each of four subareas, families in sample 1 had higher standardized prevalence (29.6-42.5%) than families in sample 2 (6.0-9.7%).

This study was designed to explain an unusual rate of delayed engraftment (50%) in our experience of ABMT in CGL patients. We investigated all the factors possibly responsible for abnormal perpetuation of aplasia following infusion of cryopreserved marrow stem cells. The study of CFU-gm recovery in 41 bags of frozen marrow from 25 patients revealed an overall deficiency with a mean CFU-gm recovery of 55 +/- 38% in CGL patients versus 73 +/- 15% in the control group (p less than 0.001). Our data also showed an inverse linear relation (r = -0.40, p less than 0.05) between CFU-gm concentration and recovery after freezing. A good CFU-gm recovery (greater than or equal to = 50%) was observed in 70% of cases when the concentration was less than 3700 CFU-gm/ml as compared to 30% of cases when the concentration was over 3700 CFU-gm/ml (p less than 0.001). The lack of improvement by diluting rich CFU-gm marrows to reduce CFU-gm concentration/ml, as well as the absence of relationship between CFU-gm recovery after freezing and nucleated cells concentration, suggest a particular fragility of CGL stem cells to freezing, probably related to their excessive amplification. At the present time, we strongly recommend that the highest possible dose of progenitor cells be cryopreserved, preferably at a low concentration, in patients with CGL, and particular attention devoted to the freezing procedure in each individual patient, with numerous appropriate efficiency tests.","['Douay, L', 'Lopez, M', 'Gorin, N C', 'Nauman, A', 'Giarratana, M C', 'Laporte, J P', 'Stachowiak, J', 'Salmon, C', 'Duhamel, G']","['Douay L', 'Lopez M', 'Gorin NC', 'Nauman A', 'Giarratana MC', 'Laporte JP', 'Stachowiak J', 'Salmon C', 'Duhamel G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Freezing', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocytes/cytology/transplantation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/cytology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530040403 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1986 Jul;4(4):250-62. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530040403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the MNC from lymph nodes of patients with aleukemic NHL about 24% were DP IV positive corresponding to 57% of the T-cell fraction. MNC from bone marrow of these patients were shown to contain about 21% T-lymphocytes and 18% DP IV-reactive cells. In addition to that, cryostat sections of lymph nodes were analysed for the occurrence and distribution of DP IV. In normal lymph nodes and tonsils DP IV-positive cells have the same distribution pattern like T-cells in general. In lymph node sections from patients with NHL of B-cell origin, such as B-CLL, the DP IV-reactive cells are sparsely and irregularly distributed and displaced by the proliferating B-cells. It is concluded that DP IV is a useful marker not only for T-lymphocytes in proliferating lymphatic tissue but also an indicator of imbalances between regulatory T-cell subsets in peripheral blood.","['Schon, E', 'Essbach, U', 'Machura, R', 'Franke, A', 'Ansorge, S']","['Schon E', 'Essbach U', 'Machura R', 'Franke A', 'Ansorge S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Acta Histochem Suppl,Acta histochemica.

It has been demonstrated to cause rapid transformation of several cell types, including pre-B lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts. More recently, A-MuLV has been reported to induce thymic tumors in a mouse strain (C57BL/Ka) previously thought to be resistant to disease induction. We showed that the masses occurring after intrathymic injection of the virus were composed of lymphocytes of a previously described immature T-cell phenotype. This phenotype has been defined here by flow cytometry of 10 primary tumor samples stained with antibodies to several thymocyte differentiation antigens. Hybridization of DNAs from these tumors with v-abl, immunoglobulin mu, and T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain probes confirmed the T-lymphoid, polyclonal nature of the primary tumor cells. The primary tumors were malignant, as clearly shown by reinjection into Thy-congenic host animals. Further, four Thy- in vitro cell lines derived from three tumors differed from the majority of primary tumor cells and were similar to previously described A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells. The consistent T-lymphoid phenotype exhibited by primary A-MuLV thymomas may represent one stage of normal thymocyte differentiation.","['Scott, M L', 'Davis, M M', 'Feinberg, M B']","['Scott ML', 'Davis MM', 'Feinberg MB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogenes', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*microbiology', 'Thy-1 Antigens', 'Thymoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology/*microbiology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.59.2.434-443.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Aug;59(2):434-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.59.2.434-443.1986.,"['CA 03352/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC253094,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of leukemogenesis by HTLV, however, is still obscure. Two hypotheses have been proposed concerning abnormalities in IL-2 production and its receptor (Tac antigen) expression based on the experimental observations of IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines. In this study, we examine these hypotheses by using 3 leukemic T-cell lines from 3 Japanese patients with ATL. These cell lines were cultivated and established without addition of IL-2 to the culture medium. Cell-surface phenotype analysis by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and IL-2 binding assays revealed that one of the ATL cell lines, HPB-ATL-2, expresses only a minimal amount of IL-2 receptor (IL-2-R) on the cell surface and binds less radiolabelled human recombinant IL-2 than the other highly Tac-positive cell lines. Expression of Tac antigen in all ATL cell lines was not affected by IL-2, anti-Tac MAb or the tumor-promoter phorbol ester in the culture medium. The culture supernatant from these cell lines showed no IL-2 activity toward Con-A-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and their growth was not affected by additional IL-2 in cultures. IL-2-independent growth and constitutive expression of its receptors on the cell surface were evident in our ATL cell lines. However, dense expression of IL-2 receptors was not essential for stimulation of leukemic proliferation of T cells by HTLV-I. Trans-activation of the PX40 gene product of HTLV-I for activation of IL-2-R gene might not be coincidentally associated with stimulation for cell proliferation.","['Katoh, T', 'Harada, T', 'Morikawa, S', 'Wakutani, T']","['Katoh T', 'Harada T', 'Morikawa S', 'Wakutani T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*etiology', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV Antigens', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/08/15 00:00,1986/08/15 00:01,['1986/08/15 00:00'],"['1986/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910380218 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Aug 15;38(2):265-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910380218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These halos are thought to represent relaxed lengths of loops of DNA attached to the nuclear matrix. Measurement of transcription of RNA from nuclei in vitro suggested that cells with more loops (smaller halos) had more initiation sites for transcription. DNA loop number decreases during development of the frog embryos, and red blood cells of adults have even fewer and larger loops. One or two days of culture of Friend cells in various compounds that induce differentiation resulted in more DNA loops than for control cells, but after 5 days of culture the differentiated erythrocytes had fewer DNA loops than control cells at stationary phase. Stationary phase cells have almost twice as many DNA loops as log phase cells. Various compounds that stall cells at the G1/S border induced more DNA loops, but subsequently the number of DNA loops decreased as the cells entered S phase. A number of compounds which slow the rate of cell division cause the formation of more DNA loops, perhaps due to longer G1 periods.","['Flickinger, R A', 'Givens, R', 'Pine, S', 'Sepanik, P']","['Flickinger RA', 'Givens R', 'Pine S', 'Sepanik P']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cell Differ,Cell differentiation,0342640,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Histones)', '25086-81-1 (Poly T)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Clostridium perfringens', '*DNA', 'DNA, Bacterial/pharmacology', 'Histones/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Poly T/pharmacology', 'Ranidae/embryology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0045-6039(86)90026-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0045-6039(86)90026-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Differ. 1986 Jul;19(1):59-71. doi: 10.1016/0045-6039(86)90026-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from ATL patients and ATL cell lines such as Hut 102, MT 1, and MT 2 were not activated to proliferate by the stimulation with concanavalin A and suppressed normal lymphocyte proliferative responses induced with concanavalin A when cultured together. The sera from ATL patients and the culture supernatants from ATL cells and ATL cell lines also suppressed normal lymphocyte proliferative responses induced with concanavalin A. By Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography, the suppressive factors were fractionated as a single peak with the molecular weights of 50,000 to 70,000. The suppressive factors were unstable to acid treatment but stable to the treatment with base, heat, freezing-thawing, and trypsin. The factors suppressed the production of interleukin 2 by T-cells and the responsiveness of T-cells to interleukin 2, but not the expression of interleukin 2 receptors on T-cells and the production of interleukin 1 by monocytes. These results suggest that the immunosuppressive factors produced by ATL cells have some roles in the induction of immunodeficient states in ATL patients.","['Shirakawa, F', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Oda, S', 'Chiba, S', 'Suzuki, H', 'Eto, S', 'Yamashita, U']","['Shirakawa F', 'Tanaka Y', 'Oda S', 'Chiba S', 'Suzuki H', 'Eto S', 'Yamashita U']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/analysis/*immunology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Sep;46(9):4458-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report we have extended these studies to examine antibody therapy of aged AKR/J mice with spontaneous leukemia. Infusion of anti-Thy 1.1 antibody in frankly leukemic mice led to uniform early mortality from cell lysis and agglutination. In contrast, anti-Thy 1.1 antibody therapy of mice in remission following treatment with cyclophosphamide prolonged remission duration (P less than 0.001) and modestly prolonged survival (P less than 0.01) compared to treatment with irrelevant antibody or chemotherapy alone. The major cause of failure was relapse of leukemia. In 85% (47 of 55) of cases relapse was due to cells that continued to express Thy 1.1, but in 15% of these relapsing animals all leukemic cells failed to express the target antigen. Our results suggest that monoclonal antibody against a normal T-cell antigen can add to the antileukemic effects obtained with chemotherapy alone.

We have examined the transcription of these SFFV/MCF-related sequences in normal tissues of two mouse strains, ICFW and DBA/2. Cytoplasmic Poly A+ RNAs of normal mouse tissues were analyzed by dot-blot and Northern blot hybridizations with a subcloned env SFFV DNA fragment (0.4 kbp BamH I-Sma I). In both mice, the level of SFFV/MCF env related transcripts was very low in bone marrows and spleens whereas it was high in kidneys. Intermediate levels of transcripts were observed in other tissues (thymus, liver and brain). In both mouse strains, the size of SFFV/MCF env related transcripts varied from one tissue to another. Some transcripts in DBA/2 mice were reminiscent of full-size viral message indicating an occasional expression of xenotropic/MCF endogenous virus in this low-leukemic strain. Sizes of the other SFFV/MCF related env transcripts were unusual, but were similar in both strains for each tissue studied. This last result suggests a tissue-specific transcription of endogenous sequences related to the SFFV/MCF env gene. A 1.8 kb SFFV/MCF env RNA was the major transcript in the tissues which expressed a high level of these env transcripts. Treatment of mice with phenylhydrazine which greatly stimulates erythroid differentiation in spleens increased the level of SFFV/MCF related env RNAs only in the spleens, suggesting a possible correlation between the SFFV/MCF env transcription and the stimulation of the erythroid spleen cells.","['Robert-Lezenes, J', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F', 'Meneceur, P', 'Tambourin, P']","['Robert-Lezenes J', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Meneceur P', 'Tambourin P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '064F424C9K (phenylhydrazine)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phenylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Poly A/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01314141 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1986;90(1-2):15-28. doi: 10.1007/BF01314141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 20% of the drug appeared to be covalently bound to plasma proteins. Amsacrine was bound by all plasma proteins investigated including albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and various gamma-globulins. The binding to albumin appeared to occur by two processes, a saturable process at a single site with a KD of 13.9 mumol litre-1 and a non-saturable process.

The cells were fixed and labelled with monoclonal (OKT-9) anti-transferrin receptor antibodies; the antibody-labelled receptors were then detected by either immunofluorescein- or immunoferritin-antimouse-antibody conjugates. Typically, the immunoferritin labels were distributed diffusely at the non-coated regions of the cell surface as well as concentrated in the clathrin-coated pits. To examine further this pattern of distribution, cells were labelled at 0 degrees C and then warmed to 37 degrees C for zero to 30 min prior to fixation. The majority of the immunoferritin labels were initially dispersed in small groups at the non-coated regions of the cell surface (mean = 6 immunoferritin labels/cluster), but larger groups were common subsequent to incubation at 37 degrees C (mean = 13 immunoferritin labels/cluster). However, the size of immunoferritin labels in the coated pits was unchanged (mean = 12 immunoferritin labels/pit). Immunoferritin labels were typical in coated and uncoated vesicles 1 min after warming to 37 degrees C, but common in endosomes, multivesicular bodies and lysosomes by 30 min. It appears that single cell-surface receptors form large aggregates prior to their concentration in coated pits. Coated vesicles, uncoated vesicles, and endosomal vacuoles may together form the non-lysosomal compartment where the internalized receptors might be dissociated from the ligands (antibodies).","['Cheng, T P']",['Cheng TP'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00212541 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 1986;244(3):613-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00212541.,['GM 20396-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus could be transmitted with 20 ml of whole blood or washed blood cell suspension (fresh or stored for 1-2 weeks at 4 degrees C) but not with cell-free plasma from seroconverted rabbits. Seroconversion occurred 2-4 weeks after blood transfusion and serum anti-HTLV-I titers ranged from 1:20 to 1:640 with the immunofluorescence assay. From transfusion recipients of the 1st to 4th passages, virus-producing cell lines were established by culturing lymphocytes in the presence of T-cell growth factor (TCGF). Three of the 4 cell lines became TCGF-independent after 2-12 months of continuous culture. Blood was transfused between rabbits of opposite sexes and the recipient origin of each cell line was determined by chromosome analysis. We also investigated the effect of X-irradiation (6,000 rad) on blood from seropositive rabbits. Seroconversion likewise occurred in rabbits transfused with blood that had been irradiated immediately before transfusion but not in rabbits transfused with blood that had been irradiated and stored for 1-2 weeks at 4 degrees C.

Immunization with bacterial antigens or with spleen cell allografts prior to FVA inoculation rendered CBA/N mice highly susceptible to FVA. Transplantation studies confirmed that non-immunized CBA/N mice were able to both support erythroleukemic cells and permit erythroleukemic transformation, thus arguing against host defense mechanisms as a cause of resistance. On the basis of early erythroid progenitor cell sensitivity to hydroxyurea in vivo, the CBA/N strain appeared to have the FVA sensitive genotype (Fv-2ss). These results imply that CBA/N mice are not intrinsically resistant to FVA and that an as yet unknown type of immunological activity, evoked both by various immunizations and allogeneic transplantation, is required for Friend leukemogenesis in this immunodeficient inbred strain. These findings further suggest that the erythroid target cells transformed by Friend viruses are influenced by immunological activity.","['Worthington, R E', 'Van Zant, G']","['Worthington RE', 'Van Zant G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bordetella pertussis/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA/*physiology', 'Vaccination']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3441-4.,['5 R01 CA39266-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exosomes contained both stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding components of adenylate cyclase (the stimulatory, Gs, and the inhibitory, Gi, regulatory components) and beta-adrenergic receptors but were devoid of adenylate cyclase activity. It was therefore apparent that the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase was either not exfoliated or was inactivated during the exfoliation process. The presence of Gs or Gi in the exosomes was detected by ADP ribosylation using [alpha-32P]NAD in the presence of cholera or pertussis toxins, respectively. The exosomal concentration of each of the two components was estimated to be about one fifth of that of the cell membrane when expressed on a per mg protein basis. Exosomal Gs was almost as active as the membrane-derived Gs in its ability to reconstitute NaF- and guanine nucleotide-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of S49 cyc- cells, which lack a functional Gs. The ability of exosomal Gs to reconstitute isoproterenol-stimulated activity, however, was much lower than that of membrane Gs. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the exosomes was much less than that found in the membranes. Although the exosomal receptors bound the antagonist iodocyanopindolol with the same affinity as receptors from the cell membrane, the affinity for the agonist isoproterenol was 13- to 18-fold lower in the exosomes. In addition, this affinity was not modulated by GTP in the exosomes. Thus, exfoliated beta-adrenergic receptors seem to be impaired in their ability to couple to and activate Gs. This was directly tested by coupling the receptors to a foreign adenylate cyclase using membrane fusion. The fusates were then assayed for agonist-stimulated activity.

This steroid blocks the ability of the potent agonist triamcinolone acetonide (TA) to induce glutamine synthetase activity and to ultimately cause cell lysis, but when given alone does not exhibit partial agonist activity. Both [3H]RU 38486 and [3H]TA bind with high affinity and specificity to cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors in this cell line. However, under a variety of in vitro conditions (elevated temperature and presence of exogenous ATP), [3H]TA promotes receptor activation more effectively than [3H]RU 38486. This difference in the extent of activation was verified by two independent techniques: DEAE-cellulose chromatography and DNA-cellulose binding. [3H]RU 38486 and [3H]TA dissociate at the same rate from the unactivated receptors but at 25 degrees C (not 0 degree C) [3H]RU 38486 dissociates slightly more rapidly from the activated receptors. The defective receptors in the glucocorticoid-resistant subclone 3R7 appear to be ""activation labile"" (rapid dissociation of ligand from activated form) using either tritiated steroid. Once activated in vivo, the CEM-C7 [3H]TA- and [3H]RU 38486-receptor complexes undergo similar nuclear translocation and those activated complexes generated in vitro appear to bind to nonspecific DNA-cellulose with the same relative affinities. Thus the precise mechanism(s) by which RU 38486 exerts its potent antiglucocorticoid effect in this human cell line cannot be easily explained in terms of a defect in one of the crucial steps (specific high affinity binding, activation, translocation, DNA binding) required to elicit a physiological response. However, the data presented here do suggest that when comparing an antagonist and agonist which both bind to receptors with the same relative high affinity, the agonist may be more effective in facilitating the conformational change associated with in vitro activation.","['Schmidt, T J']",['Schmidt TJ'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Estrenes/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mifepristone', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0022-4731(86)90446-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1986 Apr;24(4):853-63. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(86)90446-2.,"['AM 25295/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AM 34490-01 PC/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase and folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity and in vitro tumor cell growth by methotrexate and aminopterin analogues containing a basic amino acid side chain.,655-60,"Analogues of the antitumor antifolate methotrexate (MTX) were synthesized in which the glutamate (Glu) moiety was replaced by ornithine (Orn), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), or 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap). An aminopterin (AMT) analogue with Orn in place of Glu was also synthesized. The MTX analogues were obtained by reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid (mAPA) and N omega-Boc-alpha,omega-diaminoalkanoic acids in the presence of diethyl phosphorocyanidate, followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or by reaction of p-nitrophenyl-mAPA and N omega-Boc-alpha,omega-diaminoalkanoic acids and subsequent treatment with TFA. The AMT analogue (APA-Orn) was synthesized by reaction of p-nitrophenyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroate with silylated N delta-Boc-L-ornithine in DMF at 55 degrees C for 3 days (45% yield), saponification (83%), and TFA cleavage (89%). APA-Orn was a potent inhibitor of both dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from L1210 mouse leukemia (IC50 = 0.072 microM) and partly purified folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) from mouse liver (Ki = 0.15 +/- 0.06 microM). The MTX analogue (mAPA-Orn) was likewise active against both enzymes, with an IC50 of 0.160 microM for DHFR and a Ki of 20.4 +/- 7.7 microM for FPGS inhibition. The other MTX analogues and the previously reported lysine derivative (mAPA-Lys) showed DHFR affinity similar to that of mAPA-Orn but lacked activity as FPGS inhibitors. The positively charged amino group appears to be detrimental to cellular uptake, as evidenced by the low cytotoxicity of these compounds (IC50 = 0.40-2.4 microM) in comparison with MTX and AMT (IC50 = 0.002 microM) against wild-type L1210 cells. On the other hand, mAPA-Orn and APA-Orn were both more potent than the corresponding Glu derivatives MTX and AMT against L1210/R81 cells, suggesting that in these MTX-resistant cells there may occur a ""self-potentiation"" process involving enhanced antifolate activity via interference with the polyglutamylation of reduced folates. APA-Orn is the most potent dual inhibitor of DHFR and FPGS discovered to date, but its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent may require some form of prodrug modification to neutralize the terminal amino group of the side chain.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Freisheim, J H', 'Moran, R G', 'Solan, V C', 'Bader, H', 'Wright, J E', 'Radike-Smith, M']","['Rosowsky A', 'Freisheim JH', 'Moran RG', 'Solan VC', 'Bader H', 'Wright JE', 'Radike-Smith M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Aminobutyrates)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '11P2JDE17B (beta-Alanine)', '305-62-4 (2,4-diaminobutyric acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '8908T5BN6R (2,3-diaminopropionic acid)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminobutyrates', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Ornithine', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'beta-Alanine/analogs & derivatives']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00155a012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 May;29(5):655-60. doi: 10.1021/jm00155a012.,"['CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30897/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of T-cells in host defense against FLV-induced leukemia was indicated by the fact that thymus-deprived C57BL/6N-nu/nu mice were sensitive to FLV, although normal C57BL/6N mice were, as already reported by many authors, resistant to FLV. In relation to the role of T-cells on the onset of FLV-induced leukemia, the population dynamics of the lymphocytic subpopulations of the systemic lymphoid organs after FLV injection in FLV-resistant C57BL/6N mice were examined in comparison with the dynamics in FLV-sensitive strains, C57BL/6N-nu/nu mice and normal C3H/HeN mice. In this system, Lyt-1+2- helper T-cells in the spleen of FLV-resistant C57BL/6N mice increased in number after FLV injection. The number of immunoglobulin positive cells did not remarkably change in FLV-resistant C57BL/6N mice after FLV injection, whereas the number increased in the lymph node of FLV-sensitive C3H/HeN mice. The results indicated that a major contribution to the relative susceptibility and resistance of the host to FLV was controlled by the capacity to mobilize T-cells to the spleen in an early stage of disease, although the interaction of these T-cells with other immune cells may play an important role in mediating host resistance to FLV-induced disease.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Matsubara, O', 'Kasuga, T']","['Kitagawa M', 'Matsubara O', 'Kasuga T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jun;46(6):3034-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that DDTC is unreactive toward DDP complexes in which both chlorides have been replaced by guanine residues but removes platinum from a variety of other ligands, and that this difference in reactivity may provide the basis for the selective protection observed with DDTC. Platinum-DNA complexes were unreactive toward DDTC (10 mM, greater than 4 h) when the platinum:base ratio r less than 0.02. DDTC did not react with the 1:2 complex of DDP:guanosine but reacted rapidly with the 1:1 complex and with the 1:2 complexes of DDP:adenosine. Reaction of DDP with DDTC was second order with a rate constant k = 4.4 M-1 min-1 at 37 degrees C, corresponding to a t 1/2 = 150 min at [DDTC] = 1 mM. Treatment of L1210 cells with DDTC (0.5-1 mM) after exposure to DDP indicated that DDTC had no effect on cell kill if DDTC treatment was delayed for 1 h after DDP. The effect of DDTC on DDP-induced DNA interstrand cross-links was also examined in L1210 cells. Interstrand cross-links were decreased by approximately 50% when cells were treated with DDTC immediately after DDP; no change in DNA interstrand cross-links was observed when DDTC treatment occurred 3 h after DDP. A modified alkaline elution procedure was used to evaluate the effects of high concentrations of DDTC, thiourea, and cyanide on platinum:DNA cross-links from L1210 DNA. Exposure to DDTC (0.5 M, 4 h) did not alter interstrand cross-links, but both thiourea and cyanide caused extensive reversal of cross-links at concentrations as low as 10 and 1 mM, respectively. Both commercial and rat kidney brush border preparations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were inhibited by exposure to 2 mM DDP; exposure of the inhibited enzyme to DDTC (1 or 10 mM) resulted in significant restoration of enzyme activity. These data indicate that DDTC has unique chemical specificity in its reactions with platinum complexes and that this specificity is ideal for application as a chemoprotective drug against cis-platinum toxicity.","['Bodenner, D L', 'Dedon, P C', 'Keng, P C', 'Borch, R F']","['Bodenner DL', 'Dedon PC', 'Keng PC', 'Borch RF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/metabolism/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Ditiocarb/*pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Thiocarbamates/*pharmacology', 'Thiourea/pharmacology', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jun;46(6):2745-50.,"['CA 11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition of cellular replication and the induced maturation produced by these agents appears to be a consequence of the inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, since growth inhibition is partially reversed and differentiation is completely prevented by the simultaneous exposure of cells treated with inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase to exogenous guanosine, which serves to circumvent the effects of the blockage of IMP dehydrogenase. The exposure of HL-60 leukemia cells to inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase caused a marked reduction in the incorporation of [3H]mannose into both cellular glycoproteins and their lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursors; these effects are presumably due to the pronounced decrease in intracellular levels of guanosine triphosphate produced by blockage of IMP dehydrogenase. Maximum effects on glycoprotein biosynthesis occurred within 8 h of exposure to the inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase. The simultaneous incubation of cells with guanosine and these inducers of differentiation partially prevented the reduction in [3H]mannose incorporation into glycoproteins, supporting a relationship between glycoprotein biosynthesis and guanosine triphosphate formation in the induction of differentiation by inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Blair, O C', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Blair OC', 'Sartorelli AC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '55598-56-6 (Dolichol Monophosphate Mannose)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'I5R2V02E8Z (selenazofurin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dolichol Monophosphate Mannose/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology', '*Organoselenium Compounds', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Selenium/pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 May;46(5):2314-9.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DAP IV was studied in leukaemic T-cells both by cytochemistry and by a monoclonal antibody with the immunoperoxidase technique. Both methods showed similar results. AP and ANAE gave weak reactions in immature B-cell leukaemias (common-ALL and B-CLL) and were strongly expressed in plasma cell disorders. DAP IV showed no activity in any of the types of B-cell leukaemia studied and was strongly positive in some T-cell leukaemias but with a more restricted distribution than ANAE and AP.

Modulation of T3 antigen and an increase in Tac antigen-positive cells occurred when cells from patients with T4 non-ATL were cultured with OKT3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Those changes in T3 antigen density and the appearance of Tac antigen-bearing cells by OKT3 mAb were not so marked when ATL cells were used. But the modulation of T3 antigen and the increase in Tac antigen-bearing cells by OKT3 mAb were closely related in cells from six ATL patients.

From these adapted cells, more than 30 clones were isolated. They all had much higher activity to take up cystine than the original L1210 cells, supporting a previous view that the deficiency of the cystine uptake limits the survival and growth of L1210 cells in vitro. The cystine uptake of one cloned cell line was characterized. The enhanced uptake of cystine in these cells was mainly mediated by a Na+-independent, saturable system and was potently inhibited by glutamate and some other anionic amino acids, but less by aspartate. Such activity of cystine uptake was not observed in the original L1210 cells.

Normal B lymphocytes differed from T cells and monocytes mainly in their 5'-N activity, whereas in monocytes, gamma-GT activity was more pronounced than in other normal blood cells. Hematopoietic cell lines showed some distinct patterns of ectoenzyme activity. Most B cell lines had high 5'-N and (Na-K-Mg) adenosine triphosphatase activities.

RA- or TPA-treated cells stopped proliferating, became adherent to plastic surfaces, and acquired the ability to phagocytose yeast cells, plain sheep RBCs, and IgG-coated sheep RBCs. The morphological and functional changes, induced by RA or TPA, were associated with a 20-50-fold increase in cellular transglutaminase activity. This increase in enzyme activity was found to be due to the induction of a specific intracellular transglutaminase, tissue transglutaminase. The induction of tissue transglutaminase was a specific response of THP-1 cells to differentiation and was not observed with agents that did not induce their morphological or functional differentiation. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP potentiated the RA-induced expression of tissue transglutaminase. A 15-min exposure to TPA was sufficient to induce differentiation and expression of tissue transglutaminase in THP-1 cells. In contrast, RA required a continuous exposure (48 h) to induce similar changes in morphology or enzyme activity. These results support the view that differentiation of cells of the monocytic lineage is associated with an induction and accumulation of the protein cross-linking enzyme tissue transglutaminase.","['Mehta, K', 'Lopez-Berestein, G']","['Mehta K', 'Lopez-Berestein G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*enzymology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transglutaminases/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Vitamin A/pharmacology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Mar;46(3):1388-94.,['BRSG-149308/RS/DRS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PBSC were collected by leukapheresis very early in first remission and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Both patients demonstrated early evidence of trilineage engraftment. The first patient received melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by rescue with 1.3 X 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg body weight containing 29 X 10(4) granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM)/kg, and HR was evident by Day 14. The second patient was treated with supralethal chemoradiotherapy followed by rescue with 3.0 X 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg containing 23 X 10(4) CFU-GM/kg. He demonstrated early engraftment with near normal peripheral blood counts by Day 16. There was a subsequent fall in both bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts to a level of low but persistent activity. There was a further phase of haematological recovery from 8 weeks following transplantation with an increase in peripheral blood counts and bone marrow cellularity until final relapse at 13 weeks. This study demonstrates that circulating stem cells have haemopoietic reconstitutive capacity, previously only shown with buffy coat cells from chronic granulocytic leukaemia.

Fresh ATL cells from patients and established ATL cell lines did not grow well in a low-calcium (less than 0.01 mM) medium. However, their growth was enhanced by the addition of calcium to the medium in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum response was induced at 4 mM calcium, which was higher than that of the normal serum calcium level, 2.5 mM. Other leukemia cells, except ATL, grew well in the low-calcium medium, and their growth was not enhanced by the addition of calcium. Calcium antagonists and calmodulin inhibitors inhibited the growth of ATL cells at the concentration of 10(-5)-10(-7) M, while they did not inhibit the growth of other leukemia cells. Furthermore, the expression of interleukin 2 receptors (Tac antigens) on ATL cells was also enhanced by calcium and was inhibited by calcium antagonists and calmodulin inhibitors. In accordance with these results, the increase of the extracellular calcium concentration resulted in the increase of the intracellular calcium concentration in ATL cells, but not in other leukemia cells.

Two receptor-containing lines of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one glucocorticoid sensitive (CEM-C7) and one glucocorticoid resistant (CEM-C1), were used to study endogenous synthesis of cholesterol with [14C]-acetate as a cholesterol precursor. We found that dexamethasone inhibited cholesterol synthesis in the glucocorticoid-sensitive clone but was without effect on the resistant clone. In sensitive cells, this reduction in synthesis was paralleled by a decreased activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (EC 1.1.3.5) and was followed by a moderate decrease in cellular free cholesterol. Moreover, sonic dispersions of cholesterol in delipidized serum when added to the cultures reversed the growth-inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on CEM-C7 cells.","['Madden, E A', 'Bishop, E J', 'Fiskin, A M', 'Melnykovych, G']","['Madden EA', 'Bishop EJ', 'Fiskin AM', 'Melnykovych G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.3.3.10 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/*physiopathology', '*Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;46(2):617-22.,['CA-08315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Leu 3a (helper) T cell subpopulation predominated in primary tumours, OKT8 positive (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells in metastases. Infiltrates in which OKT8 cells predominated were associated with ulceration, a high mitotic rate and thick primary tumours. The converse applied to Leu 3a infiltrates. Infiltrates with a high proportion of Leu 3a positive cells tended to be associated with Thy-1 positive, DR antigen negative tumours. Thy-1 antigens were predominantly expressed on primary tumours and rarely on metastases whereas the converse applied to expression of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) on melanoma cells. These findings suggest that certain melanoma antigens may be related to the nature of the lymphoid infiltrate associated with melanoma and possibly with the behaviour of the tumour in the host. They further suggest that identification of cell surface structures and lymphoid infiltrates by these techniques may be a valuable extension of routine histopathological assessment of prognosis in melanoma.","['Hersey, P', 'Murray, E', 'Grace, J', 'McCarthy, W H']","['Hersey P', 'Murray E', 'Grace J', 'McCarthy WH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Neprilysin', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00313028509105490 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 1985 Jul;17(3):385-91. doi: 10.3109/00313028509105490.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a patient with chronic ATL, whose leukemic cells proliferated in vitro in response to IL-2, we repeatedly established leukemic T cell clones having the same rearrangement profile of the T beta chain gene as the leukemic cells. By contrast, established cell lines from acute ATL patients had different beta chain gene rearrangements from those of the leukemic cells. These HTLV-I+ T cell lines might not be the direct progeny of the leukemic cells, but that of T cells infected either in vivo or in vitro. These IL-2-reactive nonleukemic T cells might have been selected in vitro, because their leukemic cells failed to respond to IL-2, despite the expression of IL-2 receptor.

LDL-receptor activity was found to be inversely correlated with plasma-cholesterol concentration. Patients with both a high LDL-receptor activity per cell and a high white-blood-cell count had the lowest cholesterol concentrations. During chemotherapy, cholesterol levels rose concomitantly with the disappearance from the peripheral blood of leukaemic cells. Hypocholesterolaemia in leukaemia and other neoplastic disorders may be due to increased LDL-receptor activity in the malignant cells.

Analyses of total DNA from the peripheral-blood cells during relapse showed that the c-myc oncogene was amplified about 30-fold in the leukaemic cells. The N-myc, c-mos, and c-myb oncogenes showed only single-copy signals. On average about two copies of c-myc resided on each dmin chromosome. The finding of amplification of a cellular oncogene (c-myc) in fresh AML cells containing double minute chromosomes suggests that clonal evolution of some leukaemia cell populations may involve selection for increased dosage of oncogenes.","['Alitalo, K', 'Saksela, K', 'Winqvist, R', 'Alitalo, R', 'Keski-Oja, J', 'Laiho, M', 'Ilvonen, M', 'Knuutila, S', 'de la Chapelle, A']","['Alitalo K', 'Saksela K', 'Winqvist R', 'Alitalo R', 'Keski-Oja J', 'Laiho M', 'Ilvonen M', 'Knuutila S', 'de la Chapelle A']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 4-5', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncogenes', 'Preleukemia/genetics', 'Trisomy']",1985/11/09 00:00,1985/11/09 00:01,['1985/11/09 00:00'],"['1985/11/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/09 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(85)90907-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(85)90907-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1985 Nov 9;2(8463):1035-9. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(85)90907-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On glass or plastic substrates, AtT20 cells grow in clumps. In this situation, retroviruses budding from the plasma membrane of one cell can, on rare occasions, be invested by coated pits in the plasma membranes of contiguous cells. These pits can invaginate to depths of 2,000-4,000 A within the cytoplasm drawing with them the viral buds which remain connected to their parental cells by tubular stalks, some of which are only 225 +/- 15 A in diameter. These stalks run down the straight necks of the pits from the buds to the parental cell surfaces. Several lines of evidence indicate that these unique structures are blocked such that neither endocytosis nor budding can go to completion, and that they persist for several hours. The properties of these blocked coated pits are relevant to models of both endocytosis and viral budding. First, they indicate that the invagination of a coated pit is not absolutely dependent on its pinching off to form a coated vesicle, but that uncoating appears to be dependent upon the generation of a free vesicle. Secondly, they suggest that the final stages in the maturation of a retroviral core into a mature nucleoid are dependent on the detachment of the bud from its parental cell and that the driving force of budding is the association of viral transmembrane proteins with viral core proteins. An explanation is offered to account for the formation of these structures despite the phenomenon of viral interference.","['Tooze, J']",['Tooze J'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/*ultrastructure', '*Endocytosis', 'Endosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Pituitary Neoplasms']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.101.5.1713 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1985 Nov;101(5 Pt 1):1713-23. doi: 10.1083/jcb.101.5.1713.,,PMC2113951,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cases identified recently by the authors are reported. Three of the patients were women, and their ages ranged from 36 to 60 years. The most important diagnostic clue was the observation of polylobated lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood. Other variably observed significant features included hypercalcemia, cutaneous eruptions, osteolytic bone lesion, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Surface marker studies revealed that the leukemic or lymphoma cells were T-helper cells. Histopathologic examination revealed one case of pleomorphic type and three cases of medium-sized cell type. No tissue was available for study in one case. The diagnosis of ATL was confirmed by the indirect immunofluorescence test on MT-1 cell for antibodies to adult T-cell leukemia virus-associated antigen (ATLA). Three patients were dead within 6 months, and two patients had been in clinical remission for 7 and 10 months, respectively. These two latter cases were similar to the so-called smoldering type of ATL. Two descendents among nine relatives of the patients were also positive for anti-ATLA (22%). Two husbands were negative. Four of the five patients lived in the same county in northeastern coastal Taiwan, which suggested a possible clustering of ATL in that region.","['Su, I J', 'Chan, H L', 'Kuo, T T', 'Eimoto, T', 'Maeda, Y', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Kuan, Y Z', 'Shih, L Y', 'Chen, M J', 'Takeshita, M']","['Su IJ', 'Chan HL', 'Kuo TT', 'Eimoto T', 'Maeda Y', 'Kikuchi M', 'Kuan YZ', 'Shih LY', 'Chen MJ', 'Takeshita M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Taiwan']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19851101)56:9<2217::aid-cncr2820560914>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Nov 1;56(9):2217-20. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19851101)56:9<2217::aid-cncr2820560914>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCS was filled with 100-150 ml bone marrow and centrifuged to prepare a buffy coat. This buffy coat was isolated in 10-15% of the original bone marrow volume and contained 64 +/- 8% of the nucleated cells (NC). Morphological examination revealed that the buffy coat was highly enriched for myeloblasts, promyelocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, whereas the contamination with granulocytes was reduced to 46 +/- 8% of the granulocytes initially present in the bone marrow suspension. In addition the contamination with red blood cells (RBC) was very low; the buffy coat contained only 6 +/- 2% of the RBC. Furthermore it was demonstrated by means of colony assays that the buffy coat was highly enriched for hematopoietic progenitor cells. It contained 91 +/- 6% of the granulocyte/monocyte progenitor cells (CFU-GM) and 87 +/- 9% of the erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E). These results are comparable to those obtained with continuous or semicontinuous blood cell processors. The advantages of the BCS is that it is a simple and inexpensive apparatus which fits in a normal blood bank centrifuge.

Starting with a hybridoma cell secreting an IgG3 anti-Thy-1.1 antibody, we isolated three variant hybridoma cell lines secreting anti-Thy-1.1 antibody of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes. Each antibody displayed identical antigen binding properties, but differed in their ability to mediate in vitro lysis of Thy-1.1+ AKR/J SL2 lymphoma cells. In assays of complement dependent cytotoxicity, the relative activity of each antibody isotype was IgG2a = IgG2b greater than IgG3 greater than IgG1. In assays of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity when using non-immune spleen cells as effectors, the relative activities were IgG2a greater than or equal to IgG2b greater than IgG1 greater than IgG3. Infusion of equivalent amounts of each antibody (1.5 mg) in AKR/Cum (Thy-1.2+) mice inoculated subcutaneously with 3 X 10(5) AKR/J SL2 lymphoma cells resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth only in mice treated with IgG2a antibody. However, the antibodies were cleared at different rates, with the IgG2a antibody having the slowest clearance. When antibody doses were adjusted to achieve equivalent serum levels 24 hr after infusion, all of the antibody isotypes exhibited at least some anti-tumor activity, although IgG2a antibody was again the most effective. These studies demonstrate that the difference in anti-tumor activity between antibodies of different isotypes may result from differences both in their serum clearance rate and their ability to interact with host effector mechanisms.","['Denkers, E Y', 'Badger, C C', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Bernstein, I D']","['Denkers EY', 'Badger CC', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Bernstein ID']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Sep;135(3):2183-6.,['CA26386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, viral antigens (HTLV-A) are not usually expressed in vivo. It has been shown that HTLV-I antigens are spontaneously induced after culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with ATL and healthy carriers (HC), who are viral antibody-positive. In the present communication, we show the suppressive effect of human serum antibodies against HTLV-I on viral antigen expression in PBL derived from ATL patients and HC. Viral antigen synthesis in various PBL specimens is variable in terms of frequencies and kinetics. (1) Low concentrations (2%) of antibody-positive but not of antibody-negative sera efficiently suppressed HTLV antigen induction in lymphocytes from both ATL patients and HC. (2) An inhibitory effect was exerted by HTLV-I-specific antibodies which originated from either ATL, HC or even HTLV-I-positive monkeys. (3) Sera showed a fairly wide range of suppressive activity in view of their concentrations. (4) At the late stage of cultures even continuous presence of antibodies frequently failed to suppress antigen synthesis in lymphocytes. (5) Antibodies were less effective in suppressing the increase of antigens if they were added to cultures which had already HTLV-A-positive lymphocytes in antibody-free media. (6) Pretreatment with protein A completely abolished the activities of the suppressive plasmas. (7) Antibodies did not affect the inhibition of spontaneous or chemical induction of HTLV-A in 2 HTLV-I-positive cell lines. These results suggest that HTLV-I antigen expression in leukemic cells from patients with ATL in vivo and in vitro is partly regulated by antibodies to HTLV-I. Furthermore, at least 2 different pathways, one antibody-sensitive and the other -insensitive, might exist to express HTLV-A.","['Tochikura, T', 'Iwahashi, M', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Tochikura T', 'Iwahashi M', 'Matsumoto T', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Hinuma Y', 'Yamamoto N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Carrier State/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors']",1985/07/15 00:00,1985/07/15 00:01,['1985/07/15 00:00'],"['1985/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360102 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Jul 15;36(1):1-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases the serum is positive for anti-human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus (HTLV-I) antibodies and the ATL cells contain the proviral DNA of HTLV-I. Variations in the clinical features of atypical cases suggest a division of the spectrum of ATL into five types: acute (prototypic), chronic, smoldering, crisis, and lymphoma. Screening of the sera from healthy adults for presence of the anti-HTLV-I antibodies revealed that 3.6% of healthy individuals in Kumamoto Prefecture, which is located in the middle of Kyushu, were HTLV-I carriers. The percentage of positivity increased with age and was higher in females than in males. It varied from town to town, ranging from 0 to 17.6%. Family studies showed that the routes of natural infection of HTLV-I are from mother to child and also from husband to wife. The third route is blood transfusion. The borderline between the healthy carrier state and smoldering ATL remains unclear. In the endemic areas smoldering ATL is frequently diagnosed in patients with fungus infection of the skin, chronic lymphadenopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, chronic renal failure, and strongyloidiasis.

One murine T-lymphoma, AKR/J SL2, was targeted with anti-thy 1.1; another, R1.1, was targeted with anti-H2Kk. The following important parameters were established concerning efficacy of antibody-directed liposomes as a drug delivery system. (1) Targeted liposomes containing methotrexate-gamma-aspartate were 20-40 times more cytotoxic than the free drug or nonspecific liposomes. (2) The use of drugs such as methotrexate-gamma-aspartate, which are unable to enter cells without a carrier, eliminates the nonspecific effects of drug that may leak from the liposomes. (3) Liposomes conjugated to antibody have a higher valency than the soluble antibody and bind to cells with up to 1000-fold higher affinity constant. (4) Liposomes that interact with more than one type of ligand on the cell surface show marked resistance to inhibition of cell association by soluble ligands.

Under these conditions, the cell-associated radioactivity remains unchanged, even after a washout period and addition of large excess (10(-3) M) of histamine, indicating an irreversible interaction between histamine and HL-60 cells. The interaction of 3H-H with HL-60 cells depends on cell viability, cell concentration and was reduced by various metabolic inhibitors such as iodacetamide, dinitrophenol, sodium azide and ouabain. Histamine uptake by HL-60 cells was inhibited by a series of H1, H2 histamine agonists (impromidine, histamine, 4-MH, AET, PEA) and antagonists (cimetidine, oxmetidine, ranitidine, diphenhydramine), according to the following order of potencies: 1 greater than H, 4-MH greater than AET greater than PEA and H,C greater than DPH.

A distinctive leukocyte perhaps related to natural killer cells.,1368-83,"Bone marrow-derived leukocytes of murine epidermis can express two phenotypes: typical Langerhans cells, which are Ia+ and Thy-1-, and a recently discovered second population that is Thy-1+ and Ia-. To verify that these phenotypes are expressed by two different cell types, and to help understand their lineage and function, we have studied morphology and reactivity with a large panel of antibodies. Dual antibody immunofluorescence combined with electron microscopy showed that Thy-1+ and Ia+ cells were each distributed in a regular fashion and formed adjacent dendritic systems in or close to the basal layer. Double-labeling studies with anti-Ia and a second monoclonal antibody revealed that all Langerhans cells expressed F4/80 (macrophage), Mac-1 (C3bi receptor), and 2.4G2 (Fc receptor), as well as the thymus leukemia (TL) and heat-stable (M1.69/16) antigens. A large fraction expressed S100 and all exhibited membrane ATPase and nonspecific esterase. In contrast, Thy-1+ cells lacked all these features of Langerhans cells, except that a minority were strongly reactive with 2.4G2. Thy-1+ cells also lacked differentiation antigens of most other types of leukocytes, except they were rich in asialo GM1. By electron microscopy, Thy-1+ cells had cytoplasmic granules that were similar in structure and in their aryl sulfatase content to those previously described in natural killer cells. The granules were enlarged in beige mice, suggesting a lysosomal origin, and were present in mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, indicating no relation to mast cells. We conclude that Thy-1+ epidermal cells are thoroughly distinct from Langerhans cells. On the basis of morphology and phenotype, they may represent a type of tissue natural killer cell. Thy-1+ natural killer cells are now being identified in several nonlymphoid sites, such as gut epithelium and the livers of mice given adjuvants. If Thy-1+ epidermal cells prove to be natural killer cells, it is noteworthy that they represent a resident population regularly distributed in the basal layer of all mouse strains. The notion that Thy-1+ epidermal cells are immature natural killer cells is intriguing in light of recent evidence that Ia+ Langerhans cells are also immature with respect to accessory cell function. The epidermis may not have the functional capacities of a lymphoid organ, but it could contribute immature cells important for both natural and acquired resistance.","['Romani, N', 'Stingl, G', 'Tschachler, E', 'Witmer, M D', 'Steinman, R M', 'Shevach, E M', 'Schuler, G']","['Romani N', 'Stingl G', 'Tschachler E', 'Witmer MD', 'Steinman RM', 'Shevach EM', 'Schuler G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Immunochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Langerhans Cells/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Skin/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Thy-1 Antigens']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.161.6.1368 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Jun 1;161(6):1368-83. doi: 10.1084/jem.161.6.1368.,,PMC2187637,,,,,67,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible role of a guanine nucleotide binding protein in transduction of this membrane signal, we examined the effects of pertussis toxin on chemotactic peptide-stimulated inositol phospholipid metabolism in differentiated HL-60 cells labeled with [3H]inositol. Pertussis toxin inhibited the chemotactic tripeptide-stimulated production of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates and secretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with pertussis toxin did not alter the total incorporation or the distribution of [3H]inositol in inositol phospholipid. Chemotactic peptide receptor number was unchanged, although a slight decrease in binding affinity was observed. These findings suggest a role for a guanine nucleotide binding protein in coupling the chemotactic peptide receptor to phospholipase C.","['Brandt, S J', 'Dougherty, R W', 'Lapetina, E G', 'Niedel, J E']","['Brandt SJ', 'Dougherty RW', 'Lapetina EG', 'Niedel JE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Bordetella pertussis', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Type C Phospholipases/physiology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.10.3277 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 May;82(10):3277-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.10.3277.,"['AI 18308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC397758,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 36 B-cell leukaemias and all 16 B-cell lymphomas showed rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes; the T-cell-receptor gene was in the germline configuration in most of these cases but showed a rearranged pattern in 3 cases (2 chronic lymphatic leukaemias and 1 immunoblastic lymphoma).

Donors in all cases were siblings who were matched for all major-histocompatibility-complex determinants. All patients were neutropenic to varying degrees at the onset of respiratory symptoms. Histological evaluation in all patients at necropsy showed diffuse alveolar damage with no evidence of intrapulmonary neutrophil sequestration. No patient had detectable levels of plasma peroxidation products, which were measured as an index of neutrophil oxidant function. Significantly increased clearance of inhaled 99mTc-diethylene-triamine-pentacetate was a uniform finding, suggesting impaired alveolar-capillary barrier function in keeping with ARDS. An increase in an index of lung epithelial permeability leading to ARDS may develop in neutropenic patients who have evidence of neither intrapulmonary neutrophil sequestration not tissue oxidant injury. ARDS after BMT is probably multifactorial in aetiology, but neutrophil-derived oxidant products play no part in its genesis.","['Braude, S', 'Apperley, J', 'Krausz, T', 'Goldman, J M', 'Royston, D']","['Braude S', 'Apperley J', 'Krausz T', 'Goldman JM', 'Royston D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Lipid Peroxides)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Lung/anatomy & histology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Organ Size', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/metabolism/pathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/blood/*etiology/pathology']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(85)92312-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(85)92312-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1985 Jun 1;1(8440):1239-42. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(85)92312-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A favourable outcome for ALL relapsing after BMT was predicted by the pace of the disease: the 5 survivors had an interval between diagnosis and first relapse of more than 2 years and a disease-free period after BMT of 500 days or more.
