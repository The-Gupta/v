Efforts to decrease relapse have included donor lymphocyte infusion to stimulate donor anti-recipient T-cell allorecognition of major and minor histocompatibility differences. Recently, alloreactive effects of donor natural killer cell-mediated inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) recognition of recipient HLA-C and -B ligands have been described. We examined KIR ligand effects on risk of relapse in 1770 patients undergoing myeloablative T-replete HCT from HLA-matched or -mismatched unrelated donors for the treatment of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. KIR ligands defined by HLA-B and -C genotypes were used to determine donor-recipient ligand incompatibility or recipient lack of KIR ligand. Among HLA-mismatched transplantations, recipient homozygosity for HLA-B or -C KIR epitopes predicted lack of KIR ligand and was associated with a decreased hazard of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, .043-0.85; P = .004). Absence of HLA-C group 2 or HLA-Bw4 KIR ligands was associated with lower hazards of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.79, P = .004; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.97; P = .04, respectively). The decrease in hazard of relapse in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia was similar to that in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = .95). Recipient homozygosity for HLA-B or -C epitopes that define KIR ligands is likely to be a predictive factor for leukemia relapse after myeloablative HCT from HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. This effect was not observed in HLA-identical unrelated transplants.","['Hsu, Katharine C', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Malkki, Mari', 'Pinto-Agnello, Clara', 'Dupont, Bo', 'Bignon, Jean-Denis', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Christiansen, Frank', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Oudshoorn, Machteld', 'Ringden, Olle', 'van Rood, Jon J', 'Petersdorf, Effie']","['Hsu KC', 'Gooley T', 'Malkki M', 'Pinto-Agnello C', 'Dupont B', 'Bignon JD', 'Bornhauser M', 'Christiansen F', 'Gratwohl A', 'Morishima Y', 'Oudshoorn M', 'Ringden O', 'van Rood JJ', 'Petersdorf E']","['Adult Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. hsuk@mskcc.org']",['International Histocompatibility Working Group'],['eng'],"['P01 CA 023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 AI 49215/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 AI49213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 AI 069197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-Bw4 antigen)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Epitopes/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Ligands', '*Living Donors', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/mortality', 'Male', 'Receptors, Immunologic/agonists/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00317-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Aug;12(8):828-36. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.04.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has shifted from a preferred first-line therapy to a possible second- or third-line therapy. However, despite generally excellent responses to imatinib, some patients respond poorly or lose response, and the risk-benefit equation in these cases may rapidly shift in favor of the alloSCT option. These patients need to be identified as soon as possible so that the alloSCT option can be applied while they are still in controlled chronic phase. Monitoring of imatinib response in patients who have suitable donors and are potentially eligible for alloSCT needs to be frequent, sensitive, and accurate. Clear criteria for switching from imatinib therapy to the alloSCT option should be established for each patient according to the specific risk profile of the transplant. The potential efficacy and safety of clinical trials combining reduced intensity alloSCT with ABL kinase inhibitor therapy warrants further consideration.","['Grigg, Andrew', 'Hughes, Timothy']","['Grigg A', 'Hughes T']","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. andrew.grigg@mh.org.au']",,['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/history/*therapy', 'Piperazines/history/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/history/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/history/*therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00293-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Aug;12(8):795-807. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.03.012.,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemokine CXCL14 (BRAK) is highly expressed in all normal tissues, but is not expressed in most malignant tissues. The chemotactic activity of CXCL14 has been difficult to characterize. Recently it was reported that CXCL14 is a chemoattractant for activated monocytes and immature dendritic cells. Given that CXCL14 is downregulated upon transition to malignancy, we sought to characterize whether CXCL14 might play a role in NK cell chemotaxis. METHODS: Human natural killer (NK) cells were isolated from buffy coats obtained from normal volunteers and were activated with lymphocyte conditioned media, IL-2, and ionomycin. Standard transwell chemotaxis assays, proliferation assays, and chromium release cell cytotoxicity assays were performed. RESULTS: CXCL14 was found to stimulate migration of activated human NK cells in transwell chemotaxis assays by 1.4-fold. Similarly, it increased migration of an IL-2-dependent natural killer leukemia (NKL) cell line by 1.9-fold. Antisera against CXCL14 or pertussis toxin blocked this chemotactic effect. However, CXCL14 did not affect the proliferation or cytotoxic activity of normal human NK cells. CXCL14 also stimulated the chemotaxis of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL14 may play a role in the trafficking of NK cells to sites of inflammation or malignancy. In addition, the downregulation of the expression of CXCL14 might be an important step in successful oncogenesis to prevent NK immune surveillance of the malignancy.","['Starnes, Trevor', 'Rasila, Kanwaldeep Kaur', 'Robertson, Michael J', 'Brahmi, Zacharie', 'Dahl, Richard', 'Christopherson, Kent', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Starnes T', 'Rasila KK', 'Robertson MJ', 'Brahmi Z', 'Dahl R', 'Christopherson K', 'Hromas R']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Walther Oncology Center with Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",,['eng'],"['HL66308/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CXCL14 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokines, CXC/analysis/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Dendritic Cells/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasms/*immunology']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00332-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Aug;34(8):1101-5. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many FoxP3+ T cells, generated in thymus as the result of T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of self antigens, preferentially migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and spleen in a manner similar to conventional naive T cells. FoxP3+ T cells differentiated in the periphery acquire homing phenotype to bone marrow and nonlymphoid tissues. Consistently, lymphoid- and nonlymphoid-tissue-homing FoxP3+ T cell subsets express different trafficking and chemokine receptors. FoxP3+ T cells regulate hematopoiesis by limiting the activation of immune cells and their production of hematopoietic cytokines available for stem and progenitor cells. In mice deficient in FoxP3+ T cells, aberrant regulation of hematopoiesis including excessive myelopoiesis occurs. In transplantation of allogenic hematopoietic cells, FoxP3+ T cells selectively suppress harmful graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) but leave beneficial graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) activity intact. Therefore, FoxP3+ T cells play essential roles in regulation of the hematolymphoid system in health and diseases, and are likely to be utilized as effective therapeutics for many diseases in the hematolymphoid system in the future.","['Kim, Chang H']",['Kim CH'],"['Laboratory of Immunology and Hematopoiesis, Department of Pathobiology, Purdue Cancer Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA. chkim@purdue.edu']",,['eng'],['AI063064/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/physiology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00235-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Aug;34(8):1033-40. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.014.,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data demonstrated that NX0101 induced much more significant body and immune organ weight loss in the infected commercial broiler chickens in an earlier age than that in the SPF white Leghorn chickens. At the same time antibody responses to vaccinations of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bursa disease virus (IBDV) in the NX0101-infected chickens were also evaluated and compared between the commercial broiler chickens and the SPF white Leghorn chickens. Compared with the control group of chickens, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response to NDV vaccines was significantly reduced in the NX0101-infected commercial broiler chickens from as early as 20 days after vaccination. However, no significant difference in HI antibody response was seen when HI titers reached their peaks in the NX0101-inoculated and control SPF white Leghorn chickens, except it declined significantly faster in infected birds. Neither of these two types of chickens showed significant decrease of antibody response to IBDV vaccination. Herein, we conclude that this NX0101 strain of ALV-J could selectively suppress humoral immune reactions to NDV, especially in broilers. But challenge experiments were not conducted and, therefore, it cannot be known if decreased antibody levels correlated with decreased protection against NDV in this case.","['Cui, Zhizhong', 'Sun, Shuhong', 'Wang, Jianxin']","['Cui Z', 'Sun S', 'Wang J']","['Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, P R China.']",,['eng'],,"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*immunology', 'Birnaviridae Infections/prevention & control/veterinary', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*immunology/virology', 'China', 'Infectious bursal disease virus/immunology', 'Newcastle Disease/*immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Newcastle disease virus/*immunology', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/prevention & control/*virology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1637/7409-071305R1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2006 Jun;50(2):191-5. doi: 10.1637/7409-071305R1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical examination revealed normotensive state and normal consciousness. On the 27th day, systemic seizures developed with mild hypertension (BP 151/98 mmHg). Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain showed areas of hypodensity in the bilateral white matter, and in the occipital and posterior parietal areas. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed some high intensity area involving the white matter, but also involving the cortex in the same area. Because the patient's condition progressed into unconsciousness and apnea from recurrent seizures, a respirator and anticonvulsants were needed. Four days later, the patient's general condition dramatically improved. There were no abnormal findings on MRI, and we diagnosed the cause of the seizures as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). In adults, RPLS caused by chemotherapy is rare, especially L-ASP. Our patient did not have any previous history of convulsion up to the LAdVP, which brought on the seizures. It was considered that the RPLS might be caused by L-ASP, which had been given to this patient for the first time and was being given to him at the time of developing the seizures.

The male:female ratio was 1.8:1. The median age was 60 months with an interquartile range of 36-84 months. 50% of the children were from the Port Moresby area, 15% from Central Province and 35% were referred from other provinces. Lymphoma, with Burkitt's lymphoma predominating, was as common as leukaemia. 20 (31%) of the children presented either at an advanced stage of disease or with cancer associated with a poor prognosis with available treatment, and were not offered curative treatment. 2 children transferred overseas for treatment. Of 42 families offered treatment 38 accepted and continued. At review 5 years after the start of the study 19 of the 20 children not offered treatment were known to have died and the outcome for 1 was unknown. Of the 38 children who underwent treatment at PMGH 24 (63%) were known to have died, 2 (5%) were still under treatment, 7 (18%) were in remission and the outcome for 5 (13%) was unknown. Of the 24 known to have died, remission induction failed in 16, relapse followed remission in 3 and 5 died from infection. The mean (SD) survival of those who died was 3.9 (3.4) months. 24 (51%) of the 47 known deceased children died in hospital, including 7 (32%) of the 22 referred patients. Significant problems were encountered in patient treatment. Infections occurred in 74% of treated children and drug shortages were experienced in 26%. The substantial problems faced by the families included marital discord, major financial hardship and, for those referred from other provinces whose children died, major delays and difficulties in repatriation. It is suggested that in Papua New Guinea the most appropriate approach to treatment for most children with cancer is the model in which paediatricians at the child's nearest appropriately staffed hospital take responsibility. Appropriate drug regimens, readily available drugs, ongoing advice and data collection should be coordinated through a central source. Accurate data should facilitate rational decisions.","['Kiromat, M', 'Vince, J D', 'Oswyn, G', 'Tefuarani, N']","['Kiromat M', 'Vince JD', 'Oswyn G', 'Tefuarani N']","['Department of Paediatrics, Port Moresby General Hospital, Papua New Guinea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Papua New Guinea,P N G Med J,Papua and New Guinea medical journal,0376417,,IM,"['Child', 'Developed Countries', 'Female', 'Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Papua New Guinea/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance', 'Registries']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,P N G Med J. 2004 Sep-Dec;47(3-4):138-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of infections in CLL is related to hypo-gamma-globulinemia, T-cell immune dysfunction, and the immunosuppressive effect of treatment. METHODS: The authors retrospectively assessed the correlations between new prognostic markers and types of infections encountered, the time taken to develop these infections, and infection-related mortality in 280 unselected patients with CLL. RESULTS: One hundred patients (36%) had at least 1 major infection (median, 2 major infections; range, 1-8 major infections) over a median follow-up of 67 months. Infections were the most common cause of death, accounting for 51% of all fatalities. Older age (P = .007), clinical Stage B or C disease (P < .001), unmutated immunoglobulin (Ig)VH gene status (P < .001), genetic abnormalities (P < .001), positive CD38 status (P < .001), and type of initial therapy were associated with a significantly shorter time to first infection. Equally, patient age (P < .001), disease stage (P < .001), CD38 expression (P < .001), IgVH mutation status (P < .001), and genetic abnormalities (P = .003) had a significant impact on infection-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage at diagnosis, IgVH mutation status, and initial therapy were possible predictors of severe infections in patients with CLL. The current results may help to identify which patients with CLL are at particularly high risk of developing serious infections and, thus, should be considered for Ig or antibiotic prophylaxis.","['Francis, Sebastian', 'Karanth, Mamatha', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Starczynski, Jane', 'Hooper, Laura', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Milligan, Donald W', 'Delgado, Julio']","['Francis S', 'Karanth M', 'Pratt G', 'Starczynski J', 'Hooper L', 'Fegan C', 'Pepper C', 'Valcarcel D', 'Milligan DW', 'Delgado J']","['Department of Hematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Incidence', 'Infections/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/03 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22094 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Sep 1;107(5):1023-33. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22094.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: A randomized clinical trial was carried out. Patients from 3 to 18 years of age treated with chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation between May, 2003 and February, 2005 were eligible. The intervention group received laser application for 5 days following the start of chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Sixty patients were evaluable for analysis; thirty-nine (65%) were males, 35 (58%) patients had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma, and 25 (42%) had solid tumors. The mean age was 8.7 +/- 4.3 years. Twenty-nine patients were randomized in the laser group and 31 in the control group. On day 1, no patients presented with mucositis.

We implemented a data management program in the oncology unit of the children's hospital of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and then we assessed training and supervision of data managers, data accuracy, and completeness as well as obstacles encountered. METHODS: Training included 2 days of off-site hands-on instruction in the use of an online database, daily on-site supervision by physicians, periodic online meetings for education and problem-solving, and continuous e-mail support. RESULTS: Of the 652 patients diagnosed with acute leukemia between July 1995 and June 2005, 150 (23%) had not yet been registered in the database at the time of audit and 65 (10%) had missing medical records. The remaining 437 charts (67%) were reviewed by an external auditor and compared to the data entered previously by the two trained data managers. Protocol information was incomplete in 30% of cases, and the cause of death was inaccurate in 18%. All other data were 99% accurate and 93%-100% complete. Obstacles included a limited medical records system, poor organization of the charts, missing records, inconsistently documented protocol information, data managers who lack a medical background, and slow or unreliable internet connections.

Along with the increasing use and complexity of these procedures comes concern about the cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure to children. Children are considerably more sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation than adults, and children have a longer life expectancy in which to express risk. Numerous epidemiologic cohort studies of childhood exposure to radiation for treatment of benign diseases have demonstrated radiation-related risks of cancer of the thyroid, breast, brain and skin, as well as leukemia. Many fewer studies have evaluated cancer risk following diagnostic radiation exposure in children. Although radiation dose for a single procedure might be low, pediatric patients often receive repeated examinations over time to evaluate their conditions, which could result in relatively high cumulative doses. Several cohort studies of girls and young women subjected to multiple diagnostic radiation exposures have been informative about increased mortality from breast cancer with increasing radiation dose, and case-control studies of childhood leukemia and postnatal diagnostic radiation exposure have suggested increased risks with an increasing number of examinations. Only two long-term follow-up studies of cancer following cardiac catheterization in childhood have been conducted, and neither reported an overall increased risk of cancer. Most cancers can be induced by radiation, and a linear dose-response has been noted for most solid cancers. Risks of radiation-related cancer are greatest for those exposed early in life, and these risks appear to persist throughout life.","['Kleinerman, Ruth A']",['Kleinerman RA'],"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, EPS 7044, 6120 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20852, USA. kleinerr@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Body Burden', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation', 'Radiography/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiotherapy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'United States']",2006/07/25 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00247-006-0191-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2006 Sep;36 Suppl 2:121-5. doi: 10.1007/s00247-006-0191-5.,32,,,['Pediatr Radiol. 2007 Jan;37(1):109-11.

The tax A substrain has been found at a higher frequency among human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (TSP/HAM) patients than among healthy HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic subjects in Japan. In this study, we determined the distribution of tax substrains in HTLV-I-infected subjects in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Using the ACCII restriction enzyme site, we detected only tax A substrain from 48 TSP/HAM patients and 28 healthy HTLV-I carriers. The sequenced tax genes from nine TSP/HAM patients and five asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers showed a similar pattern of mutation, which characterizes tax A. Our results indicate that HTLV-I tax subtypes have no significant influences on TSP/HAM disease progression.

PLZF is expressed in melanocytes but not in melanoma cells, and recovery of PLZF expression markedly suppresses melanoma cell growth. Several target genes regulated by PLZF have been identified, but the precise function of PLZF remains uncertain. Here, we searched for candidate target genes of PLZF by DNA microarray analysis. Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) was one of the prominently suppressed genes. Pbx1 was highly expressed in melanoma cells, and its expression was reduced by transduction with the PLZF gene. Moreover, the growth suppression mediated by PLZF was reversed by enforced expression of Pbx1. Knockdown of Pbx1 by specific small interfering RNAs suppressed melanoma cell growth. We also found that Pbx1 binds HoxB7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that repression of Pbx1 by PLZF reduces the expression of HoxB7 target genes, including tumor-associated neoangiogenesis factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin-2 and matrix metalloprotease 9. These findings suggest that deregulation of Pbx1 expression owing to loss of PLZF expression contributes to the progression and/or pathogenesis of melanoma.","['Shiraishi, K', 'Yamasaki, K', 'Nanba, D', 'Inoue, H', 'Hanakawa, Y', 'Shirakata, Y', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Higashiyama, S']","['Shiraishi K', 'Yamasaki K', 'Nanba D', 'Inoue H', 'Hanakawa Y', 'Shirakata Y', 'Hashimoto K', 'Higashiyama S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Shitsukawa, Toon, Ehime, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",2006/07/25 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209800 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209800 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jan 18;26(3):339-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209800.

While the knowledge regarding NF-kappaB signaling pathways initiated by extracellular ligands is rapidly expanding, the mechanisms of activation by intracellular stress conditions are not well understood. We recently described a critical role for a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase, in response to certain genotoxic stress conditions. One important unanswered question is whether the role of this modification is limited to the genotoxic agents or some other signaling pathways also employ SUMOylation of NEMO to regulate NF-kappaB activation. Here, we report that a variety of other stress conditions, including oxidative stress, ethanol exposure, heat shock and electric shock, also induce NEMO SUMOylation, thus demonstrating that DNA damage per se is not necessary for this NEMO modification to occur. Moreover, combinations of certain SUMO stress and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation conditions lead to NF-kappaB activation without inducing DNA damage. Our study helps to conceptualize how individual or a combination of different stress conditions may funnel into this previously unappreciated signal transduction mechanism to regulate the activity of the ubiquitous NF-kappaB transcription factor.","['Wuerzberger-Davis, S M', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Seufzer, B J', 'Miyamoto, S']","['Wuerzberger-Davis SM', 'Nakamura Y', 'Seufzer BJ', 'Miyamoto S']","['Cancer Biology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01-CA77474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA81065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NEMO protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Heat-Shock Response/physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Kidney/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin']",2006/07/25 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209815 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209815 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Feb 1;26(5):641-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209815.

Since following NST in comparison with myeloablative conditioning, higher proportions of host immunohematopoietic cells may persist while donor-derived alloreactive lymphocytes are being infused, thus possibly serving as host antigen presentation for continuous stimulation of donor T cells, we speculated that GVHD may be similarly amplified by conditioning followed by intentional administration of host cells. This hypothesis was tested in a preclinical animal model. Increased incidence of GVHD, higher mortality and increased levels of chimerism were observed in recipients reconstituted with host cells, particularly with non-irradiated spleen cells. Graft-versus-leukemia effect was not impaired by post transplant cell administration. These results suggest that GVHD may be amplified by recipient cell infusion using either irradiated or viable stimulatory host cells, thus possibly explaining in part higher than anticipated incidence of GVHD and rapid displacement of host cells and conversion to 100% donor type cells following NST. Administration of irradiated host antigen-presenting cells post transplantation may thus represent a potential approach for amplification of the alloreactive capacity of donor lymphocytes following stem cell transplantation.","['Hirshfeld, E', 'Weiss, L', 'Kasir, J', 'Zeira, M', 'Slavin, S', 'Shapira, M Y']","['Hirshfeld E', 'Weiss L', 'Kasir J', 'Zeira M', 'Slavin S', 'Shapira MY']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Animal', '*Transplantation Chimera/anatomy & histology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705449 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705449 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Sep;38(5):359-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705449.

Eradication of these cancer stem cells is probably a critical part of any successful anti-cancer therapy, and may explain why conventional cancer therapies are often effective in reducing tumour burden, but are only rarely curative. Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal, the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed. However, it remains unclear whether cancer stem cells must be phenotypically similar to normal tissue stem cells or whether they can retain the identity of committed progenitors. Here we show that leukaemia stem cells (LSC) can maintain the global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated programme. We isolated LSC from leukaemias initiated in committed granulocyte macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL-AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The LSC were capable of transferring leukaemia to secondary recipient mice when only four cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal haematopoietic stem cells was re-activated in LSC. LSC can thus be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukaemia self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Our findings define progression from normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal programme expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.","['Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Twomey, David', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Stubbs, Matthew C', 'Wang, Yingzi', 'Faber, Joerg', 'Levine, Jason E', 'Wang, Jing', 'Hahn, William C', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Krivtsov AV', 'Twomey D', 'Feng Z', 'Stubbs MC', 'Wang Y', 'Faber J', 'Levine JE', 'Wang J', 'Hahn WC', 'Gilliland DG', 'Golub TR', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature04980 [pii]', '10.1038/nature04980 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2006 Aug 17;442(7104):818-22. doi: 10.1038/nature04980.

These approaches have great impact and are of significant value. Nonetheless, mRNA is an intermediate in the process of protein synthesis and changes in mRNA expression do not reflect absolute or relative changes in protein levels. The mechanisms which translate mRNA to protein are highly regulated, and it remains unclear how the transcriptome reflects the functional state of the cell, as defined by its protein output. Large scale analyses of the proteome are now becoming a reality due to technical advances in protein arrays and mass spectrometry. Thus for the first time data on large numbers of mRNA transcripts and the levels of expression of their associated proteins is available in dynamic systems. Analysis of one such comparison, the transcriptome and proteome of primary haematopoietic stem cells, reveals post-translational regulation of the proteome in stem cell populations.

A defined event, termed ""angiogenic switch"" and characterized by an imbalance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, often marks interruption of the dormant state, thus triggering invasive tumor growth. In our current view, sustained angiogenesis is considered essential in promoting this transition. Recently, we demonstrated that co-administration of proliferation-arrested Kaposi's sarcoma cells or recombinant angiogenic factors interrupts dormancy of poorly angiogenic leukemia cells by providing a brief angiogenic burst. These findings indicate that even a transient angiogenic switch can prime progressive tumor growth and suggest that tumor angiogenesis is a process requiring a higher amount of angiogenic factors for its induction than maintenance.

In this study, we compared the effects of PTX on CASMC to apoptotic-prone HL60 leukemia cells and apoptotic-reluctant A549 lung cancer cells to assess cell survival mechanisms. In comparison to HL60 and A549 cells, CASMC had a shorter mitotic arrest and a lower mitotic index. While CASMC and A549 cells did not become apoptotic and displayed a multi-nucleated phenotype, HL60 cells showed prolonged mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis. CASMC exiting mitosis were arrested in G1 as MN tetraploid cells, with decreased levels of cyclin B1 and PCNA. CASMC remained metabolically active, becoming permanently arrested as evidenced by increased levels of beta-galactosidase activity. These cells did not demonstrate elevated levels of inflammatory markers.

Therefore, if chimeric gene products could be observed in situ, it would be advantageous not only for the correct diagnosis of each tumor but also to improve our understanding of the basis of tumorigenicity. Accordingly, it would seem that reverse transcriptase (RT) in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful and useful approach for the study of chimeric gene products in situ.

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the wild-type (wt) Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase collaborates with NUP98-HOX fusions (NUP98-HOXA10 and NUP98-HOXD13) to induce aggressive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used a mouse transplantation model to show their synergism in cotransduced bone marrow cells as well as in a cellular model of leukemic progression. Furthermore, our data support the finding that Meis1 overexpression leads to marked elevation in Flt3 transcription and extend it to the context of NUP98-HOX-induced leukemia. Together, these results support a multistep model where the synergism between NUP98-HOX and wt-Flt3 is the result of the ability of Flt3 to increase proliferation of myeloid progenitors blocked in differentiation by NUP98-HOX fusions and reveal a direct role for wt-Flt3 in the pathobiology of AML. Given the similarities in the leukemogenic role of native HOX and NUP98-fused HOX genes, our results underscore the clinical significance of the recurrent co-overexpression of wt-FLT3 and HOX in human leukemia and suggest that specific FLT3 inhibitors could be useful in treatment of HOX-induced AML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).","['Palmqvist, Lars', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Pineault, Nicolas', 'Abramovich, Carolina', 'Sly, Laura M', 'Krystal, Gerald', 'Wan, Adrian', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Palmqvist L', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Pineault N', 'Abramovich C', 'Sly LM', 'Krystal G', 'Wan A', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 11th Floor, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 1L3.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Transcription Factors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52759-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-12-007005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Aug 1;108(3):1030-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-12-007005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, HOXA5 has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer and shown to transactivate the p53 gene. CpG island methylation is a common mechanism of gene inactivation in tumour cells, but is rarely involved in control of cell-type-specific (CTS) expression in normal cells. However, here we demonstrate that HOXA5 is one of a small number of genes whose CTS expression pattern is controlled by CTS CpG island methylation in normal cells. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis identified novel patterns of histone modifications associated with DNA methylation of HOXA5. High levels of methylation of histone residues (lysine 9 and 36 of histone H3) previously associated with transcriptional repression were present in the unmethylated, actively transcribing state, and were then reduced following DNA methylation and gene inactivation. Alterations to the normal patterns of HOXA5 gene methylation were also observed in tumour cells. Quantitative analysis of HOXA5 methylation identified the presence of limited methylation in all of the breast, lung and ovarian tumours examined. However, methylation levels in these three tumour types were nearly always low and comparable with that detected in the corresponding normal tissue. In contrast, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples frequently (60% of samples) exhibited very high methylation levels, far greater than that seen in normal haematopoietic cells, suggesting a role for hypermethylation of HOXA5 in the development of AML, consistent with its previously identified role in haematopoietic differentiation.","['Strathdee, Gordon', 'Sim, Alyson', 'Soutar, Richard', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Brown, Robert']","['Strathdee G', 'Sim A', 'Soutar R', 'Holyoake TL', 'Brown R']","['Centre for Oncology and Applied Pharmacology, CR-UK Beatson Laboratories, G61 1BD UK. g.strathdee@beatson.gla.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/07/25 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgl133 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgl133 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2007 Feb;28(2):299-309. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgl133.

In this study, we investigated the apoptosis induced by NGEN via the activation of NF-kappaB and necrosis involving the loss of ATP in human promyeloleukemia HL-60 cells. Exposure to NGEN induced apoptosis dose-dependently up until 0.5mM, but not at 1mM as demonstrated by a quantitative analysis of nuclear morphological change and flow cytometric analysis. An extensive inhibitor for caspases, abolished the NGEN-induced apoptosis. The apoptosis-triggering concentration of NGEN was shown to markedly promote the activation of caspase-3, and slightly promote that of caspase-9, but had no effect on caspase-8. NGEN-induced apoptosis caused by induction of specific NF-kappaB-binding activity and involving the degradation of IkappaBalpha. Incubation with a high concentration of NGEN (1mM) reduced intracellular ATP levels, but no change was observed at lower concentrations. NGEN increased dose-dependently hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. This result indicates a common pathway to apoptosis and necrosis by NGEN. One of the mechanisms by NGEN-induced apoptosis may relate to the activation of NF-kappaB that correlates with degradation of IkappaBalpha. Induction of necrosis by NGEN suggests causing by intracellular ATP depletion and mitochondria dysfunctions.","['Kanno, Syu-Ichi', 'Tomizawa, Ayako', 'Ohtake, Takaharu', 'Koiwai, Kimiko', 'Ujibe, Mayuko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Tomizawa A', 'Ohtake T', 'Koiwai K', 'Ujibe M', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai 981-8558, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HN5425SBF2 (naringenin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Necrosis/*drug therapy']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/14 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(06)00197-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2006.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2006 Oct 10;166(2):131-9. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2006.06.005.

The basis for NK cell recognition and activation is due to a variety of receptors that bind to specific ligands on tumor cells and normal cells. Some of these receptors have the ability to inhibit NK cell function, and other receptors activate NK cell function. Therapeutic strategies for cancer therapy are being developed based on preventing NK cell inhibition or using NK cell receptors to activate NK cells or T cells. There are intriguing clinical data from studies of bone marrow transplantation that support the idea that preventing NK cell inhibition by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules can be a means to promote graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects and limit graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Experimental findings also support the blockade of NK cell inhibitory receptors as a way to protect against leukemia relapse. It may be possible to use our knowledge of NK cell activating receptors and their ligands to immunize patients with modified tumor cells to promote beneficial NK cell responses and development of host antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Finally, new data support the idea of using modified NK cell receptors as a means to target patients' T cells against their own tumor cells and induce long-term immunity against them. Tumors are essentially tissues that have overcome normal regulation mechanisms, and therefore the ability to distinguish normal cells from abnormal cells is a key part of selectively attacking tumor cells. NK cells have various receptor systems designed to recognize infected and abnormal cells. Understanding NK cell receptors and their recognition mechanisms provides new tools for the development of immunotherapies against cancer.","['Sentman, Charles L', 'Barber, Melissa A', 'Barber, Amorette', 'Zhang, Tong']","['Sentman CL', 'Barber MA', 'Barber A', 'Zhang T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",,['eng'],"['AI07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI51877/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Time Factors']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/09/30 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(06)95007-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-230X(06)95007-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2006;95:249-92. doi: 10.1016/S0065-230X(06)95007-6.,230,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that the class II HDAC family member HDAC7 is an efficient corepressor of the androgen receptor (AR). HDAC7 resided in the cytoplasm in the absence of AR or a cognate ligand, but hormone-occupancy of AR induced nuclear transfer of HDAC7. Nuclear colocalization pattern of AR and HDAC7 was dependent on the nature of the ligand. In the presence of testosterone, a portion of HDAC7 localized to pearl-like nuclear domains, whereas AR occupied with antagonistic ligands cyproterone acetate- or casodex (bicalutamide) recruited HDAC7 from these domains to colocalize with the receptor in speckles and nucleoplasm in a more complete fashion. Ectopic expression of PML-3 relieved the repressive effect of HDAC7 on AR function by sequestering HDAC7 to PML-3 domains. AR acetylation at Lys630/632/633 was not the target of HDAC7 repression, since repression of AR function was independent of these acetylation sites. Moreover, the deacetylase activity of HDAC7 was in part dispensable in the repression of AR function. In sum, our results identify HDAC7 as a novel AR corepressor whose subcellular and subnuclear compartmentalization can be regulated in an androgen-selective manner.","['Karvonen, Ulla', 'Janne, Olli A', 'Palvimo, Jorma J']","['Karvonen U', 'Janne OA', 'Palvimo JJ']","['Biomedicum Helsinki, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Helsinki, PO Box 63, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Androgens)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '4KM2BN5JHF (Cyproterone Acetate)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Androgens', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyproterone Acetate/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Androgen/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'TATA Box/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(06)00242-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 Oct 1;312(16):3165-83. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.06.018.

A recombinant bearing a hygromycin gene and a viral-like 30 (VL30) retrotransposon tagged with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene-based retrotransposition cassette was constructed and used for detection of retrotransposition events. Transfection of this recombinant produced retrotransposition events, detected both by EGFP fluorescence and PCR analysis, in hygromycin-selected clones of two established simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed mouse NIH3T3 cell lines but not in normal NIH3T3 cells. The retrotransposition potential of this recombinant, as a provirus, was studied in stably transfected NIH3T3 clones. Transfection of these clones with either a wild-type or a mutant LE1135T SV40 large T antigen gene, not expressing small t protein, induced retrotransposition events at high frequencies as measured by fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS). In addition, measuring retrotransposition frequencies over a period of nine days following infection with isolated SV40 particles, revealed that the frequency of retrotransposition was time-dependent and induced as early as 24 h, increasing exponentially to high levels (>10(-2) events per cell per generation) up to nine days post-infection. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a cloned MoMLV-reverse transcriptase gene also produced retrotransposition events and suggested that the large T antigen most likely acted through induction of expression of endogenous reverse transcriptase genes. Our results show a direct correlation between SV40-cell transformation and VL30 retrotransposition and provide for the first time strong evidence that SV40 large T antigen up-regulates the retrotransposition of VL30 elements.","['Noutsopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Vartholomatos, Georgios', 'Kolaitis, Nicolaos', 'Tzavaras, Theodore']","['Noutsopoulos D', 'Vartholomatos G', 'Kolaitis N', 'Tzavaras T']","['Laboratory of General Biology, Medical School, University of Ioannina, 45 110 Ioannina, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '3XQ2233B0B (Hygromycin B)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/genetics/*physiology', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hygromycin B/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Plasmids', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Retroelements/genetics/*physiology', '*Up-Regulation']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/07 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(06)00763-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2006 Aug 18;361(3):450-61. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.030.

Human MOLT4 T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cells that have acquired resistance to 6-MP or 6-thioguanine (6-TG) as a consequence of defective transport exhibit enhanced sensitivity to meMPR. HPLC-based analysis of the transport of meMPR revealed normal uptake of this compound by our thiopurine-resistant cell sublines, suggesting a route of transport distinct from that for 6-MP and 6-TG. Studies on the wild-type parental leukemic cells showed that adenosine, dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine inhibit uptake of meMPR to a significant extent, whereas Na+ ions have no influence on this process. Transfection of these leukemic cells with small interference RNA molecules targeting the gene encoding the first member of the family of equiliberative nucleoside transporters (ENT1) strongly reduced the initial rate of meMPR transport. Our resistant cell lines exhibited 30-52% reductions (p < 0.005) in their levels of mRNA encoding several proteins involved in de novo purine synthesis, i.e., aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase and guanine monophosphate synthetase. Consequently, the rate of de novo purine synthesis in these resistant sublines was decreased by 50%. Furthermore, the levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates in these cells were significantly lower than in the non-resistant parental cells. In combination, a reduced rate of de novo purine synthesis together with low levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates can explain the enhanced sensitivity of our thiopurine-resistant cell lines to meMPR. In this manner, meMPR bypasses the mechanisms of resistance to thiopurines and is even more cytotoxic towards resistant than towards wild-type cells.","['Fotoohi, Alan Kambiz', 'Wrabel, Anna', 'Moshfegh, Ali', 'Peterson, Curt', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Fotoohi AK', 'Wrabel A', 'Moshfegh A', 'Peterson C', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska Hospital and Institute, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.7.1.20 (Adenosine Kinase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mercaptopurine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Purines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Ribonucleotides/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Sodium/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology']",2006/07/25 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/07/25 09:00'],"['2006/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00366-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.06.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Sep 28;72(7):816-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.06.019.

The onset of this syndrome is usually 5-21 days after ATRA treatment when white blood cell counts are rising more than 10,000/cu.mm. The authors have reported a case of RAS. The patient was a 29-year-old man who had been working in a battery manufacturing factory for 7 years. He presented with easily bruising for one month. The initial blood test showed hematocrit of 36.2%, white blood cells count of 3,200/cu.mm with 28% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils and 50% promyelocytes and platelet of 20,000/cu.mm.

Bone marrow examination showed hypercellularity with abnormal promyelocytes of 95% and bone marrow cytogenetics was translocation of chromosome 15 and 17 [t (15;17)(q22;q12)]. The diagnosis was acute promyelocytic leukemia and the patient was treated with ATRA 45 mg/m2/day per oral starting on day 1 and intravenous idarubicin 10 mg/n2 on day 4, 5 and 6. On day 13, he had a body temperature of 39 degrees C and a dry cough. The white blood cells were rising to 7,400/cu.mm with 16% neutrophils. On day 18, he had oliguria, high grade fever, hypotension, cough with chest pain and white blood cells rose to 21,300/cu.mm with 65% neutrophils and rising of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Chest x-ray showed enlarged cardiac shadow with pleural effusion. Echocardiogram revealed moderate amount of pericardial effusion. The diagnosis of RAS was made and ATRA was withdrawn. Intravenous dexamethasone 4 mg every 6 hours and hemodialysis was started. The patient's symptoms improved dramatically and bone marrow examination was in complete remission. He was subsequently given cytarabine and idarubicin as consolidation.

Our Institution has developed a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for treatment of FN to assist the clinicians taking care of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate characteristics of FN, sources and causative agents of infection, applicability and effectiveness of the CPG, and factors that associated with response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with FN that had completed data from September, 2003 to May, 2005 were reviewed and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 148 FN episodes in 90 patients were analysed. The predominant underlying malignancy was acute leukemia. About 50% had absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 100 cells/mm3 at the beginning and at reassesment on day 3 of treatment. The causes of infection with microbiological confirmation was 25%. Urinary tract infection was the predominant source of infection and gram negative bacteria was the predominant causative agent. Sixty-two percents responded to initial treatment without changing of antibiotics. Of all episodes, 91.2% were able to complete treatment according to the CPG. The mortality rate was 1.4%. ANC of less than 100 cell/mm3 on day 3 of treatment was the significant risk factor for prolonged duration of fever and unresponsiveness to low risk regimen of antibiotics. ANC of less than 100 cell/mm3 on day 3, having hematologic malignancies, and recurrent fever were associated risks for the need for antifungal agent or referral to infectious diseases specialist or death. The pretreatment ANC more than 100 cells/mm3 was a significant predictor for the responsiveness to low risk regimen without recurrent fever. CONCLUSION: Our CPG could practically be applied in FN patients and resulted in low mortality rate.","['Sanpakit, Kleebsabai', 'Phuakpet, Kamon', 'Veerakul, Gavivann', 'Narkbunnam, Nattee', 'Chokephaibulkit, Kulkanya']","['Sanpakit K', 'Phuakpet K', 'Veerakul G', 'Narkbunnam N', 'Chokephaibulkit K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand. sisap@mahidol.ac.th']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology/microbiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Neutropenia/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2005 Nov;88 Suppl 8:S124-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to characterize kinase response to stimuli or drug treatment because regulatory phosphorylation events are largely transient changes affecting low abundance proteins. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for quantitative proteomics. By metabolically labeling proteins with light or heavy tyrosine, we are able to quantify the change in phosphorylation of BCR-ABL kinase and its substrates in response to drug treatment in human CML cells. In this study, we observed that BCR-ABL kinase is phosphorylated at tyrosines 393 and 644, and that SH2-domain containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP)-2 and downstream of kinase (Dok)-2 are phosphorylated at tyrosine 1135 and 299, respectively. Based on the relative intensity of isotopic peptide pairs, we demonstrate that the level of phosphorylation of BCR-ABL kinase as well as SHIP-2 and Dok-2 is reduced approximately 90% upon treatment with Imatinib, a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL kinase. Furthermore, proteins, such as SHIP-1, SH2-containing protein (SHC) and Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), are also regulated by Imatinib. These results demonstrate the simplicity and utility of SILAC as a method to quantify dynamic changes in phosphorylation at specific sites in response to stimuli or drug treatment in cell culture.","['Liang, Xiquan', 'Hajivandi, Mahbod', 'Veach, Darren', 'Wisniewski, David', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Resh, Marilyn D', 'Pope, R Marshall']","['Liang X', 'Hajivandi M', 'Veach D', 'Wisniewski D', 'Clarkson B', 'Resh MD', 'Pope RM']","['Proteomics, R&D Department, Invitrogen Life Science, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA. xiquan.l@invitrogen.com']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DOK2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-cbl)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Protein v-cbl/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/04 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200600109 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2006 Aug;6(16):4554-64. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200600109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three novel RUNX1 translocation partner genes on 1q21.2 (ZNF687), 1p35 (YTHDF2), and 4q31.3 (SH3D19) were identified using a panhandle polymerase chain reaction and the 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. The translocation events occurred between exons 3 and 7 of the RUNX1 gene. The partner gene breakpoints localized to the region in the partner gene with the highest Alu density, suggesting that Alus may contribute to the recombination events. Two out of three of the cases retained RUNX1's entire RUNT domain in the translocation, and RUNX1 mutations were absent in the fusion transcripts, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. SH3D19 encodes a cytoplasmic protein EBP known to suppress RAS-induced cellular transformation, which can be inhibited by nuclear recruitment. The t(4;21) created a hybrid RUNX1-EBP protein retaining RUNX1's DNA binding domain, which may result in nuclear localization of the chimeric protein and inhibition of EBP's RAS-suppressive functions.

METHODS: We collected all in- and outpatient costs during 5 years in 93 patients who had undergone ASCT in 1998 and 1999 at our unit. The inpatient costs included all those related to a patient from the first day of admission until discharge and then all costs of readmission in the Stockholm area. RESULTS: The total median cost of five posttransplant years was 139,414 (52,095-345,640) euros (euros) or 167,296 US dollars (the rate of 1 euro is approximately 1.2 US dollars). The costs were highest during the first year-median inpatient and outpatient costs 100,650 euros and 13,066 euros, respectively. The total costs during the first year were higher in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease grades III-IV (relative hazards [RH] 1.35, P = 0.003), bacteremia (RH 1.33, P = 0.005), veno-occlusive disease of the liver (RH 1.32, P = 0.005), prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; RH 1.31, P = 0.01), acute leukemia (RH 1.32, P = 0.008), and treatment in hospital instead of at home (RH 1.20, P < 0.07). During the early transplant period, a second transplantation (RH 1.28, P = 0.014) and hemorrhagic cystitis (HC; RH 1.24, P = 0.03) were also associated with higher costs. The total 5-year cost declined with longer survival rates (r = 0.4028, P < 0.001) and reduced intensity conditioning (RH 0.79, P=0.024).

Here we present an interesting case of possible interferon-induced reversible peripartum cardiomyopathy. The patient, with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, had been given interferon for 6 years. The therapy was discontinued when she became pregnant, and later she presented with symptoms of heart failure 6 weeks after her c-section. Interferon is an immunomodulating agent and used as an antiviral and an anticancer agent. Interferon-related dilated cardiomyopathy has been described as a rare side effect of the drug, the mechanism of which is unknown. There is compelling data supporting the fact that both peripartum cardiomyopathy and interferon-related cardiomyopathy are autoimmune disorders; so it is suggested that interferon therapy given in the past can have an additive effect in causing dilated cardiomyopathy. It is therefore advisable to follow closely those pregnant patients; who received interferon therapy in the past, for symptoms of cardiac failure, as there can be synergistic action between interferon and pregnancy causing dilated cardiomyopathy.","['Razaq, Wajeeha', 'Hyde, Phyllis']","['Razaq W', 'Hyde P']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fellow St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital, New York, NY 10019, USA. wrazaq@chpnet.org""]",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ther,American journal of therapeutics,9441347,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*etiology', 'Chest Pain/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*etiology']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['00045391-200607000-00015 [pii]', '10.1097/00045391-200607000-00015 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ther. 2006 Jul-Aug;13(4):373-5. doi: 10.1097/00045391-200607000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies require the development and implementation of reliable and large-scale genotyping methods. In this report, we introduce an efficient technique based on PCR-restriction fragment length sequence variation technique for the analysis of the -360CG and -201CT single-nucleotide sequence variations in the deoxycytidine kinase gene. METHODS: A multicapillary gel electrophoresis instrument was used for the size determination of the generated DNA fragments. A healthy Hungarian population of 100 individuals was investigated to determine allele and genotype frequencies for the 2 sequence variations of interest. RESULTS: We found that the occurrence of the minor allele is rather low, i.e., the frequency of both the -360G and -201T variants is 1%.

The plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) for FLT3 correlates with clinical activity in patients treated with CEP-701 and PKC412. Using the PIA assay, along with in vitro phosphorylation and cytotoxicity assays in leukemia cells, we compared PKC412 and its metabolite, CGP52421, with CEP-701. While both drugs could effectively inhibit FLT3 in vitro, CEP-701 was more cytotoxic to primary samples at comparable levels of FLT3 inhibition. PKC412 appears to be more selective than CEP-701 and therefore less effective at inducing cytotoxicity in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples in vitro. However, the PKC412 metabolite CGP52421 is less selective than its parent compound, PKC412, and is more cytotoxic against primary blast samples at comparable levels of FLT3 inhibition. The plasma inhibitory activity assay represents a useful correlative tool in the development of small-molecule inhibitors. Our application of this assay has revealed that the metabolite CGP52421 may contribute a significant portion of the antileukemia activity observed in patients receiving oral PKC412.

Multidrug resistance can be caused by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that function as drug efflux pumps. The majority of these proteins have not yet been examined in malignant diseases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A newly developed microarray for the simultaneous quantification of 38 ABC transporter genes and Taqman real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of ABC transporters in pediatric AML and healthy bone marrow. Small interfering RNA was used to verify the role of ABCA3 in drug resistance. RESULTS: Using the microarray, we identified four new ABC transporters, which were overexpressed in many AML samples compared with healthy bone marrow: ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCB2, and ABCC10. The overexpression of these four genes was verified by real-time PCR in 42 samples from children with AML and 18 samples of healthy bone marrow. The median expression of ABCA3 was three times higher in 21 patients who had failed to achieve remission after the first course of chemotherapy than in a well-matched group of 21 patients who had achieved remission at this stage (P = 0.023). Incubation of cell lines with a number of different cytostatic drugs induced an up-regulation of ABCA3. Down-regulation of ABCA3 by small interfering RNA sensitized cells to doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Our results show that ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCB2, and ABCC10 are overexpressed in childhood AML compared with healthy bone marrow. ABCA3 is the most likely transporter to cause drug resistance.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Gillet, Jean-Pierre', 'Sauerbrey, Axel', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Dawczynski, Kristin', 'Bertholet, Vincent', 'de Longueville, Francoise', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Remacle, Jose', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Steinbach D', 'Gillet JP', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Gruhn B', 'Dawczynski K', 'Bertholet V', 'de Longueville F', 'Zintl F', 'Remacle J', 'Efferth T']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Jena, Jena, Germany.

It can exert anti-tumor efficacy against a variety of cancers including leukemia. However, little is known about the effects of GLA on leukemia resistant to chemotherapy, emerging as a serious clinical problem. The present study tested GLA-induced apoptosis in K562/ADM multidrug-resistant (MDR) leukemic cells and investigated its possible mechanisms. Using cell viability, fluorescent staining of nuclei, flow cytometric Annexin V/PI double staining and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, we found that GLA could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis and secondary necrosis. The results showed that incubation with GLA concentrations of 10-60 microg/ml caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease of K562/ADM cell viability, and the IC50 value was 50.5 microg/ml at 24 h and 31.5 microg/ml at 48 h. Flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining assessed apoptosis, necrosis and viability. Typical apoptotic nuclei were shown by staining of K562/ADM cells with DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33342, characterized by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. On the other hand, after treated K562/ADM cells with 20 microg/ml GLA for 48 h and with 40 microg/ml GLA for 12 h, the LDH release significantly increased, indicated losses of plasma membrane integrity and presence of necrosis. Further, the inhibition of GLA-induced apoptosis by a pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) suggested the involvement of caspases. The increase of caspase-3 activity with GLA concentration confirmed its role in the process. The results also showed that the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was also significantly elevated, and antioxidant BHT could block GLA cytotoxity, indicating the cytotoxity induced by GLA may be due to lipid peroxidation.","['Kong, Xiuqin', 'Ge, Haitao', 'Hou, Lijuan', 'Shi, Limei', 'Liu, Zhili']","['Kong X', 'Ge H', 'Hou L', 'Shi L', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(06)00142-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2006.05.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2006 Aug 25;162(2):140-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.05.019.

Women (P = 0.03) and the young (P = 0.002) were preferentially affected. Accordingly, clinical comparisons were performed among three groups of female patients: those with AVT (group A; n = 17), a control group without AVT but closely matched to group A in terms of age and year of diagnosis (group B; n = 34), and all female patients without AVT (group C; n = 288). As expected from the consequences of AVT-associated portal hypertension and anticoagulant therapy, patients in group A experienced significantly higher rates of hemorrhage, palpable splenomegaly, and anemia. Unexpectedly, however, compared with group B, group A displayed both a higher conversion rate into myelofibrosis/acute leukemia (P = 0.0008) and a shorter median survival (116 vs. 156 months; P = 0.0012). Multivariable analysis including all female patients with ET identified AVT, along with advanced age, leukocytosis, and tobacco use, as an independent risk factor for inferior survival. Groups A, B, and C did not differ in either JAK2(V617F) mutational frequency or incidence of non-abdominal thrombosis. We conclude that AVT in ET is a marker of aggressive disease biology.","['Gangat, Naseema', 'Wolanskyj, Alexandra P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Gangat N', 'Wolanskyj AP', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Abdomen/*blood supply', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Thrombocytosis/epidemiology/*pathology']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH715 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00715.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Oct;77(4):327-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00715.x.

RESULTS: A diagnosis of AML-M2 was confirmed in both patients by morphological and immunophenotyping studies. Chromosome analysis in case no. 1 showed deletion 6p23 in 20% of metaphases whereas in case no. 2 the deletion 6p23 was present in 100% metaphases. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion as terminal in both cases. The DEK oncogene at 6p23 in both cases was found not to be deleted.

This study was designed to investigate associations between TK levels and other prognostic markers, in newly and previously diagnosed Binet stage A patients. Furthermore, the use of serum TK measurement to identify subcategories of disease within those defined by IgV(H) mutational status, gene usage and chromosomal aberrations was investigated. METHODS: Ninety-one CLL patients were enrolled. Serum TK levels were measured using a radioenzyme assay. IgV(H) mutational status and V(H) gene usage were determined using BIOMED-2 primers and protocol. Recurring chromosomal abnormalities were detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) determined CD38 and Zap-70 expression, respectively. RESULTS: Significantly higher serum TK levels were found in IgV(H) unmutated, compared with IgV(H) mutated, patients (P < 0.001). Elevated TK levels were also found in patients with CD38 and Zap-70 positivity (P = 0.004, P < 0.001, respectively), short lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) (P = 0.044) and poor or intermediate prognosis chromosomal aberrations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A TK level of >8.5 U/L best identified patients with progressive disease. Elevated TK levels could identify patients categorised, at diagnosis, into good prognosis subgroups by the various biological markers (mutated IgV(H), good prognosis chromosomal aberrations, Zap-70(-) and CD38(-)) who subsequently showed disease progression. Additionally, patients with V(H)3-21 gene usage showed high TK levels, irrespective of mutational status, and serum TK measurement retained predictive power as disease progressed in all subcategories studied.","['Matthews, Christine', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Morris, T C M', 'Kettle, Paul J', 'Drake, Mary B', 'Gilmore, William S', 'Alexander, H Denis']","['Matthews C', 'Catherwood MA', 'Morris TC', 'Kettle PJ', 'Drake MB', 'Gilmore WS', 'Alexander HD']","['Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, UK.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH707 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00707.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Oct;77(4):309-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00707.x.

Liposomal encapsulation makes daunorubicin (DNR) less sensitive to the efflux effect of P-glycoprotein (PGP), and in vitro data indicate that liposomal-encapsulated DNR (Daunoxome-DNX) is more toxic than DNR against ALL cell lines. In this study, we assessed the in vivo and in vitro efficacy and toxicity of DNX plus cytarabine (Ara-C) as reinduction chemotherapy in 25 relapsed ALL patients (pts). The expression of MDR-related proteins (PGP, MRP1 and LRP) was also analysed. Of the 25 pts, 12 were males and 13 females; median age was 32 yr (range 18-58). Six cases were ALL T and 19 ALL B; eight pts were Ph+ (32%), and nine Bcr-Abl+ (36%). The expression of MDR-related proteins, and DNR and DNX retention and induction of apoptosis in leukaemic cells were evaluated in all cases. Seventeen of 25 (68%) pts were at first relapse and eight (32%) at second or subsequent relapse. The DNX was given in a dose of 80 mg/m(2)/d (days 1-3) in 11/25 pts (44%) and in a dose of 100 mg/m(2)/d (days 1-3) in 14/25 pts (66%). In all pts, Ara-C was administered in a dose of 2 g/m(2) (days 1-5). Twenty pts (80%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and two (8%) entered a partial remission (PR) for an overall response (OR) rate of 88% (22/25), with a tolerable toxicity and without significant cardiotoxicity. Before the start of DNX therapy, 18/25 (72%) cases overexpressed at least one MDR-related protein compared with 9/25 (36%) cases with MDR overexpression at diagnosis (P = 0.01). Taking into account the small number of cases, the response rate was not affected by MDR expression and the in vitro results also showed a higher uptake and apoptotic cell death by DNX compared with DNR. Twelve pts subsequently underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (11 unrelated donor BMT, and one sibling BMT). The overall survival was 39% after 12 months. These data show the efficacy (OR rate 88% and CR rate 80%) of DNX plus Ara-C as reinduction therapy in very poor-risk ALL pts and the response rate seems not to be affected by MDR overexpression. Moreover, the high rate of remissions and the good clinical tolerance in heavily pretreated pts suggest a promising role of DNX in ALL chemotherapy regimens.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Simeone, Erica', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Michelutti A', 'Simeone E', 'Damiani D', 'Baccarani M', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical and Morphological Researches (DMMR), University of Udine, Udine, Italy. candoni.a@tiscali.it']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH708 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00708.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Oct;77(4):293-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00708.x.

METHODS: By analyzing 125 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, we investigated clinical and laboratory features of leukemia-associated DIC, and determined the validity of the two established criteria. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (29%) were diagnosed with DIC according to expert opinion, a method regarded as the de facto gold standard. Leukemia-associated DIC is characterized by rare manifestation of organ failure because of thrombosis and no relevance of the platelet count for the diagnosis. The results of receiver operating characteristics analysis favored fibrin degradation product (FDP) rather than D-dimer as the fibrin-related marker test. Although prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, and serum FDP levels were significantly different for patients with and without DIC, multivariate analysis identified FDP levels to be the only factor associated with DIC diagnosis. The cut-off level of 15 microg/mL for FDP was found to be the most effective to differentiate DIC from non-DIC, resulting in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. The diagnostic results for our patients produced with this FDP-based system were at least comparable with or superior to those obtained with the two currently available scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an FDP-based criterion may be applicable for the diagnosis of leukemia-associated DIC. Although it appears to be simple and practicable enough for clinical use, prospective validation of this criterion is needed.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Matsushita, Tadashi', 'Suzuki, Momoko', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Yamamoto, Koji', 'Kinoshita, Tomohiro', 'Kojima, Tetsuhito', 'Saito, Hidehiko', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Matsushita T', 'Suzuki M', 'Kiyoi H', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kinoshita T', 'Kojima T', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. myanada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH711 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00711.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Oct;77(4):282-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00711.x.

METHODS: BALB/c nu/nu mice, pretreated by splenectomy, cytoxan intraperitoneal injection, and sublethal irradiation, were transplanted intravenously with human monocytic leukemic cell line SHI-1. The leukemic cells engrafted in the mice were traced by RT-PCR, histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry and FCM. RESULT: After engraftment of SHI-1 cells in SCI-nu/nu mice, multiple organs were involved and green solid neoplasms were formed in some organs. Paralysis was developed in some mice at both of the rear legs. Histopathological examination found that vertebral and skull bone marrow were replaced by leukemic cells. Leukemic cells penetrated to the surface of vertebrae, forming neoplasm, and entering to the subdural space, but seldom involving in the spinal parenchyma. In the brain, leukemic cells filled in the subdural space and pia-arachnoid, covered the surface of cerebrum, cerebellum and along the virchow-robin space on the surface of pia mater, eventually invading into the brain parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: SHI-1 cells could engraft in the SCI-nu/nu mice, creating an efficient and reproducible experimental model of central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) and multiorgan infiltration.

We have analysed NRM in a cohort of 1,482 adult patients who received ASCT in 1990-2003 in six Finnish transplant centres. The most common diagnoses included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n = 542), multiple myeloma (MM) (n = 528), breast cancer (n = 132); Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (n = 86) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 63). Until September 2005, 646 patients (44%) have died. Late NRM was observed in 68 patients (4.6% of ASCT recipients; 11% of all deaths). There were 38 males and 30 females with a median age of 58 yr (20-69) at the time of ASCT. The median time to NRM was 27 months from ASCT (3-112). The risk of NRM was highest in patients with CLL (9.5%) and those with HL (8.1%) followed by MM and NHL (4.9% and 4.8%, respectively). The risk of late NRM was comparable in patients who received total body irradiation (TBI) and those who received chemotherapy-only regimens (6.7% vs. 4.3%). Another malignancy was the most common cause of late NRM (24 patients, 35% of late NRM). Twelve patients (0.8% of ASCT recipients) have died due to secondary haematological malignancy. Altogether 22 patients (32% of late NRM) died from infectious causes. Malignancies and late infections are important causes of NRM after ASCT. These facts point out the importance of prolonged follow-up in ASCT recipients.","['Jantunen, E', 'Itala, M', 'Siitonen, T', 'Koivunen, E', 'Leppa, S', 'Juvonen, E', 'Kuittinen, O', 'Lehtinen, T', 'Koistinen, P', 'Nyman, H', 'Nousiainen, T', 'Volin, L', 'Remes, K']","['Jantunen E', 'Itala M', 'Siitonen T', 'Koivunen E', 'Leppa S', 'Juvonen E', 'Kuittinen O', 'Lehtinen T', 'Koistinen P', 'Nyman H', 'Nousiainen T', 'Volin L', 'Remes K']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. esa.jantunen@kuh.fi']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/surgery', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infections/mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/surgery', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*surgery', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/mortality', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Postoperative Complications/*mortality', 'Transplantation Conditioning/mortality', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH685 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00685.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Aug;77(2):114-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00685.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a third of patients treated with DCF do not achieve a complete remission (CR) and many of them tend to relapse, we evaluated the potential role of IFN-alpha, randomly administered after DCF, in increasing the number of patients attaining CR and/or duration of CR. METHODS: From March 1997 to December 2000, 167 previously untreated HCL patients, from 37 Italian institutions, were enrolled in the study. A total of 138 males and 29 females, with a median age of 55 yr were included in the study. All patients received six courses of DCF 4 mg/m(2) i.v. every other week and then two additional courses once a month. Complete and partial responders were randomly assigned to receive or not receive IFN-alpha at a dose of 3 MU s.c. three times a week for 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients enrolled in the study, 145 (86.8%) obtained a CR or a partial remission (PR) and were therefore suitable for randomization. One hundred and thirty-five patients were successively randomized to receive IFN-alpha (63 cases; arm A) or not (72 cases; arm B). Progression of disease was observed in eight (arm A) and 12 (arm B) patients with a median time of 27.8 and 26.9 months, respectively. As far as the improvement in response was concerned, no significant difference in the two subgroups was observed. In fact, five patients in arm A and six patients in arm B showing a good PR at the end of DCF therapy, subsequently attained a late CR. CONCLUSIONS: From our data there does not appear to be any significant role for IFN-alpha in improving the proportion and the duration of CR in HCL patients previously treated with DCF.","['Marotta, Giuseppe', 'Frassoldati, Antonio', 'Zinzani, Pierluigi', 'Annino, Luciana', 'Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Lenoci, Mariapia', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Foa, Robin', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Marotta G', 'Frassoldati A', 'Zinzani P', 'Annino L', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Lenoci M', 'Federico M', 'Foa R', 'Lauria F']","['Hematology Unit, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['Italian Cooperative group for HCL (ICGHCL)'],['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH670 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00670.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Aug;77(2):109-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00670.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence dictates the need for anticoagulant prophylaxis. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) are independent of AT for effect and may thus have advantages in this population. The objective of this study was to determine the interaction of an AT deficiency with the anticoagulant effects of a DTI and a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Plasma samples from children with ALL were pooled (mean AT 0.53 U/ml). LMWH 0.3 and 0.7 U/ml or melagatran 0.3 and 0.5 micromol/l were added to the pools, then divided and AT was added back to one aliquot. In additional experiments, AT was added to AT immuno-depleted plasma. Endogenous thrombin generation capacity (ETGC) was assessed by the continuous method. In plasma with LMWH, there was a 66-88% decrease in ETGC in AT-normalised samples compared with neat. Conversely, no significant difference in ETGC with or without AT added for melagatran was seen. Experiments with AT-depleted plasma showed no effect of AT level on anticoagulant activity of DTI, but a significant relationship for LMWH. By contrast to LMWH, DTI provides a consistent anticoagulant response independent of AT levels in children with AT deficiency.","['Kuhle, Stefan', 'Lau, Alice', 'Bajzar, Laszlo', 'Vegh, Patsy', 'Halton, Jacqueline', 'Cherrick, Irene', 'Anderson, Ron', 'Desai, Sunil', 'McCusker, Patricia', 'Wu, John', 'Abshire, Thomas', 'Mahoney, Donald', 'Mitchell, Lesley']","['Kuhle S', 'Lau A', 'Bajzar L', 'Vegh P', 'Halton J', 'Cherrick I', 'Anderson R', 'Desai S', 'McCusker P', 'Wu J', 'Abshire T', 'Mahoney D', 'Mitchell L']","[""Pediatric Thrombosis Program, Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada.""]",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Azetidines)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)', '2A9QP32MD4 (melagatran)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antithrombin III Deficiency/blood/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Antithrombins/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azetidines/*therapeutic use', 'Benzylamines/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linear Models', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Thrombin/metabolism']",2006/07/22 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6209 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06209.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Sep;134(5):526-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06209.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeast orthologues of CHMPs, including an ESCRT-III component Snf7, are required for the sorting of cargo proteins to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. We have characterized a novel human ESCRT-III-related protein, designated CHMP7, which consists of 453 amino acid residues. CHMP7 contains an SNF7 domain and a distantly SNF7-related domain in its C-terminal half and N-terminal half respectively. Among the ten CHMP proteins classified previously in six subfamilies (CHMP1-CHMP6), the C-terminal SNF7 domain of CHMP7 is most similar to the SNF7 domain of CHMP6, which associates with CHMP4 proteins and EAP20, a component of ESCRT-II. Pull-down assays using lysates of HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney) cells that overexpressed Strep-tagged CHMP7 and GFP (green fluorescent protein)-fused CHMP4b (also named Shax1) revealed a positive interaction between the C-terminal half of CHMP7 and CHMP4b. However, interaction was not observed between CHMP7 and EAP20. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that FLAG-CHMP7 is distributed in HeLa cells diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, but with some accumulation, especially in the perinuclear area. The distribution of FLAG-CHMP7 was altered to a cytoplasmic punctate pattern by overexpression of either CHMP4b-GFP or GFP-Vps4B(E235Q), a dominant-negative mutant of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) Vps4B, and partially co-localized with them.

The underlying molecular mechanisms are widely unknown. We investigated expression and possible mechanisms of regulation of different matrix-metalloproteases (MMPs) by EVT in placental bed biopsies from patients with early onset preeclampsia combined with IUGR and healthy pregnant women. Expression of MMP-3 and MMP-7 by EVT was markedly reduced in preeclamptic patients, especially close to spiral arteries. In contrast to healthy pregnancies these cells strongly expressed the receptor for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF is known to suppress MMP-expression and is produced by uterine natural killer (uNK) cells which we found to be present in higher concentrations in the placental bed of preeclamptic patients, and accumulating aside the spiral arteries. We speculate that in preeclampsia a maternal immune cell network accumulating and interfering in the placental bed leads to an altered cytokine environment, resulting in disturbed trophoblast cell function such as impaired MMP expression and reduced invasiveness.","['Reister, Frank', 'Kingdom, John C P', 'Ruck, Peter', 'Marzusch, Klaus', 'Heyl, Wolfgang', 'Pauer, Uli', 'Kaufmann, Peter', 'Rath, Werner', 'Huppertz, Berthold']","['Reister F', 'Kingdom JC', 'Ruck P', 'Marzusch K', 'Heyl W', 'Pauer U', 'Kaufmann P', 'Rath W', 'Huppertz B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany. frankreister@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,J Perinat Med,Journal of perinatal medicine,0361031,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (MMP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (MMP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 7)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Arteries/enzymology/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Placenta/blood supply', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*enzymology/pathology']",2006/07/22 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/07/22 09:00'],"['2006/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/JPM.2006.052 [doi]'],ppublish,J Perinat Med. 2006;34(4):272-9. doi: 10.1515/JPM.2006.052.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Children without Down syndrome or acute promyelocytic leukemia who were newly diagnosed with primary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M6 or M7 were compared to children with de novo AML M0-M5. All children were entered on the Children's Cancer Group therapeutic research study CCG 2891. RESULTS: The presentation and outcomes of the 132 children diagnosed with MDS (60 children), AML FAB M6 (19 children), or AML FAB M7 (53 children) were similar. Children with AML FAB M7 were diagnosed at a significantly younger age (P = 0.001). Children with MDS, M6, or M7 had significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (P = 0.001), lower peripheral blast counts (P < 0.001), and an increased frequency of -7/7q- (P = 0.003) at presentation. All three groups had significantly inferior overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and event free survival (P < 0.001) compared with the 748 children diagnosed with AML FAB M0-M5 when assessed from entry on study. This poor survival was largely attributable to induction death and failure. However, when assessed from successful completion of induction therapy, the 5-year OS (P = 0.090)(49.1 vs. 56.9%) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.113)(38.0 vs. 46.3%) therapy were not significantly different from other children with AML.

We performed a pilot study incorporating oral and 24-hr continuous IV infusion (CIVI) TG in children with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL. PROCEDURE: Children with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL (age 1-10 years, WBC<50 k) were eligible. Multi-agent chemotherapy was patterned after the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 105 trial, with the addition of CIVI-TG (480 mg/m2) during consolidation, interim maintenance and maintenance, and substitution of oral TG (60 mg/m2/day) for oral MP during maintenance. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (31 female), median age 4.3 years, were enrolled. At 8 years, the relapse-free and overall survival probabilities were 83% and 88%. There were no CNS relapses. Six patients (five males) experienced reversible veno-occlusive disease (VOD) while receiving oral TG, and the study was amended to discontinue TG, changing all patients to oral MP. Red cell TG nucleotide concentrations during oral TG averaged 95 ng (570 pmol)/8x10(8) RBC, greater than concentrations reported with oral MP. CONCLUSION: Although the absence of CNS relapses in this pilot study suggests that TG may contribute to the prevention of CNS recurrences, the development of VOD negatively impacts the risk:benefit ratio of substituting TG for MP.","['Jacobs, Shana S', 'Stork, Linda C', 'Bostrom, Bruce C', 'Hutchinson, Ray', 'Holcenberg, John', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Erdmann, Gary', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Balis, Frank M', 'Adamson, Peter C']","['Jacobs SS', 'Stork LC', 'Bostrom BC', 'Hutchinson R', 'Holcenberg J', 'Reaman GH', 'Erdmann G', 'Franklin J', 'Neglia JP', 'Steinberg SM', 'Balis FM', 'Adamson PC']","[""Children's National Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, USA. jacobss@mail.nih.gov""]","[""Children's Oncology Group"", 'National Cancer Institute']",['eng'],"['M01 RR00069/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2006/07/21 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20964 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Sep;49(3):250-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20964.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, none was able to show a survival advantage. OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is any advantage of purine antagonists compared to alkylating agents (alone or in combination) in the treatment of patients with previously untreated B-CLL. SEARCH STRATEGY: Medical databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE), conference proceedings and internet-based trial registers were searched electronically and/or by hand (1990-2003). All references were checked for further trial information. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing purine antagonists as single agents with alkylator-based regimens in patients with previously untreated B-CLL were included. We included full-text and abstract publications as well as unpublished data. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Missing data were obtained from original authors. Endpoints included overall survival, overall response rate, rate of complete remissions, progression-free survival, treatment-related morbidity and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials with 1838 randomised patients were included. There is some evidence for improved overall survival after treatment with purine antagonists compared to alkylators, but statistical significance was not reached (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.78-1.01], 4 trials, n=1638). However, the relative risk for achieving an overall response (RR 1.22 [95% CI 1.13-1.31], 5 trials, n=1751) and complete remission (RR 1.94 [95% CI 1.65-2.28], 5 trials, n=1751) was significantly higher, resulting in a longer progression-free survival (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.61-0.82], 4 trials, n=1638). Incidence of grade III/IV infections was significantly higher in patients receiving treatment with purine antagonists (RR 1.83 [95% 1.30-2.58], 4 trials, n=1620). There was no significant difference concerning the relative risk for grade III/IV neutropenia (RR 1.14 [95% CI 0.98-1.34], 4 trials, n=1620) and therapy-related mortality (RR 0.94 [95% CI 0.45-1.95]). Overall incidence of hemolytic anemia was low, but significantly increased in the purine antagonist group (RR 3.36 [95% CI 1.27-8.91], 3 trials, n=1258). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite significantly increased overall response and complete remission rates and longer progression-free survival with first-line treatment of B-CLL patients with single-agent purine antagonists, we were not able to detect a statistically significant improvement of overall survival compared to alkylator-based regimens. Furthermore, the use of purine antagonists also augments the risk for grade III/IV infections and hemolytic anemia.","['Steurer, M', 'Pall, G', 'Richards, S', 'Schwarzer, G', 'Bohlius, J', 'Greil, R']","['Steurer M', 'Pall G', 'Richards S', 'Schwarzer G', 'Bohlius J', 'Greil R']","['Innsbruck University Hospital, Division of Haematology & Oncology, Anichstrasse 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. michael.steurer@uibk.ac.at']",,['eng'],['U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD004270.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006 Jul 19;(3):CD004270. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD004270.pub2.,39,20060719,,,PMC8407449,,,,,,,,,

However, the initial response to imatinib is often followed by the recurrence of a resistant form of the disease, which is major obstacle to many therapeutic modalities. The aim of this study was to identify the gene expression signatures that confer resistance to imatinib. A series of four resistant K562 sublines was established with different imatinib dosage (200, 400, 600 and 800 nM) and analyzed using microarray technology. The transcripts of the genes showing universal or dose-dependent expression changes across the resistant sublines were identified. The gene sets associated with the imatinib-resistance were also identified using gene set enrichment analysis. In the resistant K562 sublines, the transcription- and apoptosis-related expression signatures were upregulated, whereas those related to the protein and energy metabolism were downregulated. Several genes identified in this study such as IGF1 and RAB11A have the potential to become surrogate markers useful in a clinical evaluation of imatinib-resistant patients without BCR-ABL mutation. The expression signatures identified in this study provide insights into the mechanism of imatinib-resistance and are expected to facilitate the development of an effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.","['Chung, Y-J', 'Kim, T-M', 'Kim, D-W', 'Namkoong, H', 'Kim, H K', 'Ha, S-A', 'Kim, S', 'Shin, S M', 'Kim, J-H', 'Lee, Y-J', 'Kang, H-M', 'Kim, J W']","['Chung YJ', 'Kim TM', 'Kim DW', 'Namkoong H', 'Kim HK', 'Ha SA', 'Kim S', 'Shin SM', 'Kim JH', 'Lee YJ', 'Kang HM', 'Kim JW']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404310 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404310 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1542-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404310.

However, the reason for high c-Myc protein levels in most cases is unknown. We examined whether aberrant protein stabilization could be a mechanism of c-Myc overexpression in leukemia cell lines and in primary bone marrow samples from pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. We found that c-Myc protein half-life was prolonged in the majority of leukemia cell lines and bone marrow samples tested. There were no mutations in the c-myc gene in any of the leukemia cell lines that could account for increased c-Myc stability. However, abnormal phosphorylation at two conserved sites, Threonine 58 and Serine 62, was observed in leukemia cell lines with stabilized c-Myc. Moreover, stabilized c-Myc from the ALL cell lines showed decreased affinity for glycogen synthase kinase3beta, the kinase that phosphorylates c-Myc at Threonine 58 and facilitates its degradation. These findings reveal that deregulation of the c-Myc degradation pathway controlled by Serine 62 and Threonine 58 phosphorylation is a novel mechanism for increased expression of a potent oncoprotein known to be involved in hematopoietic malignancies.","['Malempati, S', 'Tibbitts, D', 'Cunningham, M', 'Akkari, Y', 'Olson, S', 'Fan, G', 'Sears, R C']","['Malempati S', 'Tibbitts D', 'Cunningham M', 'Akkari Y', 'Olson S', 'Fan G', 'Sears RC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K01 CA086957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA086957-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100855/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100855-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Amplification', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404317 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404317 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1572-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404317.

We screened for mutations 171 patients failing imatinib therapy. Sixty-six mutations in 23 amino acids were identified in 62 (36%) patients not responding to imatinib. Phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) mutations were the most frequent (n=24; 36%). By multivariate analysis, factors associated with development of mutations were older age (P=0.026) prior interferon therapy (P=0.026), and accelerated phase or blast phase at time of imatinib failure (P=0.001). After a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 4-68 months) from the start of imatinib therapy, seven patients with non-P-loop and two with P-loop mutation died. By multivariate analysis, development of clonal evolution and higher percentage of peripheral blood basophils were associated with worse survival from the time of imatinib failure. Mutation status had no impact on survival. When survival was measured from the time therapy started, non-P-loop mutations together with duration of response and transformation at the time of failure to imatinib were associated with shorter survival. In conclusion, P-loop mutations were not associated with poor outcome, suggesting that the prognosis of patients who fail imatinib is multifactorial.","['Jabbour, E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Jones, D', 'Talpaz, M', 'Bekele, N', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Zhou, X', 'Luthra, R', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Giles, F', 'Rios, M B', 'Verstovsek, S', 'Cortes, J']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jones D', 'Talpaz M', 'Bekele N', ""O'Brien S"", 'Zhou X', 'Luthra R', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Giles F', 'Rios MB', 'Verstovsek S', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Basophils/pathology', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404318 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404318 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1767-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404318.

In this work, we investigated the effect of adhesion to fibronectin on the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (U937 and KG1a) and CD34+ normal or leukemic primary cells. We observed an increased rate of proliferation of AML cells when adhered to fibronectin, concomitant with accelerated S-phase entry and accumulation of CDC25A. Conversely, normal CD34+ cell proliferation was decreased by adhesion to fibronectin with a concomitant drop in CDC25A expression. Importantly, we showed that both small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated CDC25A down-regulation and a recently developed CDC25 pharmacologic inhibitor impaired this adhesion-dependent proliferation, establishing a functional link between CDC25A accumulation and adhesion-dependent proliferation in leukemic cells. CDC25A accumulation was found only slightly dependent on transcriptional regulation and essentially due to modifications of the proteasomal degradation of the protein as shown using proteasome inhibitors and reverse transcription-PCR. Interestingly, CDC25A regulation was Chk1 dependent in these cells as suggested by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of this protein. Finally, we identified activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway as an adhesion-dependent regulation mechanism of CDC25A protein expression. Altogether, our data show that in leukemic cells adhesion to fibronectin increases CDC25A expression through proteasome- and Chk1-dependent mechanisms, resulting in enhanced proliferation. They also suggest that these adhesion-dependent proliferation properties of hematopoietic cells may be modified during leukemogenesis.","['Fernandez-Vidal, Anne', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Didier, Christine', 'Betous, Remy', 'De Toni, Fabienne', 'Prade-Houdellier, Nais', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Contour-Galcera, Marie-Odile', 'Prevost, Gregoire P', 'Ducommun, Bernard', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Racaud-Sultan, Claire', 'Manenti, Stephane']","['Fernandez-Vidal A', 'Ysebaert L', 'Didier C', 'Betous R', 'De Toni F', 'Prade-Houdellier N', 'Demur C', 'Contour-Galcera MO', 'Prevost GP', 'Ducommun B', 'Payrastre B', 'Racaud-Sultan C', 'Manenti S']","['Centre de Physiopathologie Toulouse-Purpan, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U563-IFR30, Departement ""Oncogenese et Signalisation dans les cellules hematopoietiques,"" Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/14/7128 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2552 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 15;66(14):7128-35. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2552.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While neonatal disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria as well as being underweight account for most of the child deaths worldwide, children's health discussions in Europe and the USA focus on other issues such as asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders, male genital malformations, and childhood cancer. There is clear evidence of increasing rates of asthma in various countries during the last decades, although rates in some countries may now have stabilised or even decline as recent UK data indicate. Although an increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and attention deficit disorder has frequently been discussed, the limited data in this field does not justify such a conclusion. While geographic heterogeneity regarding reproductive outcomes is apparent, global trends have not been identified. Interpretation of the available information on asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders and reproductive outcomes is hampered by inconstant diagnostic criteria over place and time and the lack of good and comprehensive population-based surveillance data, which makes it impossible to ascertain trends in actual disease frequency. Data indicate that developed countries have a gradually increasing incidence in leukaemia with a corresponding drop in the incidence of lymphoma. Increases in brain tumour frequency may be related to the development and wide application of new diagnostic capabilities, rather than a true change in the incidence of malignant disease. With a better prognosis for childhood cancer survival, secondary cancers following chemotherapy appear to be increasing. A wide range of environmental factors is thought to have an impact on children's health. These factors include nutrition (protein, vitamins, antioxidants), lifestyle and behaviour choices such as tobacco and alcohol use, parental health, socio-economic status, choice of living environment (urban versus rural, etc.), and parent-sibling behaviour. From the available data, no general conclusions on the contribution of specific chemicals can be drawn.","['Pallapies, Dirk']",['Pallapies D'],"['BASF Aktiengesellschaft, GOA/CP-H308, D-67056 Ludwigshafen, Germany. dirk.pallapies@basf.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Asthma/mortality', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/epidemiology', 'Autistic Disorder/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child Mortality/*trends', 'Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Genitalia, Male/abnormalities', 'Humans', 'Learning Disabilities/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/mortality']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(06)00148-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Sep 28;608(2):100-11. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.03.007.

We measured the accumulation of Rhodamine 123 (Rho123), a substrate of P-gp, into a drug sensitive and a drug resistant strain of the human leukemia cell line K562, as function of Rho123 concentration. With the aid of a mathematical transformation, we used the accumulation of Rho123 into the sensitive cells as a surrogate measure for the internal concentration of the probe in the resistant cells, and were thus able to measure the kinetic parameters of drug efflux pumping by P-gp. Drug pumping was half-saturated at an external Rho123 concentration of 7.2E-06+/-1.1E-06 M, and displayed a co-operative behaviour with a Hill number of 1.94+/-0.32. Verapamil could be shown to inhibit Rho123 efflux uncompetitively.","['Wang, Yulin', 'Hao, DaCheng', 'Stein, Wilfred D', 'Yang, Ling']","['Wang Y', 'Hao D', 'Stein WD', 'Yang L']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Resource Discovery, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Algorithms', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Rhodamine 123/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(06)00214-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006 Oct;1758(10):1671-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.06.004.

The outcome of this condition in children depends on the etiology and the duration of convulsion. There is no report of this condition in Thai children. OBJECTIVE: To study the etiology, clinical course and outcome in children with convulsive SE in a referral hospital in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of infants and children aged between one month and 15 years with the diagnosis of SE who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok from January 1st, 1981 to December 31st, 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic data, types of seizure, duration of seizure, underlying diseases, precipitating factors, laboratory results, treatment, clinical course and outcomes were collected for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (15 boys, 17 girls) whose ages ranged from 2 months to 14.4 years (mean 6.5 years) were included Twenty-four patients had underlying epilepsy. Twelve patients had prior diagnosis of symptomatic and idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy. Seven patients had acute insults to the central nervous system leading to SE. One patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with SE without association to either the underlying disease or the treatment. Fever with or without specific infection was the most common precipitating factor observed in these patients. The mean duration of SE was 64.4 minutes. The mean duration from initiation of treatment to the cessation of seizure was 41.4 minutes. Twelve patients were lost to follow up. Of the two patients who died, one had severe infection and the other had renal failure. Twelve patients had severe neurological deficits and six had mild neurological deficits. Among the thirteen patients who had > or = 1 hour of convulsion, eleven had severe neurological deficits or died. CONCLUSION: Infantile SE occurred more frequently in children with pre-existing epilepsy or neurological disorder Acute febrile illness and infection were the most common precipitating causes in the present study. Early recognition and treatment of fever and infection in conjunction with prompt and appropriate termination of seizure in epileptic children may prevent the occurrence of SE and its morbidity.","['Visudtibhan, Anannit', 'Limhirun, Janjira', 'Chiemchanya, Surang', 'Visudhiphan, Pongsakdi']","['Visudtibhan A', 'Limhirun J', 'Chiemchanya S', 'Visudhiphan P']","['Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. raavs@mahidol.ac.th']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Community', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Seizures/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality', 'Status Epilepticus/drug therapy/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Thailand', '*Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/21 09:00,2006/09/27 09:00,['2006/07/21 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2006 Jun;89(6):803-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After at least 8 months of exposure, the rate of apoptosis in the cells became very low and the resultant subline was designated MT-2Rst. The MT-2Rst cells were characterized by (i) enhanced expression of bcl-2, with regain of apoptosis-sensitivity by reduction of bcl-2 by siRNA, (ii) excess IL-10 secretion and expression, and (iii) activation of STAT3 that was inhibited by PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases. These results suggested that the contact between cells and asbestos may affect the human immune system and trigger a cascade of biological events such as activation of Src family kinases, enhancement of IL-10 expression, STAT3 activation and Bcl-2 overexpression. This speculation was partially confirmed by the detection of elevated bcl-2 expression levels in CD4 + peripheral blood T cells from patients with MM compared with those from patients with ASB or healthy donors.

Previous studies revealed that the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members Bax or Bid play important roles in apoptotic signal transduction between cat D and mitochondria. Here, we show that glucosamine sulfate (GS) inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells in vitro. GS interfered with the maturation of cat D. Activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, release of cyt c, and downregulation of Bcl-xL accompanied GS-induced apoptosis, and these processes were inhibited by the cat D inhibitor pepstatin A.

Histamine is an essential mediator and marker of basophils and is highly up-regulated in CML. We examined the biochemical basis of histamine synthesis in CML cells. The CML-specific oncoprotein BCR/ABL was found to promote expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and synthesis of histamine in Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib (STI571) and nilotinib (AMN107) decreased histamine levels and HDC mRNA expression in BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cells, in the CML-derived basophil cell line KU812, and in primary CML cells. Synthesis of histamine was found to be restricted to the basophil compartment of the CML clone and to depend on signaling through the PI3-kinase pathway. CML cells also expressed histamine receptors (HRs), including HR-1, HR-2, HR-4, and histamine-binding CYP450 isoenzymes which also serve as targets of HR antagonists. The HR-1 antagonists loratadine and terfenadine, which bind to CYP450, were found to counteract proliferation of CML cells, whereas no growth inhibition was observed with the HR-1 antagonist fexofenadine which is not targeted or metabolized by CYP450. Moreover, DPPE, an inhibitor of histamine-binding CYP450 isoenzymes, produced growth inhibition in CML cells. Together, these data show that BCR/ABL promotes histamine production in CML cells and that certain HR-targeting drugs exert antileukemic effects on CML cells.","['Aichberger, Karl J', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Vales, Anja', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Bilban, Martin', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Florian, Stefan', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Agis, Hermine', 'Falus, Andras', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Valent, Peter']","['Aichberger KJ', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Vales A', 'Krauth MT', 'Gleixner KV', 'Bilban M', 'Esterbauer H', 'Sonneck K', 'Florian S', 'Derdak S', 'Pickl WF', 'Agis H', 'Falus A', 'Sillaber C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, AKH-Wien, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histamine/*biosynthesis', 'Histamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Histamine/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/07/20 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52344-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-12-028456 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Nov 15;108(10):3538-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-12-028456.

Erythroid and myeloid cell production in cultures was dramatically decreased in TAL1-directed shRNA-expressing cells, whereas lymphoid B-cell development was normal. These results confirm the role of TAL1 in the erythroid compartment and show TLA1's implication in the function of myeloid committed progenitors. Moreover, long-term cultures and transplantation of TAL1-directed shRNA-expressing CD34+ cells into irradiated nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice led to dramatically low levels of human cells of all lineages including the B-lymphoid lineage, strongly suggesting that TAL1 has a role in the early commitment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in humans.

Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress (OS) plays an important role in a variety of cell death mechanisms. To investigate the role of OS in ER stress, we measured OS in response to three ER stress agents: econazole (Ec), which stimulates ER Ca2+ release and blocks Ca2+ influx; thapsigargin (Tg), a sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor that releases ER Ca2+ and stimulates Ca2+ influx; and tunicamycin (Tu), a glycosylation inhibitor that causes protein accumulation in the ER. Ec, but not Tg or Tu, caused a rapid increase in OS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed within mitochondria immediately after exposure to Ec. Furthermore, Ec hyperpolarized the mitochondrial membrane and inhibited adenine nucleotide transport in cell-free mitochondria, suggesting a mitochondrial target. Antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III in electron transport, reversed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, OS generation, ER Ca2+ depletion, and cell death by Ec, suggesting complex III dependence for these effects. Antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine prevented ER Ca2+ depletion and cell death by Ec. However, inhibition of Ca2+ influx by Ec was unaffected by either antimycin A or the antioxidants, suggesting that this target is distinct from the mitochondrial target of Ec. Atractyloside, an adenine nucleotide transport inhibitor, generated ROS and stimulated ER Ca2+ release, but it did not block Ca2+ influx, deplete the ER or induce cell death. Taken together, these results demonstrate that combined mitochondrial ROS generation and Ca2+ influx blockade by Ec is required for cell death.","['Zhang, Yicheng', 'Soboloff, Jonathan', 'Zhu, Ziping', 'Berger, Stuart A']","['Zhang Y', 'Soboloff J', 'Zhu Z', 'Berger SA']","['Arthritis and Immune Disorder Research Centre, University Health Network and Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Medical Discovery Tower, 8th Floor, Rm 8-356, 101 College St., Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '17754-44-8 (Atractyloside)', '642-15-9 (Antimycin A)', '6Z1Y2V4A7M (Econazole)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Antimycin A/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Atractyloside/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Econazole/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.106.024323 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.106.024323 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Oct;70(4):1424-34. doi: 10.1124/mol.106.024323.

Immunoglobulin VH (IgVH) mutational status and expression of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling mediators have been associated with disease progression. However, the consequences of BCR engagement on cell survival and evolution of the disease remain unclear. We show here that B-CLL cell survival is dependent on the threshold of BCR stimulation induced by immobilized antibody, in contrast to soluble anti-mu F(ab)'2 antibody, which leads to apoptosis. Measurement of metabolic activity and apoptotic response discriminated two subgroups. ""Nonresponders"" showed low metabolic activity and unmodified apoptotic response upon BCR stimulation. In contrast, ""responders"" exhibited increased metabolic activity and inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis. This survival advantage was associated to a BCR-dependent activation profile leading to induction of cyclin D2/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) expression and G1 cell cycle progression. The ability to respond to BCR ligation correlated with an unfavorable clinical course and allowed to define an additional group of patients among IgVH-mutated cases exhibiting a risk of progression. Remarkably, we show that Zap70 expression was neither mandatory nor sufficient to generate downstream survival signals and cyclin D2/cdk4 up-regulation. In conclusion, BCR engagement has a significant effect on B-CLL cell survival, activation, and G1 progression. Furthermore, our results provide new insights in the physiopathology of progressive IgVH-mutated cases.","['Deglesne, Pierre-Antoine', 'Chevallier, Nathalie', 'Letestu, Remi', 'Baran-Marszak, Fanny', 'Beitar, Taoufik', 'Salanoubat, Celia', 'Sanhes, Laurence', 'Nataf, Joelle', 'Roger, Claudine', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence']","['Deglesne PA', 'Chevallier N', 'Letestu R', 'Baran-Marszak F', 'Beitar T', 'Salanoubat C', 'Sanhes L', 'Nataf J', 'Roger C', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F']","[""Unite Propre de Recherche de l'Enseignement Superieur EA-3406, Hopital Avicenne Universite Paris 13 Bobigny, France.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (anti-IgM)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/14/7158 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0085 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 15;66(14):7158-66. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0085.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanisms by which COX-2 inhibition induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. COX-2 inhibition triggered expression of the CD95, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-R, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R1 and TRAIL-R2 death receptors. Addition of the respective specific ligands further increased apoptosis, indicating that COX-2 inhibition induced the expression of functional death receptors. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain mutant reduced COX-2 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings showed a link between COX-2 inhibition and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. COX-2 inhibition led to a rapid down-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, followed by translocation of Bax to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Consequently, overexpression of Mcl-1 led to inhibition of COX-2 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking endogenous Mcl-1 function using a small-interfering RNA approach enhanced COX-2 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. It is of clinical importance that celecoxib acted synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs in the induction of apoptosis in HCC cells. The clinical relevance of these results is further substantiated by the finding that COX-2 inhibitors did not sensitize primary human hepatocytes toward chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, COX-2 inhibition engages different apoptosis pathways in HCC cells stimulating death receptor signaling, activation of caspases, and apoptosis originating from mitochondria.","['Kern, Michael A', 'Haugg, Anke M', 'Koch, Andreas F', 'Schilling, Tobias', 'Breuhahn, Kai', 'Walczak, Henning', 'Fleischer, Binje', 'Trautwein, Christian', 'Michalski, Christoph', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Friess, Helmut', 'Stremmel, Wolfgang', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Schirmacher, Peter', 'Muller, Martina']","['Kern MA', 'Haugg AM', 'Koch AF', 'Schilling T', 'Breuhahn K', 'Walczak H', 'Fleischer B', 'Trautwein C', 'Michalski C', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Friess H', 'Stremmel W', 'Krammer PH', 'Schirmacher P', 'Muller M']","['Institute of Pathology and Department of General Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/biosynthesis', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*enzymology/physiology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/metabolism']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/14/7059 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0325 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 15;66(14):7059-66. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0325.,,,,['Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5575-6; author reply 5576.

This translocation leads to fusion of MYST3 (MOZ) and CREBBP (CBP) genes, probably resulting in a disturbed transcriptional program of a myelomonocytic precursor. Nonetheless, its gene expression profile is unknown. We have analyzed the gene expression profile of 23 AML patients, including three with molecularly confirmed MYST3-CREBBP fusion gene, using oligonucleotide U133A arrays (Affymetrix). MYST3-CREBBP cases clustered together and clearly differentiated from samples with PML-RARalpha, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFbeta-MYH11 rearrangements. The relative expression of 46 genes, selected according to their differential expression in the high-density array study, was analyzed by low-density arrays in an additional series of 40 patients, which included 7 MYST3-CREBBP AML cases. Thus, genes such as prolactin (PRL) and proto-oncogene RET were confirmed to be specifically overexpressed in MYST3-CREBBP samples whereas genes such as CCND2, STAT5A, and STAT5B were differentially underexpressed in this AML category. Interestingly, MYST3-CREBBP AML exhibited a characteristic pattern of HOX expression, with up-regulation of HOXA9, HOXA10, and cofactor MEIS1 and marked down-regulation of other homeobox genes. This profile, with overexpression of FLT3, HOXA9, MEIS1, AKR7A2, CHD3, and APBA2, partially resembles that of AML with MLL rearrangement. In summary, this study shows the distinctive gene expression profile of MYST3-CREBBP AML, with overexpression of RET and PRL and a specific pattern of HOX gene expression.","['Camos, Mireia', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Carrio, Ana', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias']","['Camos M', 'Esteve J', 'Jares P', 'Colomer D', 'Rozman M', 'Villamor N', 'Costa D', 'Carrio A', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E']","['Hematopathology Unit, Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/14/6947 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4601 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 15;66(14):6947-54. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this article was to investigate the possibility of combating the resistance to apoptosis caused by Bcr-Abl by inducing an alternative cell death process. As a model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we employed Bcr-Abl-transfected mouse progenitor 32D cells with low and high Bcr-Abl expression levels corresponding to drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, respectively. The drug curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a known potent inducer of cell death in many cancer cells, was investigated for efficacy with Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Curcumin strongly inhibited cell proliferation and affected cell viability by inducing apoptotic symptoms in all tested cells; however, apoptosis was a relatively late event. G(2)-M cell cycle arrest, together with increased mitotic index and cellular and nuclear morphology resembling those described for mitotic catastrophe, was observed and preceded caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Mitosis-arrested cells displayed abnormal chromatin organization, multipolar chromosome segregation, aberrant cytokinesis, and multinucleated cells-morphologic changes typical of mitotic catastrophe. We found that the mitotic cell death symptoms correlated with attenuated expression of survivin, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, and mislocalization of Aurora B, the partner of survivin in the chromosomal passenger complex. Inhibition of survivin expression with small interfering RNA exhibited similar mitotic disturbances, thus implicating survivin as a major, albeit not the only, target for curcumin action. This study shows that curcumin can overcome the broad resistance to cell death caused by expression of Bcr-Abl and suggests that curcumin may be a promising agent for new combination regimens for drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Wolanin, Kamila', 'Magalska, Adriana', 'Mosieniak, Grazyna', 'Klinger, Rut', 'McKenna, Sharon', 'Vejda, Susanne', 'Sikora, Ewa', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna']","['Wolanin K', 'Magalska A', 'Mosieniak G', 'Klinger R', 'McKenna S', 'Vejda S', 'Sikora E', 'Piwocka K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Bases of Aging, Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Survivin']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/08/30 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/7/457 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0172 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2006 Jul;4(7):457-69. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metaphase chromosomes were banded using the conventional trypsin-Giemsa banding technique. Analysis of ploidy revealed 16 (20.5%) patients with normal diploidy, 28 (35.9%) with pseudodiploidy, 6 (7.7%) with hyperdiploidy (47-50), 19 (24.4%) with hyperdiploidy (> 50), and 9 (9.4%) hypodiploidy. Near-haploidy was not observed. Of the patients with abnormal karyotypes, recurrent structural abnormalities were determined in 31 (50%) cases, with the most frequent t(9;22).

Osteoblasts synthesise proteins that stimulate and inhibit HSC proliferation. In addition to angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1), osteoblasts synthesise and express the highly acidic glycoprotein, osteopontin (Opn), which, like Ang-1, acts as a potent constraining factor on HSC proliferation. Overexpression of Opn is a feature of haemopoietic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid leukaemia, although its exact role in the aetiology and progression of these diseases remains unclear.

This has led to attempts to develop risk-directed strategies in which the most intensive treatment is reserved for those at highest risk of relapse. Unfortunately, current approaches, which rely on cytogenetic sub-grouping and morphological assessment of response to therapy, are inaccurate. New prognostic factors are needed. This annotation proposes that the introduction of protocols based on the measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) holds the key to progression from an era of 'cure at all costs' to a more individualised approach.

The term ""targeted cancer therapy"" refers to a new generation of drugs designed to interfere with a specific molecular target that is believed to play a critical role in tumor growth or progression, is not expressed significantly in normal cells, and is correlated with clinical outcome. There has been a rapid increase in the identification of targets that have potential therapeutic application. The clinical success of the small-molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors has accelerated the development of a new era of molecular targeted cancer therapy. The number of agents under preclinical and clinical investigation has grown accordingly. This emphasis on molecular biology and genetics has also resulted in significant changes in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Several promising drugs targeting tyrosine kinases (EGFR and Her-2/Neu), mTOR, Raf kinase, proteasome, and histone deacetylases, as well as drugs affecting apoptosis and mitosis, are under development for clinical application. However, some clinical trials of p53 gene therapies and farnesyl transferase inhibitors have had limited success.

This strategy is being used in order to optimize differentiation protocols that would result in functional cells for experimental cell replacement therapies. However, this study presents the possibility for residual undifferentiated cells to survive after standard in vitro procedures. Mouse ES cells were stably transfected with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), under the control of the Oct4 promoter, a transcription factor that is expressed in undifferentiated ES cells but down-regulated on differentiation. Residual fluorescent cells were isolated from EBs that were cultured in standard conditions in absence of LIF. These residual cells displayed recurrent gain of chromosomes 8 and 9. Residual fluorescent cells, further expanded in absence of LIF and cultured as EBs, still displayed a significant Oct4 expression in comparison with parental transfected ES cells. Consequently, these residual cells have an intrinsic resistance to differentiate. The behavior of these cells, observed in vitro, can be overcome in vivo, as they were able to induce teratomas in subcutaneously injected nude mice. Residual undifferentiated cells displayed slight levels of VASA and DAZL expression. These results demonstrate that mouse ES cells cultured in vitro, in standard conditions, can spontaneously acquire recurrent karyotypical changes that may promote an undifferentiated stage, being selected in standard culture conditions in vitro.","['Ensenat-Waser, Roberto', 'Santana, Alfredo', 'Vicente-Salar, Nestor', 'Cigudosa, Juan C', 'Roche, Enrique', 'Soria, Bernat', 'Reig, Juan A']","['Ensenat-Waser R', 'Santana A', 'Vicente-Salar N', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Roche E', 'Soria B', 'Reig JA']","['Instituto de Bioingenieria, Unidad de Bioquimica y Terapia Celular, Universidad Miguel Hernandez, Elche, Alicante, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

METHODS: The manifestation, detection, treatment options and complications of unilateral acute retinal necrosis are illustrated by six case reports. RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompetent, whereas the sixth one suffered from chronic leukemia. In two patients the disease developed in association with herpes zoster, whereas the remaining four showed no signs of herpes disease. Systemic therapy with acyclovir, corticosteroids, salicylates and photocoagulation produced favorable response in five patients. Therapy had to be discontinued in leukemia patient for complications, which resulted in the disease recurrence with retinal detachment and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Other patients remained stable with preserved visual function and only minor complications. DISCUSSION: In all six patients, the accurate diagnosis was reached relatively late. Obviously, anterior uveitis alone attracted ophthalmologists' attention, and their diagnostic and therapeutic efforts had mostly been focused on anterior uveitis impairment in the visual acuity developed. Appropriate therapy with virostatics, which is necessary in the treatment of this disease, was introduced relatively late, however, all patients responded favorably to this therapy, which also held for the immunocompromised patients administered a half usual dose of acyclovir. Our experience confirmed that virostatic therapy for acute retinal necrosis should be administered for at least 6 weeks. Retinal photocoagulation for prevention of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment appers to be beneficial, as this type of retinal detachment did not develop in these patients. The patient who did not undergo laser photocoagulation of retina did not develop rhegmatogenous retinal detachment but did develop proliferative vitreoretinopathy. CONCLUSION: Acute retinal necrosis is a relatively common disease affecting visual function, which occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects. The disease with its typical clinical picture and many complications should be taken in consideration on the differential diagnosis of uveitis. Therapy for acute retinal necrosis is complex, long-term and associated with frequent systemic complications that may threaten the patient's general health status.","['Vukojevic, Nenad', 'Popovic Suic, Smiljka', 'Sikic, Jakov', 'Katusic, Damir', 'Curkovic, Tihomir', 'Saric, Borna', 'Jukic, Tomislav']","['Vukojevic N', 'Popovic Suic S', 'Sikic J', 'Katusic D', 'Curkovic T', 'Saric B', 'Jukic T']","['Klinika za ocne bolesti, Klinicki bolnicki centar Zagreb, Zagreb, Hrvatska. nenad.vukojevic@zq.htnet.hr']",,['hrv'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Retinal Necrosis Syndrome, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2006;60(2):145-8.,,,,,,,,,,,Akutna retinalna nekroza.,,,

Bone mineral density (g/cm2) of lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Norland bone densitometer) in 18 children with ALL and a median of 34 months' post-diagnosis with no history of relapse, secondary malignancy, or transplantation. In addition, patients' BMDs were correlated with particular attention to age, sex and time (years) from completion of chemotherapy. The results were compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls of the same population and expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Mean age of children was 9.8 +/- 3.7 years. Of 18 children (10 boys and 8 girls), 13 were grouped as standard and 5 as high-risk, respectively. Based on z-score values, 9 were classified as normal (z-score <1 SD), 7 as osteopenic (z-score 1-2.5 SD) and 2 as osteoporotic (z-score >2.5 SD). Children with ALL had reduced lumbar BMDs (z score -0.99) in comparison to healthy controls (z score -0.14) (p=0.011), which is indicative of relative osteopenia. Moreover, the reduced BMD was associated with patient age (z score -0.14 and -1.52 for ages <10 and >10 years, respectively, p=0.016). Reduced BMD was not correlated with time from completion of chemotherapy (p=0.33), risk group (p=0.9) and sex (p=0.3). We conclude that children's BMDs are reduced after completion of chemotherapy for ALL. The causes are multifactorial and mainly related to antineoplastic treatments, such as corticosteroids and methotrexate, physical inactivity and cranial irradiation. We suggest that further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effect on BMD in these children and to prevent pathological fractures later in life.","['Athanassiadou, Fani', 'Tragiannidis, Athanassios', 'Rousso, Israel', 'Katsos, Georgios', 'Sidi, Vassiliki', 'Papageorgiou, Theodotis', 'Papastergiou, Christos', 'Tsituridis, Ioannis', 'Koliouskas, Dimitrios']","['Athanassiadou F', 'Tragiannidis A', 'Rousso I', 'Katsos G', 'Sidi V', 'Papageorgiou T', 'Papastergiou C', 'Tsituridis I', 'Koliouskas D']","['Hematology-Oncology Unit, 2nd Pediatric Department, AHEPA Hospital, Greece.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Osteoporosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Survivors']",2006/07/20 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/07/20 09:00'],"['2006/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2006 Apr-Jun;48(2):101-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ginseng has been used extensively in traditional medicine; however, few studies were focused on their anti-allergic effect. Therefore, the effect and mechanism of ginsenoside Rb1 on the SP enhancement of allergic mediators were explored. In this study, SP and dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) were used to activate rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. The cultured supernatants were assayed for histamine, leukotriene C(4)(LTC(4)) and interleulin-4 (IL-4) production. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting analysis. We found that IgE/DNP-BSA, SP, ginsenoside Rb1, or MAPK specific inhibitors had no effect on cell viability and cytotoxicity. SP (30 microM) alone, did not induce histamine and LTC(4) release, but it enhanced allergen-induced histamine and LTC(4) release. In addition, SP significantly induced and enhanced allergen-activated IL-4. Ginsenoside Rb1 dose-dependently inhibited these effects.

Although MAPK specific inhibitors suppressed LTC(4) and IL-4, only U0126 inhibited the SP enhanced histamine release.

A report of two cases.,320-7,"We present two cases of small B-cell lymphomas of particular diagnostic interest because the histological patterns were at variance with their immunophenotype. One of these lymphomas, involving the gallbladder and duodenum, showed a marginal zone lymphoma-like (MALT type) pattern of cellular infiltration with CD5 negativity but (unexpectedly) Cyclin D1 positivity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of this case was performed because of the aberrant expression of Cyclin D1, and was clearly positive for the Cyclin D1 gene translocation. The second case, occurring in a lymph node, showed the typical growth pattern of a follicular lymphoma but it had an atypical immunophenotype, namely, expression of Cyclin D1, CD10, and Bcl2 and focally Bcl6, accompanied by a lack of CD5 and CD23. The Cyclin D1 gene translocation was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whereas c-myc and Bcl2 genes translocation were absent. Numerical chromosomal changes, which were visualized for chromosomes 8, 11, and 18 could be correlated to the aberrant immunoprofile. In this context, we discuss the diagnostic value of Cyclin D1, CD5, CD23, CD10, Bcl6 markers revealed by immunohistochemistry, as well as the significance of detection by FISH of chromosomal translocations such as t(11;14) and t(14;18). The question still remains as to whether such cases should be designated as specific lymphoma entities or reported as unclassifiable and the chromosome aberration reported.","['Kostopoulos, Ioannis', 'Cocco, Mario', 'Ginanneschi, Chiara', ""D'Amuri, Alessandro"", 'Lazzi, Stefano', 'Fabbri, Alberto', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'De Santi, Maria Margherita', 'Leoncini, Lorenzo']","['Kostopoulos I', 'Cocco M', 'Ginanneschi C', ""D'Amuri A"", 'Lazzi S', 'Fabbri A', 'Forconi F', 'De Santi MM', 'Leoncini L']","['Department of Pathology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/07/19 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00428-006-0242-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2006 Sep;449(3):320-7. doi: 10.1007/s00428-006-0242-1.

Starting from an expression-profiling screen, we identified c-myc as a direct target of Notch1 in Notch-dependent T-ALL cell lines, in which Notch accounts for the majority of c-myc expression. In functional assays, inhibitors of c-myc interfere with the progrowth effects of activated Notch1, and enforced expression of c-myc rescues multiple Notch1-dependent T-ALL cell lines from Notch withdrawal. The existence of a Notch1-c-myc signaling axis was bolstered further by experiments using c-myc-dependent murine T-ALL cells, which are rescued from withdrawal of c-myc by retroviral transduction of activated Notch1. This Notch1-mediated rescue is associated with the up-regulation of endogenous murine c-myc and its downstream transcriptional targets, and the acquisition of sensitivity to Notch pathway inhibitors. Additionally, we show that primary murine thymocytes at the DN3 stage of development depend on ligand-induced Notch signaling to maintain c-myc expression. Together, these data implicate c-myc as a developmentally regulated direct downstream target of Notch1 that contributes to the growth of T-ALL cells.","['Weng, Andrew P', 'Millholland, John M', 'Yashiro-Ohtani, Yumi', 'Arcangeli, Marie Laure', 'Lau, Arthur', 'Wai, Carol', 'Del Bianco, Cristina', 'Rodriguez, Carlos G', 'Sai, Hong', 'Tobias, John', 'Li, Yueming', 'Wolfe, Michael S', 'Shachaf, Cathy', 'Felsher, Dean', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Weng AP', 'Millholland JM', 'Yashiro-Ohtani Y', 'Arcangeli ML', 'Lau A', 'Wai C', 'Del Bianco C', 'Rodriguez CG', 'Sai H', 'Tobias J', 'Li Y', 'Wolfe MS', 'Shachaf C', 'Felsher D', 'Blacklow SC', 'Pear WS', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R56 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 09140-31-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA092433-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119130-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-01A19001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-06A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism']",2006/07/19 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['gad.1450406 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1450406 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2006 Aug 1;20(15):2096-109. doi: 10.1101/gad.1450406.

To understand the in vivo role of Prep1, we have analyzed an embryonic lethal hypomorphic mutant mouse (Prep1(i/i)). Prep1(i/i) embryos die at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) to birth with an overall organ hypoplasia, severe anemia, impaired angiogenesis, and eye anomalies, particularly in the lens and retina. The anemia correlates with delayed differentiation of erythroid progenitors and may be, at least in part, responsible for intrauterine death. At E14.5, Prep1 is present in fetal liver (FL) cMyb-positive cells, whose deficiency causes a marked hematopoietic phenotype. Prep1 is also localized to FL endothelial progenitors, consistent with the observed angiogenic phenotype. Likewise, at the same gestational day, Prep1 is present in the eye cells that bear Pax6, implicated in eye development. The levels of cMyb and Pax6 in FL and in the retina, respectively, are significantly decreased in Prep1(i/i) embryos, consistent with the hematopoietic and eye phenotypes. Concomitantly, Prep1 deficiency results in the overall decrease of protein levels of its related family member Meis1 and its partners Pbx1 and Pbx2.

Therefore, a substitution and deletion analysis of the R region of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based vectors was performed and the effect of the modifications on packaging and transfer by SIV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles was analysed. Deletion of the first 7 nt of R reduced vector titres by 10- to 20-fold, whilst deletion of the entire R region led to vector titres that were 1500-fold lower. Replacement of the R region of SIV-based vectors by HIV-1 or Moloney murine sarcoma virus R regions partially restored vector titres. A non-retroviral cellular sequence was also functional, although to a lesser extent. In the absence of tat, modification of the R region had only minor effects on cytoplasmic RNA stability, steady-state levels of vector RNA and packaging, consistent with the known primary function of R during reverse transcription. Although the SIV R region of SIV-based vectors could be replaced functionally by heterologous sequences, the same modifications of R led to a severe replication defect in the context of a replication-competent SIV. As SIV-based vectors containing the HIV-1 R region were transferred less efficiently by HIV-1 particles than wild-type SIV vectors, a match between R and cis-acting elements of the vector construct seems to be more important than a match between R and the Gag or Pol proteins of the vector particle.","['Brandt, Sabine', 'Grunwald, Thomas', 'Lucke, Susann', 'Stang, Alexander', 'Uberla, Klaus']","['Brandt S', 'Grunwald T', 'Lucke S', 'Stang A', 'Uberla K']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Virus Assembly/genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2006/07/19 09:00,2006/09/16 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.81883-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2006 Aug;87(Pt 8):2297-2307. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81883-0.,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81883-0 [doi],,,,

This activity correlates with the functions of IE1 in transcriptional regulation and in the stimulation of lytic infection. Here, the effects of IE1 in induction of desumoylation of PML were characterized. IE1 did not interfere with the formation of sumoylated forms of PML in vitro. In in vitro assays using the sumoylated proteins, a SUMO-specific protease SENP1 desumoylated both PML and IE1. However, the IE1 proteins generated from bacteria or insect cells were unable to desumoylate PML in the same conditions. Although both IE1 and SUMO proteases such as SENP1, Axam and SuPr-1 efficiently desumoylated PML in co-transfection assays, they exerted different effects on the localization of PML. In cells transfected with either SENP1 or SuPr-1, the number of PML foci was reduced significantly and these remnant PML foci were devoid of SUMO-1 signals. However, in cells co-transfected with both SUMO proteases and IE1, these SUMO-independent PML foci were also completely disrupted. Furthermore, IE1, but not SENP1, was shown to disrupt the PML foci generated via transfection of a sumoylation-deficient mutant of PML. These data suggest that IE1 exhibits neither an inhibitory effect on sumoylation of PML nor intrinsic SUMO protease activity against PML in vitro. The finding that IE1 is capable of disrupting SUMO-independent PML aggregates suggests that inhibition of PML oligomerization by IE1 may play an important role in inducing PML desumoylation in vivo.","['Kang, Heejung', 'Kim, Eui Tae', 'Lee, Hye-Ra', 'Park, Jung-Jin', 'Go, Yoon Young', 'Choi, Cheol Yong', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Kang H', 'Kim ET', 'Lee HR', 'Park JJ', 'Go YY', 'Choi CY', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Cheoncheondong, Jangangu, Suwon, Gyeonggido 440-746, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Cheoncheondong, Jangangu, Suwon, Gyeonggido 440-746, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Cheoncheondong, Jangangu, Suwon, Gyeonggido 440-746, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Cheoncheondong, Jangangu, Suwon, Gyeonggido 440-746, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Cheoncheondong, Jangangu, Suwon, Gyeonggido 440-746, Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (SENP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cytomegalovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/07/19 09:00,2006/09/16 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.81787-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2006 Aug;87(Pt 8):2181-2190. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81787-0.,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81787-0 [doi],,,,

METHODS: r-AML that arose in (CBA/HxC57BL/6)F1xCBA/H and F1xC57BL/6 mice were screened for transcription factor PU1 (also known as SPI-1) gene mutations and methylation of the paired box gene 5 (Pax5) gene promoter. We have increased the statistical significance of a genetic linkage analysis of affected F1xCBA/H mice to test for linkage to loci implicated directly or indirectly with r-AML-susceptibility. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference ( p < 10-4) in the frequency of PU1 gene mutations in F1xCBA/H and F1xC57BL/6 r-AML, implicating a second linked but genotype-dependent myeloid leukaemia suppressor gene on chromosome 2. A suggestive CBA/H r-AML-resistance locus maps within 10 cM of the minimally deleted region on chromosome 4. The Pax5 gene promoter is subject to ongoing subclonal promoter methylation in the r-AML, evidence that Pax5 gene silencing confers a selective advantage during clonal expansion in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Allelic loss in mouse r-AML and subsequent tumour suppressor gene mutation (PU1) or silencing (Pax5) is strongly influenced by genetic background and/or epigenetic factors, and driven by in vivo clonal selection.","['Jawad, Mays', 'Cole, Clare', 'Zanker, Abigail', 'Lo, Priscilla', 'Fitch, Simon', 'Plumb, Mark']","['Jawad M', 'Cole C', 'Zanker A', 'Lo P', 'Fitch S', 'Plumb M']","['Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone and Bones/pathology/radiation effects', 'Chromosomes', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Spleen/pathology/radiation effects']",2006/07/19 09:00,2006/09/06 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['V31W2062756P416T [pii]', '10.1080/09553000600784161 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2006 Jun;82(6):383-91. doi: 10.1080/09553000600784161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is present on immune cells, such as macrophages, and mediates the direct immunomodulatory effects of opioids. Through its surface glycoprotein, gp120, HIV-1 binds to surface receptors on target cells, including macrophages, to exert its pathological effects. Binding of gp120 to macrophages stimulates the cells to release various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, which has been shown to regulate transcription of the MOR gene. In this study, we examined the effects of HIV-1 gp120 on MOR expression in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells by TPA. Using real time RT-PCR, we found that exposure to gp120 up-regulated MOR expression in TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells at the transcriptional level. The functionality of the gp120-induced MOR in these cells was confirmed based on morphine's inhibition of forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP, which was naloxone reversible. Exposure to gp120 also stimulated the release of TNF-alpha from TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells. Treatment with TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody, as well as blockage of TNF-alpha's actions by anti-TNF-alpha receptor type II (TNFR-II) antibody, inhibited gp120-induced up-regulation of MOR mRNA. Our data suggest that one of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 gp120 up-regulates the MOR in TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells is through autocrine/paracrine actions of TNF-alpha via the TNFR-II receptor.","['Beltran, Jose A', 'Pallur, Anitha', 'Chang, Sulie L']","['Beltran JA', 'Pallur A', 'Chang SL']","['Department of Biology, Seton Hall University, McNulty Hall, Room 215, South Orange, NJ 07079, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K02 DA 016149/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA 007058/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid, mu)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Opioid, mu/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation/genetics']",2006/07/19 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(06)00150-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2006.04.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2006 Sep;6(9):1459-67. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2006.04.018.

Upon stimulation, the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47(phox) and p67(phox) and the small GTPase Rac move to phagosomal and plasma membranes where they become associated with the membrane components of NADPH oxidase, gp91(phox) and p22(phox) and express enzyme activity. We previously showed that taurine chloramine (Tau-Cl) inhibits O(2)(-) production in mouse peritoneal neutrophils (Kim, 1996). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying Tau-Cl-derived inhibition on O(2)(-) production using a human myeloid leukemia cell line, PLB-985 cell, which has been differentiated into neutrophil-like cell. Tau-Cl inhibited the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-elicited O(2)(-) production as previously observed in murine peritoneal neutrophils. Translocation of p47(phox), p67(phox) and Rac was increased in response to PMA, and Tau-Cl inhibited the PMA-stimulated translocation of p47(phox) and p67(phox) to plasma membrane without affecting the translocation of Rac. In addition, Tau-Cl inhibited the PMA-derived phosphorylation of p47(phox), a requirement for the translocation of cytosolic NADPH oxidase component to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Tau-Cl inhibits PMA-elicited O(2)(-) production in PLB-985 granulocytes by inhibiting phosphorylation of p47(phox) and translocation of p47(phox) and p67(phox), eventually blocking the assembly of NADPH oxidase complex.","['Choi, Hyung Sim', 'Cha, Young-Nam', 'Kim, Chaekyun']","['Choi HS', 'Cha YN', 'Kim C']","['Laboratory of Leukocyte Signaling Research and Center for Advanced Medical Education by BK21 Project, Inha University College of Medicine, Incheon 400-712, South Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', '51036-13-6 (N-chlorotaurine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'NADPH Oxidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Superoxides/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Taurine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2006/07/19 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(06)00130-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2006.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2006 Sep;6(9):1431-40. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2006.04.014.

We previously reported that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a major oncogenic signalling protein, is the target of p210-BCR-ABL in a murine embryonic stem (ES) cell model and in primary CD34+ CML cells. This activation was associated with inhibition of differentiation in ES cells. The present study found that BCR-ABL greatly phosphorylated STAT3 Ser727 residue and, to a lesser extent, Tyr705 residue in BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines (UT7-p210, MO7E-p210, and K562) and in primary CD34+ CML cells. Using BCR-ABL mutants, it was shown that BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity and its Tyr177 residue were necessary for STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. Constitutive STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation was associated with constitutive phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, and was inhibited by the JAK inhibitor AG490, suggesting the involvement of JAK proteins in this process. Specific MEK [mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase] inhibitors PD98056 and UO126, as well as the use of a dominant-negative form of MEK1 abrogated STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation, suggesting involvement of MAP-Kinase/Erk pathway. Inhibition of BCR-ABL with imatinib mesylate led to a dose-dependent downregulation of total STAT3 protein and mRNA, suggesting that BCR-ABL is involved in the transcriptional regulation of STAT3. Targeting JAK, MEK and STAT3 pathways could therefore be of therapeutic value, especially in advanced stage CML.","['Coppo, Paul', 'Flamant, Stephane', 'De Mas, Veronique', 'Jarrier, Peggy', 'Guillier, Martine', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Lacout, Catherine', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Coppo P', 'Flamant S', 'De Mas V', 'Jarrier P', 'Guillier M', 'Bonnet ML', 'Lacout C', 'Guilhot F', 'Vainchenker W', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM U362 Unite Hematopoiese et Cellules Souches, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/07/19 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6161 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06161.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jul;134(2):171-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06161.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, DBC1 methylation was associated with decreased DBC1 expression, while treatment of ALL cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in demethylation of the promoter and upregulation of DBC1 expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation identified the deletion of one allele of DBC1 in some ALL cell lines, which indicated that the lack of DBC1 expression was due to deletion of one allele and methylation of the other.

After 6 d of hanging drop culture, the resulting EBs are plated onto plastic dishes for the outgrowth culture. At d 21 after outgrowth culture, cell populations of EBs can give rise to three-dimensional gut-like structures that exhibit spontaneous contraction and highly coordinated peristalsis. The gut-like structures have large lumens surrounded by three layers: epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis. Ganglia are scattered along the periphery, and interstitial cells of Cajal are distributed among the smooth muscle cells. The fundamental process of formation of the in vitro organized gut-like structures is similar to embryonic gastrointestinal development in vivo.

METHODS: Three kinds of leukemia cells, NB4, K562, and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, were cultured in the media with constant concentration and varying concentrations of As2O3 respectively for 24 hours. Seventy-five patients were enrolled in two groups randomly. In trial group, 37 patients received continuously slow intravenous As2O3 infusion regimen for 24 hours with an infusion rate of 8 drips per minute and total infusion duration of about 18-21 hours daily. In control group, 38 patients received routine regimen with an infusion rate of 45-55 drips per minute and total infusion duration of about 2-3 hours daily for 24 hours. The daily As2O3 dosage was 0. 16 mg/kg. The intracellular arsenic concentration was measured by atomic fluorescence assay. The apoptosis rate of cells, CD33- CD11b+ cells, and CD33+ CD11b- cells were monitored by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The apoptosis rates of NB4, K562, and APL leukemia cells in the media with constant As2O3 concentration were 56.6% +/- 2.4%, 27.6% +/- 3.1%, and 52.2% +/- 2.8%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those with changing As2O3 concentration (23.2% +/- 2.1%, 11.0% +/- 2.5%, and 21.0% +/- 2.5%, respectively, P < 0.01). The apoptosis rates of APL, M2 type acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in the trial group (28.5% +/- 1.9%, 9.5% +/- 0.6%, and 12.5% +/- 1.8%) were also significantly higher than those in control group (8.5% +/- 2.2%, 2. 9% +/- 0.8%, and 4.5% +/- 1.2%; P < 0.05). The ratios of CD33 CD11b- and CD33- CD11b+ cells in control group were significantly higher than those in trial group. CONCLUSION: The continuously slow intravenous As2O3 infusion regimen can obtain high efficiency of apoptosis and low differentiation proportion, relieve leukocytosis, and gain maximal therapeutic benefit.","['Zhou, Jin', 'Meng, Ran', 'Sui, Xin-Hua', 'Meng, Lu', 'Yang, Bao-Feng']","['Zhou J', 'Meng R', 'Sui XH', 'Meng L', 'Yang BF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001. jinzhouh85@163.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytosis/blood/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage']",2006/07/19 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2006/07/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 2006 Jun;21(2):111-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the discovery of these entry inhibitors, robust surrogate anti-HIV assays are highly desired. The authors report a novel anti-HIV assay system using Moloney murine leukemia viruses (MMLVs) pseudotyped with cytoplasmic tail-truncated HIV envelope protein gp140. These pseudotyped MMLV-HIVgp140 viral particles carry luciferase transcripts; therefore, robust luciferase signal can be detected in cells infected by these pseudotypes. Polycationic agent polybrene and spinoculation markedly enhanced the infection efficiency of these pseudotypes. It was demonstrated that the tropism of these pseudotypes is dependent on the pseudotyped HIV envelope proteins. MMLV viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an R5 HIV virus specifically infect CCR5-expressing cells, and viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an X4 HIV virus specifically infect CXCR4-expressing cells. Furthermore, CCR5 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(R5) infections, and CXCR4 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(X4) infections. A variety of known HIV entry inhibitors were tested in both R5- and X4-dependent pseudotype antiviral assays, and the IC50 values generated were consistent with published results. The pseudotype antiviral assay was also used in the characterization of hundreds of novel CCR5 antagonists. The IC50 values determined in this assay were compared with those determined in HIV antiviral and cell-cell fusion (CCF) assays, and good correlation was found between pseudotype antiviral assay and HIV antiviral assay (R2 = 0.9) or CCF assay (R2 = 0.8).","['Chan, Eva', 'Heilek-Snyder, Gabrielle', 'Cammack, Nick', 'Sankuratri, Surya', 'Ji, Changhua']","['Chan E', 'Heilek-Snyder G', 'Cammack N', 'Sankuratri S', 'Ji C']","['Viral Diseases, Roche Palo Alto, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Receptors, HIV)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, HIV/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/07/18 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1087057106288881 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057106288881 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2006 Sep;11(6):652-63. doi: 10.1177/1087057106288881.

Shevade and Keerthi propose a gene selection algorithm based on sparse logistic regression (SLogReg) incorporating a Laplace prior to promote sparsity in the model parameters, and provide a simple but efficient training procedure. The degree of sparsity obtained is determined by the value of a regularization parameter, which must be carefully tuned in order to optimize performance. This normally involves a model selection stage, based on a computationally intensive search for the minimizer of the cross-validation error. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple Bayesian approach can be taken to eliminate this regularization parameter entirely, by integrating it out analytically using an uninformative Jeffrey's prior. The improved algorithm (BLogReg) is then typically two or three orders of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, as there is no longer a need for a model selection step. The BLogReg algorithm is also free from selection bias in performance estimation, a common pitfall in the application of machine learning algorithms in cancer classification. RESULTS: The SLogReg, BLogReg and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) gene selection algorithms are evaluated over the well-studied colon cancer and leukaemia benchmark datasets. The leave-one-out estimates of the probability of test error and cross-entropy of the BLogReg and SLogReg algorithms are very similar, however the BlogReg algorithm is found to be considerably faster than the original SLogReg algorithm. Using nested cross-validation to avoid selection bias, performance estimation for SLogReg on the leukaemia dataset takes almost 48 h, whereas the corresponding result for BLogReg is obtained in only 1 min 24 s, making BLogReg by far the more practical algorithm. BLogReg also demonstrates better estimates of conditional probability than the RVM, which are of great importance in medical applications, with similar computational expense.

The patient's renal function improved dramatically after the initiation of chemotherapy, clearly linking the development of ARF to the malignant process. In the second case, infiltration of the kidneys by plasma cell leukemia resulted in dialysis dependence. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of ARF attributable to documented renal infiltration by plasma cell leukemia.

Since MX is a well-documented substrate for the efflux transporter breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP/ABCG2), we assessed the contribution of drug efflux to MX resistance in CPT-K5 cells. Our results demonstrate that CPT-K5 cells had markedly higher expression levels of BCRP, negligible expression of MRP2 and P-gp, and lower intracellular retention of MX as compared to RPMI 8402 cells. Surprisingly, MX resistance in CPT-K5 cells was not reversed by the BCRP chemical inhibitor, novobiocin (NOV), or gene-specific siRNA, although intracellular MX concentrations were significantly increased when BCRP was functionally knocked down. These results suggest that up-regulation of BCRP plays a minimal role in conferring MX resistance to CPT-K5 cells, highlighting the existence of multiple, redundant mechanisms of drug resistance. The current results support the concept of ""multifactorial multidrug resistance"", a recently-described phenomenon that ascribes multidrug resistance to many possible cellular mechanisms, not only by efflux drug transporters.","['Su, Yaming', 'Lee, Sung-Hack', 'Sinko, Patrick J']","['Su Y', 'Lee SH', 'Sinko PJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 AI/DK-51214/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI42007/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2006/07/18 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(06)00165-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2006.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2006 Oct 1;29(2):102-10. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2006.06.001.

In this study, we show that constitutively active protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase, is essential for T leukemia cell survival. Jurkat and CCRF-CEM T leukemia cells treated with the PP2A-selective inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) showed a dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis, as indicated by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)), cleavage-induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and DNA fragmentation. In addition, caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibition with z-IETD-fmk or z-LEHD-fmk, respectively, largely prevented OA-induced apoptosis. Although OA treatment did not affect constitutive Bcl-2 expression, overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented both OA-induced DNA fragmentation and dissipation of delta psi(m). Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-3, -8, or -9 partially protected against OA-induced loss of delta psi(m). In addition, caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibition largely prevented procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 cleavage, respectively, while caspase-8 inhibition partially interfered with procaspase-9 cleavage in OA-treated T leukemia cells. Thus, PP2A inhibition triggered the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which was enhanced by a mitochondrial feedback amplification loop. PP2A has also been implicated in the regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a physical association between the catalytic subunit of PP2A and p38 MAPK in T leukemia cells. Moreover, OA treatment caused p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating that PP2A prevented p38 MAPK activation. Although p38 MAPK activation usually promotes apoptosis, pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK exacerbated OA-induced DNA fragmentation and loss of delta psi(m) in T leukemia cells, suggesting that, in this instance, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway promoted cell survival. Collectively, these findings indicate that PP2A and p38 MAPK have coordinate effects on signaling pathways that regulate the survival of T leukemia cells.","['Boudreau, Robert T M', 'Conrad, David M', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Boudreau RT', 'Conrad DM', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 5850 University Ave., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada B3H 1X5.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology']",2006/07/18 09:00,2007/04/11 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(06)00144-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.05.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2007 Jan;19(1):139-51. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.05.030.

One of the main features of this theory also termed as theory of evolving complexity is the centrality of the notion of 'recursive' or 'feedback' causality - 'the idea that every biological effect in living systems, in some way, feeds back to its own cause'. Our hypothesis is that ""recursive"" or ""feedback"" causality provides a model for explaining the consequences of interacting genetic and epigenetic mechanisms which are known to play a key role in development of cancer. Epigenetics includes any process that alters gene activity without changes of the DNA sequence. The most important epigenetic mechanisms are DNA-methylation and chromatin remodeling. Hypomethylation of so-called oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes appear to be critical determinants of cancer. Folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrients influence the function of enzymes that participate in various methylation processes by affecting the supply of methyl groups into a variety of molecules which may be directly or indirectly associated with cancerogenesis. We present an example from our own studies by showing that vitamin D3 has the potential to de-methylate the osteocalcin-promoter in MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Consequently, a stimulation of osteocalcin synthesis can be observed. The above mentioned enzymes also play a role in development and differentiation of cells and organisms and thus illustrate the close association between evolutionary and developmental mechanisms. This enabled new ways to understand the interaction between the genome and environment and may improve biomedical concepts including environmental health aspects where epigenetic and genetic modifications are closely associated. Recent observations showed that methylated nucleotides in the gene promoter may serve as a target for solar UV-induced mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. This illustrates the close interaction of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in cancerogenesis resulting from changes in transcriptional regulation and its contribution to a phenotype at the micro- or macroevolutionary level. Above-mentioned interactions of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in oncogenesis defy explanation by plain linear causality, things like the continuing adaptability of complex systems. They can be explained by the concept of recursive causality and has introduced molecular biology into the realm of cognition science and systems theory: based on the notion of so-called feedback- or recursive causality a model for epigenetic mechanisms with relevance for oncology and biomedicine is provided.","['Haslberger, A', 'Varga, F', 'Karlic, H']","['Haslberger A', 'Varga F', 'Karlic H']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, Heinrich Collinstrasse 30, and Vienna Ecology Center, University of Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', '*Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/*genetics/pathology']",2006/07/18 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2006/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(06)00407-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.047 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2006;67(6):1448-54. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.047.

In the present study, the treatment of different cell lines with apigenin resulted in selective antiproliferative and apoptotic effect in monocytic and lymphocytic leukemias. Apigenin-induced-apoptosis was mediated by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Apigenin was found intracellularly and localized to the mitochondria. Treatment of monocytic cells with apigenin was accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of the MAPKs, p38 and ERK. However, the inhibition of ROS, p38 or ERK failed to block apoptosis, suggesting that these cellular responses induced by apigenin are not essential for the induction of apoptosis. In addition, apigenin induced the activation of PKCdelta. Pharmacological inhibition of PKCdelta, the expression of dominant-negative PKCdelta and silencing of PKCdelta in leukemia cells showed that apigenin-induced-apoptosis requires PKCdelta activity.

Here, we describe an unexpected tumor-promoting role for STAT1 in leukemia. STAT1(-/-) mice are partially protected from leukemia development, and STAT1(-/-) tumor cells induce leukemia in RAG2(-/-) and immunocompetent mice with increased latency. The low MHC class I protein levels of STAT1(-/-) tumor cells enable efficient NK cell lysis and account for the enhanced tumor clearance. Strikingly, STAT1(-/-) tumor cells acquire increased MHC class I expression upon leukemia progression. These findings define STAT1 as a tumor promoter in leukemia development. Furthermore, we describe the upregulation of MHC class I expression as a general mechanism that allows for the escape of hematopoietic malignancies from immune surveillance.","['Kovacic, Boris', 'Stoiber, Dagmar', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Weisz, Eva', 'Ott, Rene G', 'Kreibich, Rita', 'Levy, David E', 'Beug, Hartmut', 'Freissmuth, Michael', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Kovacic B', 'Stoiber D', 'Moriggl R', 'Weisz E', 'Ott RG', 'Kreibich R', 'Levy DE', 'Beug H', 'Freissmuth M', 'Sexl V']","['Department of Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna (MUW), Vienna A-1090, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/07/18 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-6108(06)00182-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2006.05.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2006 Jul;10(1):77-87. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.05.025.,,,,['Cancer Cell. 2006 Jul;10(1):1-2.

Subsequent analysis identified two additional JAK3 alleles, V722I and P132T, in AMKL patients.

Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition was achieved by means of pharmacological drugs and overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-2. BACKGROUND: Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients and the predominant cause of multiple organ failure. Although precise mechanisms by which sepsis leads to multiple organ dysfunction are unknown, growing evidence suggests that perturbations of key mitochondrial functions, including adenosine triphosphate production, Ca2+ homeostasis, oxygen-derived free radical production, and permeability transition, might be involved in sepsis pathophysiology. METHODS: Heart and lung functions were evaluated respectively by means of isolated heart preparation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung homogenate myeloperoxidase activity, and histopathologic grading. Respiratory fluxes, calcium uptake, and membrane potential were evaluated in isolated heart mitochondria. RESULTS: Peritonitis sepsis induced multiple organ dysfunction, mitochondrial abnormalities, and increased mortality rate, which were reduced by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial transition by cyclosporine derivatives and mitochondrial Bcl-2 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides strong evidence that mitochondrial permeability transition plays a critical role in septic organ dysfunction. These studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis is causative rather than epiphenomenal and relevant in terms of vital organ function and outcome. Regarding the critical role of heart failure in the pathophysiology of septic shock, our study also indicates a potentially new therapeutic approach for treatment of sepsis syndrome.","['Larche, Jerome', 'Lancel, Steve', 'Hassoun, Sidi Mohamed', 'Favory, Raphael', 'Decoster, Brigitte', 'Marchetti, Philippe', 'Chopin, Claude', 'Neviere, Remi']","['Larche J', 'Lancel S', 'Hassoun SM', 'Favory R', 'Decoster B', 'Marchetti P', 'Chopin C', 'Neviere R']","['EA 2689, Universite de Lille 2, Faculte de Medecine 1, Lille, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Coll Cardiol,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,8301365,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intracellular Membranes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria, Heart/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Multiple Organ Failure/metabolism', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/prevention & control', 'Nitrites/blood', 'Peritonitis/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sepsis/metabolism/*physiopathology']",2006/07/18 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0735-1097(06)01131-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.069 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Cardiol. 2006 Jul 18;48(2):377-85. doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.069.

The features of chromosomal abnormalities were linked to the nature of the therapy and protocols used. A considerable proportion of recurrent balanced translocations characterized t-AML secondary to therapy.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate was introduced into the treatment regimen for CML in 1998. During the last few years, reports on chromosomal changes during imatinib treatment have been described. In this study, we evaluated the random aneuploidy rate with chromosomes 9 and 18 in bone marrow from treated and untreated patients. We found higher aneuploidy rates in both treated and untreated patients compared to the control group. In three patients who were treated with imatinib mesylate for more than 1.5 years, triploidy also appeared in some nuclei.

In this study, the growth-inhibiting and immunopotentiating effects of commonly used rice were examined. The growth of human leukemic U937 cells was significantly inhibited by the peripheral blood mononuclear cell-conditioned medium (MNC-CM) derived from water extracts of Japonica rice milled Taiwan 9 (MT9) and brown Taiwan 9 (BT9). Furthermore, these MNC-CMs induced differentiation of U937 cells into mature monocytes/macrophages expressing superoxide-producing and phagocytic activity. The amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in MNC-CMs prepared with MT9 and BT9 were greater than normal MNC-CM. However, growth of U937 cells was not inhibited by normal MNC-CM or rice extracts alone.

METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM based on 321 plasma samples from 59 patients with either chronic myeloid leukaemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The influence of covariates on oral clearance and volume of distribution was examined. Furthermore, the in vivo intracellular pharmacokinetics of imatinib was explored in five patients. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption appropriately described the data, giving a mean (+/-SEM) oral clearance of 14.3 l h-1 (+/-1.0) and a volume of distribution of 347 l (+/-62). Oral clearance was influenced by body weight, age, sex and disease diagnosis. A large proportion of the interindividual variability (36% of clearance and 63% of volume of distribution) remained unexplained by these demographic covariates. Plasma alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentrations had a marked influence on total imatinib concentrations. Moreover, we observed an intra/extracellular ratio of 8, suggesting substantial uptake of the drug into the target cells. CONCLUSION: Because of the high pharmacokinetic variability of imatinib and the reported relationships between its plasma concentration and efficacy and toxicity, the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring as an aid to optimizing therapy should be further investigated. Ideally, such an approach should take account of either circulating alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentrations or free imatinib concentrations.","['Widmer, N', 'Decosterd, L A', 'Csajka, C', 'Leyvraz, S', 'Duchosal, M A', 'Rosselet, A', 'Rochat, B', 'Eap, C B', 'Henry, H', 'Biollaz, J', 'Buclin, T']","['Widmer N', 'Decosterd LA', 'Csajka C', 'Leyvraz S', 'Duchosal MA', 'Rosselet A', 'Rochat B', 'Eap CB', 'Henry H', 'Biollaz J', 'Buclin T']","['Division of ClinicAl Pharmacology, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sex Factors']",2006/07/18 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BCP2719 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02719.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2006 Jul;62(1):97-112. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02719.x.,,,,,PMC1885072,,,['Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2010 Aug;70(2):316'],,,,,,

Unfortunately, its use is associated with the increased risk of development of secondary acute myelogenous leukemias involving translocations at the MLL gene in chromosome band 11q23. Previous studies showed that the phenoxyl radical of etoposide can be generated by myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme prevalent in myeloid progenitor cells that can derive myelogenous leukemias. Disproportionation of this radical leads to formation of the redox active etoposide ortho-quinone metabolite. We hypothesized that etoposide ortho-quinone could therefore form in myeloid progenitor cells and might be a contributor to the development of treatment-related secondary leukemias. Etoposide ortho-quinone is an inherently unstable compound and readily reacts with glutathione in aqueous media without any requirement for catalytic assistance from glutathione S-transferase. We looked for the presence of its glutathione adduct as an indicator of etoposide ortho-quinone in cells. MPO-expressing human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells were treated with etoposide for 0.5 h in the presence and absence of the cosubstrate of MPO, hydrogen peroxide. Cell lysates and medium were analyzed by LC-ESI-ion trap-MS and MS/MS, which yielded clear evidence of the intracellular formation of the etoposide ortho-quinone-glutathione adduct. A stable isotope-labeled form of the GSH adduct was synthesized and employed as an isotope dilution internal standard in LC-ESI-quadrupole-MS analyses. The glutathione adduct level was dependent on the concentration of etoposide added to the cells. More importantly, the formation of the glutathione adduct was significantly suppressed by the pretreatment of HL60 cells with the heme synthesis inhibitor succinylacetone (p < 0.001), which resulted in a decreased level and activity of MPO. These results are consistent with the idea that MPO is responsible for the conversion of etoposide to its ortho-quinone in these cells.","['Fan, Yun', 'Schreiber, Emanuel M', 'Giorgianni, Angela', 'Yalowich, Jack C', 'Day, Billy W']","['Fan Y', 'Schreiber EM', 'Giorgianni A', 'Yalowich JC', 'Day BW']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Proteomics Core Lab, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA090787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Benzoquinones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism']",2006/07/18 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/07/18 09:00'],"['2006/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx0600595 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2006 Jul;19(7):937-43. doi: 10.1021/tx0600595.,,,,,,,,['Chem Res Toxicol. 2007 Jul;20(7):1067'],,,,,,

The number of Tal1-expressing endothelial cells increased significantly but transiently in all the models-hormone-induced ovulation, wound healing and tumour development. Finally, Tal1 protein was detected in the nuclei of newly formed lymphatic endothelial cells in tumour-bearing animals.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the survival of CLL cells is fundamental in achieving this goal. A number of studies indicate that protein kinase C (PKC)- and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)- mediated signalling pathways are central to CLL cell survival, and as such PKC has gained renewed interest as a potential drug target in CLL. This may be because it represents a closely-related family of ten protein kinases, which due to the redundancy that exists between isoforms offers an opportunity for the design of isoform specific inhibitors drugs that target leukaemic cells whilst showing reduced toxicity for normal cells.

We have studied the role and regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in B-CLL cell migration and invasion. Adhesion of B-CLL cells to the fibronectin fragment FN-H89, VCAM-1, or TNF-alpha-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) up-regulated MMP-9 production, measured by gelatin zymography. This effect was mediated by alpha4beta1 integrin and required PI3-K/Akt signaling. The chemokine CXCL12 also up-regulated MMP-9, independently of alpha4beta1 and involving ERK1/2 but not Akt activity. Accordingly, alpha4beta1 engagement activated the PI3-K/Akt/NF-kappaB pathway, while CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction activated ERK1/2/c-Fos signaling. Anti-MMP-9 antibodies, the MMP-9 inhibitor TIMP-1, or transfection with 3 different MMP-9 siRNAs significantly blocked migration through Matrigel or HUVECs. Cell-associated MMP-9 was mainly at the membrane and contained the proactive and mature forms. Moreover, B-CLL cells formed podosomes upon adhesion to FN-H89, VCAM-1, or fibronectin; MMP-9 localized to podosomes in a PI3-K-dependent manner and degraded a fibronectin/gelatin matrix. Our results are the first to show that MMP-9 is physiologically regulated by alpha4beta1 integrin and CXCL12 and plays a key role in cell invasion and transendothelial migration, thus contributing to B-CLL progression. MMP-9 could therefore constitute a target for treatment of this malignancy.","['Redondo-Munoz, Javier', 'Escobar-Diaz, Elizabeth', 'Samaniego, Rafael', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Redondo-Munoz J', 'Escobar-Diaz E', 'Samaniego R', 'Terol MJ', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52404-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-007294 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Nov 1;108(9):3143-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-007294.

In our unselected patient population, 125 of 132 cases could be successfully stimulated for metaphase generation by culture with the immunostimulatory CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 plus interleukin 2. Of 125 cases, 101 showed chromosomal aberrations. The aberration rate is comparable to the rate detected by parallel interphase FISH. In 47 patients, conventional cytogenetics detected additional aberrations not detected by FISH analysis. A complex aberrant karyotype, defined as one having at least 3 aberrations, was detected in 30 of 125 patients, compared with only one such case as defined by FISH. Conventional cytogenetics frequently detected balanced and unbalanced translocations. A significant correlation of the poor-prognosis unmutated IgV(H) status with unbalanced translocations and of the likewise poor-prognosis CD38 expression to balanced translocations and complex aberrant karyotype was found. We demonstrate that FISH analysis underestimates the complexity of chromosomal aberrations in CLL.

We have investigated the effects of basiliolides, a novel class of C19 dilactones isolated from Thapsia garganica, on Ca(2+) mobilization in T cells. Basiliolide A1 induced a rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) in the leukemia T-cell line Jurkat. First, a rapid calcium peak was observed and inhibited by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester. This initial calcium mobilization was followed by a sustained elevation, mediated by the entry of extracellular calcium through store-operated calcium release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels and sensitive to inhibition by EGTA, and by the CRAC channel inhibitor N-{4-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl}-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole -5-carboxamide (BTP-2). Basiliolide A1 mobilized Ca(2+) from ER stores, but in contrast to thapsigargin, it did not induce apoptosis. Basiliolide A1 induced nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 dephosphorylation and activation that was inhibited by BTP-2 and cyclosporine A. In addition, we found that basiliolide A1 alone did not mediate IkappaBalpha degradation or RelA phosphorylation (ser536), but it synergized with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce a complete degradation of the nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitory protein and to activate the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Moreover, basiliolide A1 regulated both interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression at the transcriptional level. In basiliolide B, oxidation of one of the two geminal methyls to a carboxymethyl group retained most of the activity of basiliolide A1. In contrast, basiliolide C, where the 15-carbon is oxidized to an acetoxymethine, was much less active. These findings qualify these compounds as new probes to investigate intracellular calcium homeostasis.","['Navarrete, Carmen', 'Sancho, Rocio', 'Caballero, Francisco J', 'Pollastro, Federica', 'Fiebich, Bernd L', 'Sterner, Olov', 'Appendino, Giovanni', 'Munoz, Eduardo']","['Navarrete C', 'Sancho R', 'Caballero FJ', 'Pollastro F', 'Fiebich BL', 'Sterner O', 'Appendino G', 'Munoz E']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular, Fisiologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Avda. de Menendez Pidal s/n, Universidad de Cordoba, 14004 Cordoba, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apiaceae/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.106.108209 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.106.108209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006 Oct;319(1):422-30. doi: 10.1124/jpet.106.108209.

Generally, MHC I fibers had higher (1.6- to 5.0-fold, P < 0.05) mRNA expression pre- and post-RE. One exception was a higher (1.6- to 3.9-fold, P < 0.05) Bax-to-Bcl-2 mRNA ratio in MHC IIa fibers pre- and post-RE. RE increased (1.4- to 4.8-fold, P < 0.05) MuRF-1 and caspase-3 mRNA levels 4-24 h post-RE in both fiber types, whereas Bax-to-Bcl-2 mRNA ratio increased 2.2-fold (P < 0.05) at 4 h post-RE only in MHC I fibers. These results suggest that MHC I fibers have a greater proteolytic mRNA expression pre- and post-RE compared with MHC IIa fibers. The greatest mRNA induction following RE was in MuRF-1 and caspase-3 in both fiber types. This altered and specific proteolytic mRNA expression among slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers indicates that the ubiquitin/proteasomal and caspase pathways may play an important role in muscle remodeling with RE.","['Yang, Yifan', 'Jemiolo, Bozena', 'Trappe, Scott']","['Yang Y', 'Jemiolo B', 'Trappe S']","['Human Performance Laboratory, Ball State University, Muncie, IN 47306, USA.']",,['eng'],['AG-18409/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",8502536,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch/*metabolism', 'Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch/*metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Quadriceps Muscle/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Weight Lifting/*physiology']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['00438.2006 [pii]', '10.1152/japplphysiol.00438.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Appl Physiol (1985). 2006 Nov;101(5):1442-50. doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00438.2006.

Cells coexpressing alphaGSU and POMC mRNA amounted to 2.6% of the cells in ex vivo rat pituitary at birth [postnatal d 1 (P1)], fell to much lower level at P14, and were undetectable in adulthood. In cultured pituitary aggregates of P14 rats, alphaGSU/POMC cells remained scarce but represented up to 6.6% after chronic treatment with CRH but not leukemia inhibitory factor. CRH was less effective in aggregates from P1 and adult rats. The total alphaGSU population ex vivo at P1 was two times smaller than at P14, but in culture it expanded 2.5 times, concomitantly with a reciprocal change in POMC cell abundance. Tpit transcripts were detected in POMC-only and alphaGSU/POMC cells but not in alphaGSU-only cells. Cells coexpressing alphaGSU and POMC mRNA were relatively abundant in P14 chicken pituitary and aggregate cultures, but occurrence was not affected by CRH. Immunostaining showed alphaGSU and POMC colocalization in sporadic cells in intact rat pituitary and CRH-treated cultures at P1 but not at P14 and adult age. The data demonstrate the occurrence of cells coexpressing alphaGSU and POMC in rat and chicken pituitary. The developmental dynamics of this cell population and its response to CRH in vitro in the rat suggest a relationship of these cells with the embryonic branching of the POMC and alphaGSU cell lineages and their mutually opposite developmental course during early postnatal life.","['Pals, K', 'Boussemaere, M', 'Swinnen, E', 'Vankelecom, H', 'Denef, C']","['Pals K', 'Boussemaere M', 'Swinnen E', 'Vankelecom H', 'Denef C']","['Laboratory of Cell Pharmacology, University of Leuven, Medical School, Campus Gasthuisberg, O & N, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Glycoprotein Hormones, alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Aging/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antimetabolites', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens/*metabolism', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycoprotein Hormones, alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pituitary Gland/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2006-0685 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2006-0685 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2006 Oct;147(10):4738-52. doi: 10.1210/en.2006-0685.

Each 21-bp repeat contains a cAMP-responsive-element core flanked by 5' G-rich and 3' C-rich sequences. Tax alone does not bind DNA. Rather, it interacts with basic domain-leucine zipper transcription factors CREB and ATF-1 to form ternary complexes with the 21-bp repeats. In the context of the ternary complexes, Tax contacts the G/C-rich sequences and recruits transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 to effect potent transcriptional activation. Using an easily transduced and chromosomally integrated reporter system derived from a self-inactivating lentivirus vector, we showed in a BRG1- and BRM1-deficient adrenal carcinoma cell line, SW-13, that Tax- and 21-bp repeat-mediated transactivation does not require BRG1 or BRM1 and is not enhanced by BRG1. With a similar reporter system, we further demonstrated that Tax- and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation occurs readily in SW-13 cells in the absence of BRG1 and BRM1. These results suggest that the assembly of stable multiprotein complexes containing Tax, CREB/ATF-1, and CBP/p300 on the 21-bp repeats is the principal mechanism employed by Tax to preclude nucleosome formation at the HTLV-1 enhancer/promoter. This most likely bypasses the need for BRG1-containing chromatin-remodeling complexes. Likewise, recruitment of CBP/p300 by NF-kappaB may be sufficient to disrupt histone-DNA interaction for the initiation of transcription.","['Zhang, Ling', 'Liu, Meihong', 'Merling, Randall', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Zhang L', 'Liu M', 'Merling R', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd., Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",,['eng'],"['F32 GM075688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA048709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 48709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA/GM 75688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Adrenocortical Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/15/7459 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00130-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Aug;80(15):7459-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00130-06.,,,,,PMC1563696,,,,,,,,,

Elevation in the proviral load is associated with serious HTLV-1-mediated diseases, such as adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. However, it remains controversial whether HTLV-1-specific T-cell immunity can control HTLV-1 in vivo. We previously reported that orally HTLV-1-infected rats showed insufficient HTLV-1-specific T-cell immunity that coincided with elevated levels of the HTLV-1 proviral load. In the present study, we found that individual HTLV-1 proviral loads established in low-responding hosts could be reduced by the restoration of HTLV-1-specific T-cell responses. Despite the T-cell unresponsiveness for HTLV-1 in orally infected rats, an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction in the splenocytes and a contact hypersensitivity response in the skin of these rats were comparable with those of naive rats. HTLV-1-specific T-cell response in orally HTLV-1-infected rats could be restored by subcutaneous reimmunization with mitomycin C (MMC)-treated syngeneic HTLV-1-transformed cells. The reimmunized rats exhibited lower proviral loads than untreated orally infected rats. We also confirmed that the proviral loads in orally infected rats decreased after reimmunization in the same hosts. Similar T-cell immune conversion could be reproduced in orally HTLV-1-infected rats by subcutaneous inoculation with MMC-treated primary T cells from syngeneic orally HTLV-1-infected rats. The present results indicate that, although HTLV-1-specific T-cell unresponsiveness is an underlying risk factor for the propagation of HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo, the risk may potentially be reduced by reimmunization, for which autologous HTLV-1-infected cells are a candidate immunogen.","['Komori, Kazuya', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Kurihara, Kiyoshi', 'Honda, Takayuki', 'Yokozeki, Hiroo', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Komori K', 'Hasegawa A', 'Kurihara K', 'Honda T', 'Yokozeki H', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Immunization', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Proviruses', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Skin/drug effects/immunology/virology', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology/virology', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/virology', '*Viral Load']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/15/7375 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00230-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Aug;80(15):7375-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00230-06.,,,,,PMC1563733,,,,,,,,,

Old World monkey TRIM5alpha blocks human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity, and the human and New World monkey TRIM5alpha proteins are inactive against HIV-1 but active against divergent murine (N-tropic murine leukemia virus [MLV-N]) and simian (simian immunodeficiency virus from rhesus macaque [SIVmac]) retroviruses, respectively. Here we demonstrate antiviral activity of the first nonprimate TRIM protein, from cattle, active against divergent retroviruses, including HIV-1. The number of closely related human TRIM sequences makes assignment of the bovine sequence as a TRIM5alpha ortholog uncertain, and we therefore refer to it as bovine Lv1. Bovine Lv1 is closely related to primate TRIM5alpha proteins in the N-terminal RING and B-box 2 domains but significantly less homologous in the C-terminal B30.2 domain, particularly in the region shown to influence antiviral specificity. Intriguingly, some viruses restricted by bovine Lv1, including HIV-1 and MLV-N, are unable to synthesize viral DNA by reverse transcription, whereas restricted HIV-2 makes normal amounts of DNA. The data support the conclusion that TRIM protein-mediated restriction of retroviral infection is a more common attribute of mammals than previously appreciated.","['Ylinen, Laura M J', 'Keckesova, Zuzana', 'Webb, Benjamin L J', 'Gifford, Robert J M', 'Smith, Timothy P L', 'Towers, Greg J']","['Ylinen LM', 'Keckesova Z', 'Webb BL', 'Gifford RJ', 'Smith TP', 'Towers GJ']","['Department of Infection, Royal Free and University College Medical School, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London W1T4JF, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],['076608/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platyrrhini', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/15/7332 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00516-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Aug;80(15):7332-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00516-06.,,,,,PMC1563707,['GENBANK/DQ380509'],,,,,,,,

In order to perform molecular characterization in the diagnostics and monitoring of lymphoid malignancies, leukemias and lymphomas in Tunisia, we have introduced the use of chemiluminescent probes for immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) gene rearrangement detection employing the Southern blot method. The chemiluminescent and radioactive detection methods tested with alkaline phosphatase and 32P labelled probes, respectively, were used for the IG and TR gene rearrangement characterization. Our results show the same pattern of rearrangement. Moreover, the chemiluminescent signal is detected faster and it is as sensitive as the radioactive one. We report the optimized conditions for using IGH, IGK, IGL, TRB and TRG probes in non radioactive detection. We have applied the chemiluminescent Southern blot method to analyze examples of Tunisian leukemias and lymphomas. The results allowed the assessment of clonality and the T or B cell lineage of these cases. The use of non radioactive probes makes chemiluminescent Southern blot detection reliable, safe and sensitive.

It has been demonstrated that younger patients can maintain longer complete remissions (CR) with aggressive post-remission therapies after induction treatment: allogeneic (allo), autologous (auto) stem cell transplantation (SCT), or intensive chemotherapy (ICC). The purpose of our study was to identify the most important randomized and controlled studies comparing these three therapeutic options, in order to draw conclusions and possible suggestions for post-remission therapy of AML, according to the evidence based medicine (EBM) rules. We performed an exhaustive analysis of the literature, searching either in electronic databases or among the references of the identified articles (hand searching). We searched the MEDLINE computer database for reports from 1985 through January 2005 and selected for analysis the clinical trials conducted over adults affected by newly diagnosed AML aged less than 65 years. The study design had to satisfy strict methodological criteria and must consider global mortality and/or disease free survival as primary outcomes. Overall we found 7750 papers; by using the limits ""clinical trial"" as publication type, ""all adults 19+ years"", we were able to select 344 papers. Among these, a further selection was made, based on two main clinical queries: 1) is auto-SCT superior to ICC/no other therapy in improving DFS and/or OS in adult AML patients in first CR? 2) is allo-SCT superior to auto-SCT/other therapeutic options in improving DFS and/or OS in adult AML patients in first CR? Concerning the first query, a possible advantage of auto-SCT over ICC was not clearly supported by data from clinical trials; there is no evidence that auto-SCT is superior in terms of OS to chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the reported TRM has been significantly reduced within the past years. Thus, the percentage of patients suitable for auto-SCT in CR has increased. Moreover, the scarce data concerning the comparison between auto-SCT and chemotherapy in different subsets of patients are unable to suggest a differentiated approach in patients with high-risk, standard-risk or low-risk AML. Data from the literature show that patients with unfavorable risk disease are more often addressed to allo-SCT and patients with low-risk disease receive more often intensive consolidation chemotherapy. Concerning the second query, interpretation of data from the main prospective studies about the role of allo-SCT in previously untreated AML is not easy. The first problem is the lack of real randomized clinical trials; in fact, according to the reported studies, AML patients generally receive allo-SCT on the basis of donor availability (the so called ""genetic randomization""). The second problem is the frequent absence of intention to treat analysis. Despite methodological limitations, it was possible to compare allo-SCT with auto-SCT on a donor versus no-donor analysis and within risk groups. No overall benefit of allo-grafting on survival was demonstrated by any trial. In conclusion, the EBM approach highlighted the limitations observed in the published studies concerning consolidation therapy in AML; some suggestions, emerging from non-randomized, as well as randomized studies, are adequate, but not conclusive. This point, coupled with the intrinsic complexity to study AML biological heterogeneity, is probably a major obstacle to draw conclusive evidences for consolidation therapy in AML. These observations should plan to address new randomized studies on AML therapy; however, due to the emergence of genetic subgroups and new drugs targeting specific abnormalities, these trials should probably be designed directly focusing on the single entities. In this way, the cure of AML could eventually become the cure of each specific AML subset with its peculiar biological, molecular and prognostic features.","['Visani, G', 'Olivieri, A', 'Malagola, M', 'Brunori, M', 'Piccaluga, P P', 'Capelli, D', 'Pomponio, G', 'Martinelli, G', 'Isidori, A', 'Sparaventi, G', 'Leoni, P']","['Visani G', 'Olivieri A', 'Malagola M', 'Brunori M', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Capelli D', 'Pomponio G', 'Martinelli G', 'Isidori A', 'Sparaventi G', 'Leoni P']","['Hematology, San Salvatore Hospital, Pesaro, Italy. pesarohematology@yahoo.it']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Research Design', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['VQ48V6146756V8R7 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500513595 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):1091-102. doi: 10.1080/10428190500513595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Withholding the drug or application of growth factors is recommended in this situation. This study introduced a novel approach using intermittent dosage of IM in order to avoid prolonged interruptions in therapy, to allow spontaneous recovery in blood count and, simultaneously, to achieve intermittently therapeutic plasma drug levels. A retrospective analysis of intermittent therapy (iT) in 12 patients with CML is presented. All patients had intermediate-to-high prognostic scores. Two patients had history of autologous stem cell transplantation. Initial standard therapy with IM was indicated for resistance to interferon (eight subjects) and for accelerated phase in four cases (one of them cytogenetic) and lasted for 1 - 6 months. iT with 300 - 600 mg of IM 1 - 5 times a week was started after significant hematologic toxicity occurred. In three patients treated 3 - 5 times a week, hematologic recovery allowed reintroduction of full dose after 3 - 7 (mean 4.6) months. In three patients, one-to-three doses per week were sufficient to maintain the cytogenetic response for a mean of 30.6 months (range 29 - 33). Six patients tolerated more frequent dosage of 4 - 5 times a week for a mean of 17.8 months (range 3 - 28). Five patients improved their cytogenetic response during iT, while hematologic progression occurred in one patient. Development of a cytogenetic abnormality in a Ph-negative clone was observed in one patient. Overall, two complete and five major cytogenetic responses were achieved. The sensitivity of Bcr/Abl kinase to inhibition by IM was proved in seven patients tested by Crkl phosphorylation assay. Measurement of plasma IM concentrations in three subjects showed concentrations fully compatible with the dosage applied suggesting normal intestinal absorption. iT with IM is a feasible and safe strategy for short-time 'bridging' management of patients with significant hematologic toxicity after standard daily dosing. Long-term iT with IM does not seem to compromise the cytogenetic response in patients with sensitivity of Bcr/Abl kinase to IM and should be considered as a plausible treatment option in patients with persistent signs of myelotoxicity.","['Faber, Edgar', 'Nausova, Jitka', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Egorin, Merrill J', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Rozmanova, Sarka', 'Maresova, Ivana', 'Divoky, Vladimir', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Faber E', 'Nausova J', 'Jarosova M', 'Egorin MJ', 'Holzerova M', 'Rozmanova S', 'Maresova I', 'Divoky V', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc and Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic. faber@fnol.cz']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 74588)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['J873L38U2V641NLP [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600565057 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):1082-90. doi: 10.1080/10428190600565057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated weighted odds ratio for the survival of those who achieved an MCR when compared with those who did not was 7 (95% CI 5 - 11) at 2 years and 5 (95% CI 3 - 8) at 4 years. Four long-term survival models were subsequently constructed. All models were found to be robust to variations in the data included. Model D was favored using the 'Ockham's razor' principle; it suggests that the median survival may be increased by 1.8 years for every 25 percentage point increase in MCR rate. The results support the use of the proportion of patients with CML in the chronic phase with an MCR to estimate overall long-term survival.,"['Schrover, Rudolf J', 'Adena, Michael A', 'De Abreu Lourenco, Richard', 'Prince, H Miles', 'Seymour, John F', 'Wonder, Michael J']","['Schrover RJ', 'Adena MA', 'De Abreu Lourenco R', 'Prince HM', 'Seymour JF', 'Wonder MJ']","['Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd.

D. Anderson Cancer Center Series.,1062-8,"The present study aimed to investigate single-agent liposomal all-trans retinoic acid (Lipo-ATRA) in untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Induction therapy consisted of Lipo-ATRA 90 mg/m2 i.v. every other day. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued to receive Lipo-ATRA 90 mg/m2 i.v. three times a week for 9 months. Idarubicin was added only if a polymerase chain reaction test for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (sensitivity level, 10(-4)), performed every 3 months from CR, was positive. The results were compared with those of a historical control group treated with oral ATRA and idarubicin. Lipo-ATRA induced CR in 79% of patients; CR rates were 92% and 38% in patients with white blood cell (WBC) counts <10 x 10(9)/L and >10 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Ten of the 26 responders to Lipo-ATRA remain in first CR at a median of 6.4 years, despite never receiving idarubicin; all 10 had initial WBC counts <10 x 10(9)/L. The 5-year survival rate was 76% for patients treated with Lipo-ATRA. Comparisons with oral ATRA+idarubicin as given at M. D. Anderson are confounded because of their historical nature and the absence of ATRA from post-remission therapy in the former group. Nonetheless, a multivariate Cox model identified higher WBC counts and older age, but not treatment (historical vs. Lipo-ATRA), as being predictive of shorter relapse-free and overall survival. Lipo-ATRA can cure patients presenting with WBC counts <10 x 10(9)/L (low risk) without additional therapy, contrary to conventional ATRA, which, when given alone, probably cures no patients. The observation that patients can be cured of APL without the use of chemotherapy should encourage further study of 'targeted' therapy in APL and in other leukemias.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Tirado-Gomez, Maribel', 'Andreeff, Michael', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Tirado-Gomez M', 'Andreeff M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Lopez-Berestein G', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA. atsimber@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Texas', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['K54M427781W6874X [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500463932 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):1062-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190500463932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and ADAM29 may serve as novel prognostic markers in B-CLL. To investigate the prognostic value of these genes, we quantified their expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in a cohort of 133 B-CLL patients and correlated the results with clinical outcome, and other known prognostic factors. LPL, ADAM29, LPL and ADAM29 ratios, as well as CD38 and ZAP-70 protein expression determined by multiparameter flow cytometry, were predictive of treatment-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified LPL, ADAM29 and CD38 as independent prognostic markers. Evaluation of several disease characteristics in association with the LPL expression status of the patients' B-CLL cells showed highly significant differences for CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, suggesting a correlation of LPL expression with these established adverse prognostic factors. Sequential RQ-PCR analyses in a subset of 22 patients revealed that LPL mRNA expression was relatively stable in the majority of patients, whereas ADAM29 expression levels varied substantially over time. Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis, LPL provided prognostic information in both early stage (Binet A) and patients with more advanced disease (Binet B and C). Conversely, high ADAM29 expression was predictive of a long treatment-free interval in Binet stage A but did not retain its prognostic significance in Binet B and C patients. The LPL/ADAM29 expression ratio was not found to be an independent prognostic factor and did not offer any advantages over the use of LPL alone. Collectively, our data confirm a role for LPL as a novel prognostic indicator in B-CLL.","['Nuckel, Holger', 'Huttmann, Andreas', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Schroers, Roland', 'Fuhrer, Anja', 'Sellmann, Ludger', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Durig, Jan']","['Nuckel H', 'Huttmann A', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Schroers R', 'Fuhrer A', 'Sellmann L', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany. holger.nueckel@uni-essen.de']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM29 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['J677626182463613 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500464161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):1053-61. doi: 10.1080/10428190500464161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, information dealing with the evaluation of soluble syndecan-1 in CLL are lacking. We measured syndecan-1 concentrations in serum drawn at the time of diagnosis from 67 B-cell CLL patients (Binet stage A, 46; stage B, 7; stage C, 14). For this purpose a syndecan-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Diaclone, Besancon, France) was used. Detectable levels of syndecan-1 were found in all patients, although serum concentrations were significantly lower in CLL patients in comparison to age- and sex-matched controls (P = 0.02; Mann-Whitney test). No correlation was found with Binet clinical stages (P = 0.796), beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.923), hemoglobin level (P = 0.605), platelet count (P = 0.992) and lymphocyte doubling time (P = 0.709). Only an association with absolute peripheral blood lymphocytosis (PBL) (P = 0.01) and LDH (P = 0.05) could be detected. Serum levels of syndecan-1 did not parallel those of several angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (P = 0.963), basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF-2) (P = 0.216), angiogenin (P = 0.478), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (P = 0.125) as well as bone marrow (BM) microvessel density (P = 0.110). The same applied with adhesion molecules such as CD54 (P = 0.233), CD108 (P = 0.799), CD44 (P = 0.816) and CD31 (P = 0.508). Interestingly, the inverse correlation (r = -0.4967; P = 0.03) between serum concentrations of syndecan-1 and plasma levels of stromal derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1) is in keeping with the different function, respectively, pro- and anti-apoptotic, of these molecules. In 46 Binet stage A patients, serum levels of syndecan-1 were further evaluated as a dichotomous variable with respect to progression-free survival (PFS), an end-point surrogate for overall survival in early B-cell CLL. The best separation of curves was seen with a cut-off point at the median value of syndecan-1 (i.e. 36.5 pg/ml). Median PFS was not reached in the patient group with low syndecan-1, compared to a median of 34 months observed in the remaining patients (P = 0.018; HR = 0.208; 95% CI = 0.115 - 0.816). At the multivariate analysis performed including variables significant in the univariate analysis [i.e. PBL (P = 0.03) and syndecan-1 (P = 0.01)], only syndecan-1 retained a trend of significance (P = 0.08). Despite the pro-angiogenic activity of syndecan-1 which mediates FGF-2 binding and activity, no correlation with either angiogenic cytokines or the extent of BM angiogenesis was found in CLL. The inverse correlation with plasma levels of SDF-1 suggests an involvement in the processes leading to apoptosis. Finally, our results highlight the involvement of syndecan-1 in the mechanisms of disease-progression of early CLL.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Vitelli, Gaetano', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Digiesu, Giovanna', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Ribatti, Domenico', 'Vacca, Angelo']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Mirabelli R', 'Digiesu G', 'Giannarelli D', 'Cuneo A', 'Ribatti D', 'Vacca A']","['Medical Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Syndecan-1)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Syndecan-1/*blood']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['V9X82Q1342V77840 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500470358 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):1034-40. doi: 10.1080/10428190500470358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, acquired mutations in the megakaryocytic regulator GATA1 have been found in essentially all cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) in children with Down syndrome and in the closely related malignancy transient myeloproliferative disorder. In all cases, mutations in GATA1 lead to the expression of a shorter isoform of GATA-1, named GATA-1s. Because GATA-1s retains both DNA binding zinc fingers, but is missing the N-terminal transactivation domain, it has been predicted that the inability of GATA-1s to regulate its normal class of megakaryocytic target genes is the mechanism by which mutations in GATA1 contribute to the disease. Indeed, several recent reports have confirmed that GATA-1s fails to properly regulate the growth of megakaryocytic precursors, likely through aberrant transcriptional regulation. Although the specific target genes of GATA-1 mis-regulated by GATA-1s that drive this abnormal growth remain undefined, multiple candidate genes have been identified via gene array studies. Finally, the inability of GATA-1s to promote expression of important metabolic genes, such as cytadine deaminase, likely contributes to the remarkable hypersensitivity of AMkL blasts to cytosine arabinoside. Future studies to define the entire class of genes dysregulated by mutations in GATA1 will provide important insights into the etiology of these malignancies.","['Muntean, Andrew G', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Crispino, John D']","['Muntean AG', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW', 'Crispino JD']","['Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101774-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA092308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA/chemistry', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*complications/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Zinc Fingers']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['T37152478864Q42X [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500485810 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jun;47(6):986-97. doi: 10.1080/10428190500485810.,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the frequency of the TNF-alpha -824G allele, which has been associated with low transcription activity of the promoter/predicted enhancer region of the bovine TNF-alpha gene, was higher in individuals with BLV-induced lymphoma than in asymptomatic carrier individuals. In addition, we observed a tendency for increased BLV-provirus load in cattle with TNF-alpha -824G/G homozygote compared to TNF-alpha -824A/A homozygote or TNF-alpha -824A/G.

Cellular subpopulations were exposed to different triggers (H(2)O(2), UV-B, alpha-TOS and hrTRAIL) and the extent of apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. Our data showed that, in lymphoma cells, propensity to apoptosis was significantly linked to CD38 expression and that, remarkably, such response was independent of the nature of the trigger used. Inhibition of CD38 expression by antisense oligonucleotides treatment resulted in CD38-silenced fractions which were as prone to apoptosis as CD38(-) ones.

It is characterized at cytogenetic level by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and at the molecular level by the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are also pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues. To date, no study has been performed to characterize whether MSCs from CML harbor the abnormal Ph chromosome similar to CML bone marrow cells. We isolated and characterized MSCs from diagnostic marrow samples (n=11) and showed that MSCs can be readily isolated from CML marrow and exhibit major expansion potential as well as intact osteogenic differentiation ability. Moreover, they do not harbor the Ph chromosome confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thus, we demonstrated that CML marrow is an abundant source of MSCs appearing through both FISH and RT-PCR not to be involved by the malignant process of CML. Furthermore, these MSCs from a CML patient could support in vitro cord blood expansion as those MSCs from a normal donor. Since MSCs are able to support engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells in stem cell transplantation (SCT) as well as suppress alloreactive T cells causing graft-versus-host disease, this current report thus provides evidence that in a SCT setting of CML patients, autologous MSCs could be a source of stem cell support in future cell therapy applications.","['Jootar, Saengsuree', 'Pornprasertsud, Nida', 'Petvises, Sawang', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Busaba', 'Disthabanchong, Sinee', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Ungkanont, Artit', 'Hongeng, Suradej']","['Jootar S', 'Pornprasertsud N', 'Petvises S', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Disthabanchong S', 'Pakakasama S', 'Ungkanont A', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",2006/07/15 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00149-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Dec;30(12):1493-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.04.013.

The latter, though, could downregulate this cellular response by shedding prothrombotic membrane elements, for example, integrins and TF. To test this hypothesis, etoposide-treated, apoptotic, monocytic cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line [THP-1]) were examined for rolling and adhesion on adherent platelets and for TF expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Etoposide treatment did not result in a significant change in TF antigen expression. However, TF activity, measured in a continuous factor Xa generation assay, was increased fivefold concomitantly with increased exposure of PtdSer. Laminar flow adhesion assays specific for interaction between P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) revealed that in contrast to non-treated cells, apoptotic cells did not roll or firmly attach on adherent platelets. Lack of apoptotic THP-1 platelet interaction could be attributed to both a loss of cell surface-expressed PSGL-1 and loss of functional PSGL-1 as a result of disruption of the binding of PSGL-1 with the cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Etoposide-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells evokes a procoagulant response by increasing TF activity associated with an increased PtdSer exposure. However, in contrast to TF, PSGL-1 shedding and loss of function, makes that apoptotic monocytes are unlikely involved in a thrombotic action because of their inability to adhere to an injured vessel wall or developing thrombus.","['van Genderen, H', 'Wielders, S J H', 'Lindhout, T', 'Reutelingsperger, C P M']","['van Genderen H', 'Wielders SJ', 'Lindhout T', 'Reutelingsperger CP']","['Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, 6200 MD Maastricht, the Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Rolling', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*deficiency/physiology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/analysis', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/10/07 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JTH2004 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02004.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2006 Jul;4(7):1611-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02004.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Population data were analysed using relative survival methods and hospital registry data using disease-specific survival. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with first-line chemotherapy. RESULTS: South Australia recorded 1,572 new cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 1977-2002, together with 536 cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Of these cases, 42.6% were recorded in teaching hospital registries. The five-year survival for AML at the teaching hospitals of 14.5% was similar to the corresponding 12.0% for South Australia as a whole. The five-year survival for CML at these hospitals was higher, however, at 48.1% compared with 37.5% for all South Australian cases. Younger patients had higher survivals, both for AML and CML. An increase in survival was evident for more recently diagnosed cases for both leukaemia types, after adjusting for age. This increase in survival was accompanied by an increase over time in the proportion of patients at teaching hospitals having a primary course of chemotherapy. Cytarabine in combination with other agents was the most common induction therapy for AML. While hydroxyurea was the most common first-line treatment of CML, there were changes in clinical policies towards higher-dose treatments, plus trials of new agents and combination therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Secular gains in survival have occurred from AML and CML in association with an increased use of chemotherapy.","['Luke, Colin', 'Nguyen, Anh-Minh Azhar', 'To, Bik', 'Seshadri, Ram', 'Hughes, Tim', 'Bardy, Peter', 'Colbeck, Margaret', 'Buranyi-Trevarton, Dianne', 'McMellon, Maureen', 'Roder, David']","['Luke C', 'Nguyen AM', 'To B', 'Seshadri R', 'Hughes T', 'Bardy P', 'Colbeck M', 'Buranyi-Trevarton D', 'McMellon M', 'Roder D']","['Epidemiology Branch, Department of Health, Adelaide, SA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'South Australia/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2006 Apr-Jun;7(2):227-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various morphological and molecular changes undergoing during the process of apoptosis are the formation of apoptotic blebs of the cell membrane, cell shrinkage, condensation of chromatin and the disruption of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into typical fragments of multiples of 180 base pairs. These changes can be detected in a number of ways. DNA ladder formation, which is observed following gel electrophoresis technique although is widely accepted but does not reflect the DNA breakdown in individual cell and also may miss contributions from small sub-populations in a heterogeneous cell population. Alkaline comet assay as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis, on the other hand, accurately measures DNA fragmentation on a single cell level and allows analysis of subpopulation of cells. The assay was originally developed for measuring DNA damage of cells exposed to any genotoxic agent. However, the comet image generated by an apoptotic cell is different from that obtained with a cell treated for a short time with a genotoxic agent. Correlation of comet formation with various other established parameters of apoptosis is very important. The present study aims to correlate different features of apoptosis with the formation of comet tail in human leukemia K-562 cells using tea extracts. Apoptosis as measured by formation of apoptotic bodies, flow cytometric analysis, activation of caspase 3 and 8, and expressions of apoptosis related genes such as bcl-2 and bax showed high degree of correlation with comet tail moment. This indicates that comet assay can accurately reflect measure of DNA fragmentation and hence can be used to detect a cell undergoing apoptosis.","['Chakraborty, Sutapa', 'Kundu, Trina', 'Dey, Subhabrata', 'Bhattacharya, Rathin K', 'Siddiqi, Maqsood', 'Roy, Madhumita']","['Chakraborty S', 'Kundu T', 'Dey S', 'Bhattacharya RK', 'Siddiqi M', 'Roy M']","['Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology Department, Chittaranjan, National Cancer Institute, Kolkata 700 026, India.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', '*Camellia sinensis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Comet Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', '*Plant Extracts', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2006/07/15 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/07/15 09:00'],"['2006/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2006 Apr-Jun;7(2):201-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the literature, 1-10% of B-CLL patients develop this high-grade lymphoid malignancy.

We describe a CLL patient who developed a large B cell lymphoma 94 months after diagnosis and 3 months after the start of alemtuzumab. The CLL immunophenotype was retained by the transforming cells although a different light chain was expressed. Molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain confirmed that the CLL and the RS had a different clonal origin. Subsequent molecular analyses of stored samples showed that the clone with transforming capacity already appeared two years before the clinical appearance of the RS. We hypothesize that alemtuzumab promoted the uncontrolled growth of the latest clone by eradicating the initial B-CLL clone efficiently, and by inducing a strong T cell depletion with consequent impairment of the immunosurveillance.

We therefore performed a retrospective review to determine the outcome of patients with hematological malignancies and acute respiratory failure who received inhaled nitric oxide (INO) in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a single tertiary referral medical center. Thirteen patients with hematological malignancies who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and received INO for acute respiratory failure between January 1998 and December 2002 were identified. Mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 47.6 (+/-13.2) years. The mean +/- SD Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score on the day of ICU admission was 94.1 +/- 33.7 with a mean (SD) predicted probability of ICU death of 42.4% (+/-28.6).

The median duration of INO therapy was 41.8 h (interquartile range, 6.3-98.2). Patients with hematological malignancies and acute respiratory failure to whom INO was administered had clinical deterioration since ICU admission.

Using 10 different SNP gene loci, the SNP-PCR method was able to discriminate patient from donor cells in 125 of 135 cases (93%), whereas the use of 11 different STR gene loci with the STR-PCR analysis using agarose or polyacrylamide gel resolution resulted in accurate donor-host discrimination in all patients. Of the 470 analyzed samples we found in 74% concordant results for both chimerism methods. In all 26% discordant cases the SNP-chimerism method showed mixed chimerism (MC), whereas the STR-method found complete chimerism (CC). As a consequence, the SNP-PCR chimerism analysis method detected a MC prior to the occurrence of relapse significantly earlier than the STR-PCR chimerism method (120 vs. 30 days, P < 0.007). The probability of relapses was significantly higher in patients with increasing MC (70%) compared to 30% in patients with CC (P < 0.00001) associated with a significantly shorter overall survival in patients with increasing MC. The multivariate Cox model showed that chimerism analsis with SNP-PCR was the only significant risk factor predicting relapse (RR 6.08, P < 0.0001).Furthermore, we analyzed the chimerism status in male recipients with a female donor in 580 samples of 134 patients using quantitative real-time PCR of Y-chromosome-specific sequences and compared the results with interphase XY-fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). MC without signs of relapse was detected in 35% of samples using quantitative real-time PCR of Y-chromosome-specific sequences. The detected Y-DNA amounts were low compared to the amounts detected in 104 samples of 42 patients with leukemic relapse at the time of analysis (P < 0.0001). Quantitative real-time PCR of Y-chromosome-specific sequences detected therefore an increasing MC with high residual host DNA amounts approximately 143 days (mean) prior to the occurrence of relapse. By comparing the results of Y-chromosome PCR with the XY-FISH analysis we found concordant results in 73% in patients with myeloablative regimens. The XY-FISH could detect 12 relapses, whereas the Y-chromosome PCR detect 36 relapses by MC (P < 0.005). Residual host cells gradually decreased during the posttransplant period from a mean of 5.4 ng (first months) to 0.5 ng (above 5 years) without evidence of relapses. The probability of relapses was significantly higher in patients with increasing MC (100%) compared to 8% in patients with CC (P < 0.00001) associated with a significantly shorter overall survival in patients with increasing MC. The multivariate Cox model showed that chimerism analysis of Y-chromosome-specific sequences is an important risk factor for relapse (RR 17.0, P < 0.0001). We conclude that the use of real-time SNP or Y-PCR may be superior to the STR-PCR or interphase XY-FISH methods in detecting patients who are at high risk for relapse after transplant.","['Koldehoff, Michael', 'Steckel, Nina K', 'Hlinka, Michal', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']","['Koldehoff M', 'Steckel NK', 'Hlinka M', 'Beelen DW', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany. michael.koldehoff@uni-essen.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Sex-Determining Region Y Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA/genetics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Determination Analysis/methods', 'Sex-Determining Region Y Protein/genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/14 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20693 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2006 Oct;81(10):735-46. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we characterize lymphomas from Notch1IC transgenic rats, which develop T-ALL shortly after weaning, and show that they display a number of previously undocumented features. Starting from monoclonal thymic tumors, the CD4(+)CD8alphaalpha(+) lymphoma cells infiltrate the bone marrow and then spread to secondary lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. However, major hallmarks of T-ALL cells in other murine models and human patients, such as constitutive NF-kappaB activity and increased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, are remarkably absent in Notch1IC lymphomas. In contrast, CD30, a classic marker of Hodgkin lymphomas, is overexpressed in these tumors. Intriguingly, enforced Notch1 signaling up-regulates expression of Notch3, which has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. By blocking endogenous Notch signaling, we could demonstrate that Notch1IC is sufficient to induce sustained preTCR expression in transgenic thymocytes but not for their progression to the double-positive stage. This suggests that other Notch activities may also contribute to the phenotype of the transgenic rats. In summary, we anticipate this new animal model will help to further elucidate the role of Notch1 in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.","['van den Brandt, Jens', 'Kwon, Soon-Hwan', 'McPherson, Kirsty G', 'Petrovic, Suzana', 'Zettl, Andreas', 'Muller-Hermelink, Hans Konrad', 'Reichardt, Holger M']","['van den Brandt J', 'Kwon SH', 'McPherson KG', 'Petrovic S', 'Zettl A', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Reichardt HM']","['Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Notch1 protein, rat)', '0 (Notch3 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200535791 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Aug;36(8):2223-34. doi: 10.1002/eji.200535791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to demonstrate the noninferiority of monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, compared with cefepime. METHODS: We conducted a randomized-controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trial among high-risk patients from 34 university-affiliated tertiary care medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia who were undergoing treatment for leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were hospitalized for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes. Patients received piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h) or cefepime (2 g every 8 h) intravenously. The primary outcome was success (defined by defervescence without treatment modification) at 72 h of treatment, end of treatment, and test of cure in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to defervescence, microbiological efficacy, the additional use of glycopeptide antibiotics, emergence of resistant bacteria, and safety. RESULTS: For 528 subjects (265 received piperacillin-tazobactam and 263 received cefepime), success rates were 57.7% and 48.3%, respectively (P = .04) at the 72-h time point, 39.6% and 31.6% (P = .06) at end of treatment, and 26.8% and 20.5% (P = .11) at the test-of-cure visit. The analyses demonstrated noninferiority for piperacillin-tazobactam at all time points (P< or = .0001). Treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was independently associated with treatment success in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.64; P = .035). Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the noninferiority and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, compared with cefepime, for the empirical treatment of high-risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.","['Bow, E J', 'Rotstein, C', 'Noskin, G A', 'Laverdiere, M', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Segal, B H', 'Seymour, J F', 'Szer, J', 'Sanche, S']","['Bow EJ', 'Rotstein C', 'Noskin GA', 'Laverdiere M', 'Schwarer AP', 'Segal BH', 'Seymour JF', 'Szer J', 'Sanche S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. ebow@hsc.mb.ca']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Penicillanic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID38991 [pii]', '10.1086/505393 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2006 Aug 15;43(4):447-59. doi: 10.1086/505393.

Moreover, these cells could be used to develop innovative strategies in the field of transplantation and particularly to prevent graft-vs-host disease. Indeed, high numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) immunoregulatory T cells can modulate graft-vs-host disease if administered at the same time as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in mice.

SA has been used to downregulate the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) through its specific inhibition of heme biosynthesis and to investigate the biological properties of MPO in the human myeloid leukemic (HL-60) cell line. The goal of this study is to evaluate the mutagenic potential of SA by determining the frequencies of somatic mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) reporter gene in HL-60 cells following treatment with the chemical. Treatments of HL-60 cells with 500 micromol/L SA for 72 h, a condition generally used to inhibit the MPO activity, resulted in a significantly increased HPRT mutant frequency (HPRT-Mf), compared with the control of untreated cells (47.25 x 10(-6) versus 7.5 x 10(-6), respectively, p <0.01). Treatment of the cells with lower doses of SA also led to an increase in HPRT-Mf but this was significant only with 200 micromol/L (28.67 x 10(-6), p<0.05) and not with doses lower than 100 micromol/L (p0.05), compared with the control of untreated cells (7.5 x 10(-6)). These data show a dose-response increase in HPRT-Mf in HL-60 cells treated with SA, suggesting that this chemical causes mutations in the HPRT locus in these cells either directly or indirectly through its inhibition of the MPO activity.","['Zheng, K-C', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Kagan, V E', 'Keohavong, P']","['Zheng KC', 'Yalowich JC', 'Kagan VE', 'Keohavong P']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219-3130, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA90787-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heptanoates/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mutation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2006/07/14 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2004/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10565-006-0171-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2006 Sep;22(5):361-70. doi: 10.1007/s10565-006-0171-4.

However, the role of B cells, the primary players in the humoral immune response, during HCV infection is largely unknown. To explore the molecular effects of HCV core on human B cells, we conducted gene expression profiling of serial RNA samples from B cells that were infected with adenovirus harboring full-length HCV core protein and beta-galactosidase as a reference using a microarray platform containing 22,149 human oligo probes. The entire experiment was performed in duplicate in B lymphocytes that were isolated from two individual donors and incubated for up to 3 days after infection with adenovirus expressing HCV core protein to identify dynamic gene expression patterns. Differential expression of representative genes was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that HCV core significantly inhibited B-lymphocyte apoptosis. We showed a dramatic downregulation of MHC class II molecules in B cells expressing HCV core, whereas the expression of immunoglobulin genes was not significantly altered. Moreover, genes associated with leukemia and B-lymphoma were consistently upregulated by HCV core. In contrast, downregulation of caspase-1 and caspase-4 was found to be associated with core's ability to prevent B-lymphocyte apoptosis. In summary, we have identified several clusters of genes that are differentially expressed in human B lymphocytes expressing HCV core, suggesting a potential impairment of antigen processing and presentation, which may provide more insights into HCV infection in B lymphocytes.","['Wu, Chuan-ging', 'Budhu, Anuradha', 'Chen, Sheng', 'Zhou, Xiaoling', 'Popescu, Nicholas C', 'Valerie, Kristoffer', 'Wang, Xin Wei']","['Wu CG', 'Budhu A', 'Chen S', 'Zhou X', 'Popescu NC', 'Valerie K', 'Wang XW']","['Division of Hematology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA. wu@cber.fda.gov']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (nucleocapsid protein, Hepatitis C virus)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism/*virology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepacivirus/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Viral Core Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2119/2006-00020.Wu [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 2006 Jan-Mar;12(1-3):47-53. doi: 10.2119/2006-00020.Wu.,,,,,PMC1514550,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine the optimal threshold, in terms of residual leukemic cells, and the time point of choice, that is, post-induction (post-Ind) or post-consolidation (post-Cons), able to better predict outcome. By applying the maximally selected log-rank statistics, the threshold discriminating MRD- from MRD+ cases was set at 3.5 x 10(-4) residual leukemic cells, a level that allowed the identification of distinct subgroups of patients, both at post-Ind and post-Cons time points. Post-Cons MRD- patients had a superior outcome in terms of relapse rate, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P<0.001, for all comparisons), regardless of the MRD status after induction. In particular, patients entering MRD negativity only after consolidation showed the same outcome as those achieving early negativity after induction. Multivariate analysis, including karyotype, age, MDR1 phenotype, post-Ind and post-Cons MRD levels, indicated that the post-Cons MRD status independently affected relapse rate, OS and RFS (P<0.001, for all comparisons). IN CONCLUSION: (1) the threshold of 3.5 x 10(-4) is valid in discriminating risk categories in adult AML and (2) post-Cons MRD assessment is critical to predict disease outcome.","['Buccisano, F', 'Maurillo, L', 'Gattei, V', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Cox, M C', 'Panetta, P', 'Consalvo, M Irno', 'Mazzone, C', 'Neri, B', 'Ottaviani, L', 'Fraboni, D', 'Tamburini, A', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Amadori, S', 'Venditti, A']","['Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Gattei V', 'Del Poeta G', 'Del Principe MI', 'Cox MC', 'Panetta P', 'Consalvo MI', 'Mazzone C', 'Neri B', 'Ottaviani L', 'Fraboni D', 'Tamburini A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Department of Biopatologia e Diagnostica per Immagini, Policlinico Tor Vergata and Ospedale S Eugenio, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*mortality/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404313 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404313 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1783-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404313.

On the other hand, imatinib has demonstrated remarkable, although transient, activity in relapsed and refractory Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), which prompted us to assess the use of imatinib in previously untreated elderly patients. ALL patients aged 55 years or older were given steroids during 1 week. Ph+ve cases were then offered a chemotherapy-based induction followed by a consolidation phase with imatinib and steroids during 2 months. Patients in complete response (CR) after consolidation were given 10 maintenance blocks of alternating chemotherapy, including two additional 2-month blocks of imatinib. Thirty patients were included in this study and are compared with 21 historical controls.

Its involvement in human leukemogenesis is demonstrated by gross perturbations in its expression in human leukemia cells, particularly in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines where increases in AHI-1 transcripts of 40-fold are seen. To test directly whether deregulated expression of AHI-1 contributes to their transformed properties, knockdown of AHI-1 expression in Hut78 cells, a cell line derived from a patient with Sezary syndrome (SS), was performed using retroviral-mediated RNA interference. Retroviral-mediated suppression specifically inhibited expression of AHI-1 and its isoforms in transduced cells by 80% and also reduced autocrine production of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) by up to 85%. It further significantly reduced their growth factor independence in vitro and the ability to produce tumors in immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, aberrant expression of AHI-1, particularly truncated isoforms, was present in CD4+CD7- Sezary cells from some patients with SS. Elevated expression of IL-2 and TNFalpha was also found in these cells. These findings provide strong evidence of the oncogenic activity of AHI-1 in human leukemogenesis and demonstrate that its deregulation may contribute to the development of SS.","['Ringrose, A', 'Zhou, Y', 'Pang, E', 'Zhou, L', 'Lin, A E-J', 'Sheng, G', 'Li, X-J', 'Weng, A', 'Su, M W', 'Pittelkow, M R', 'Jiang, X']","['Ringrose A', 'Zhou Y', 'Pang E', 'Zhou L', 'Lin AE', 'Sheng G', 'Li XJ', 'Weng A', 'Su MW', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AHI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*physiology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA Interference', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sezary Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404321 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404321 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1593-601. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404321.

The viability of cells was assessed by MTT assay and the expression of MDR1 gene was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: No expression of MDR1 gene was revealed in HL60 cells, but MDR1 started to be expressed after incubation of cells with 2 nM of VCR and its expression level elevates with increase of agent concentration. MTT test has shown that HL-60/VCR cells were 75-fold more resistant to VCR and 42-fold higher resistant to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) compared to sensitive HL60 cells.

Since the expression of minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1(H) is limited to hematopoietic cells, ex vivo generated HA-1(H)-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be used for adoptive immunotherapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Numerous studies have shown that primary CTL induction from naive precursors requires professional antigen-presenting cells. Here, the feasibility of ex vivo induction of HA-1(H)-specific CD8+ CTLs is demonstrated from unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from healthy blood donors when CD4+ T-cell help is provided during primary stimulation. As a stimulus for the induction of T-cell help, tetanus toxoid (TT) was used. RESULTS: After the second restimulation cycle, approximately 1 percent of CD8+ T cells stained positively with the HLA-A*0201/HA-1(H) pentamer. Positive T cells were further expanded more than 1000-fold by antigen-independent stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies. HA-1(H)-induced T cells showed the classical phenotype for CD8+ memory effector cells: the phenotype changed from a mixed CD45RA/RO phenotype to an activated phenotype characterized by high expression of CD45RO and no expression of CCR7. The generated T cells revealed a very potent CTL response, even at low E:T ratios. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that TT provides a very potent and cost-effective tool for the in vitro induction of antigen-specific CTLs from precursor PBMNCs that can easily be adapted to GMP conditions for translational purposes.","['Eiz-Vesper, Britta', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Daubert, Claudia', 'Khattab, Barbara', 'Blasczyk, Rainer']","['Eiz-Vesper B', 'Horn PA', 'Daubert C', 'Khattab B', 'Blasczyk R']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/analysis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/immunology/*pharmacology']",2006/07/14 09:00,2006/10/14 09:00,['2006/07/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF00872 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00872.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2006 Jul;46(7):1210-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00872.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the discovery of the presence of a unique and constant chromosomal abnormality slightly more than 40 years ago, substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the biology of the disease. This progress has translated into significant improvement in the longterm prognosis of patients with this disease. This change came first with the use of stem cell transplantation and interferon alfa, but recently it has opened the era of molecularly targeted therapies. Imatinib, a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may be the best example of our attempts to identify molecular abnormalities and develop drugs directed specifically at them. Furthermore, the understanding of at least some of the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib has led to rapid development of new agents that may overcome this resistance. The outlook today for patients with CML is much brighter than just a few years ago. It is our hope that this fascinating journey in CML can be replicated in other malignancies.

However, the highly conserved functional sites known today seem insufficient to explain receptor specific recruitment of different coactivator and corepressor proteins and regulation of transcription. To search for new receptor-subtype specific functional sites, we applied difference evolutionary trace (difference ET) analysis to the ligand binding domain of steroid receptors, a subgroup of the nuclear receptor (NR) family. This computational approach identified a new functional site located on a surface opposite to currently known protein-protein interaction sites and distinct from the ligand binding pocket. Strikingly, the literature shows that in vivo variations at residues in the new site are linked to androgen resistance and leukemia, and our own targeted mutations to this site lower but do not eradicate transcriptional activation by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), with reduced ligand binding affinity and SRC-1 interaction. Thus, these data demonstrate that this evolutionary important surface can function as an allosteric site that modulates some but not all receptor binding interactions. Evolutionary analysis further shows that this allosteric regulatory site is shared among all NRs from groups 2 (HNF4-like) and 4 (NGFIB-like), suggesting a role among many nuclear receptors. Its concave structure, hydrophobic composition, and residue variability among nuclear receptors further suggest that it would be amenable for specific drug design. This highlights the power of evolutionary information for the identification of new functional sites even in a protein family as well studied as NRs.","['Raviscioni, Michele', 'He, Qiang', 'Salicru, Eleni M', 'Smith, Carolyn L', 'Lichtarge, Olivier']","['Raviscioni M', 'He Q', 'Salicru EM', 'Smith CL', 'Lichtarge O']","['W.

Earlier reports have suggested that Hispanics may have an increased incidence of acute promyelocytic leukemia, but no systematic analysis of national data has yet been reported. We performed a retrospective cohort study, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute from 1992-2001 in order to compare leukemia incidence rates as a function of race and ethnicity. We identified 709 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia and analyzed incidence rates by race and sex. Hispanics were not found to have greater lifetime incidence rates than whites, with an incidence relative rate (IRR) of 0.86 that of whites (P=0.17). The age distribution among Hispanics was significantly different from non-Hispanic whites, with greater incidence rates for children ages 1-19 years (IRR=1.9, P=0.02) and adult ages 20-44 years (IRR=1.6, P=0.004). Blacks had lower lifetime incidence rates than non-Hispanic whites (IRR=0.75, P=0.04), Hispanics (IRR=0.64, P=0.007), and Asians (IRR=0.67, P=0.03). Asians did not differ from non-Hispanic whites in lifetime or age-specific incidence rates.

Recently, we demonstrated that the proto-oncogene TCL1, overexpressed in human T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, is an Akt kinase co-activator. Tightly restricted TCL1 gene expression in early developmental cells suggested that the TCL1 gene is regulated at a transcriptional level. To characterize how TCL1 gene expression is regulated, we cloned the 5'-promoter of the TCL1 gene located at human chromosome 14q32. The 5'-TCL1 promoter region contains a TATA box with cis-regulatory elements for Nur77/NGFI-B (nerve growth factor-responsive element (NBRE), CCAAGGTCA), NFkappaB, and fork head transcription factor. Nur77/NGFI-B, an orphan receptor superfamily transcription factor implicated in T-cell apoptosis, is a substrate for Akt. We hypothesized that TCL1 transactivity is regulated through Akt-induced phosphorylation of Nur77/NGFI-B in vivo. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with chromosomal immunoprecipitation assays, wild-type Nur77, but not S350A mutant Nur77, could specifically bind to TCL1-NBRE. A luciferase assay demonstrated that TCL1-NBRE is required for inhibition of TCL1 transactivity upon nerve growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor stimulation, which activates Akt and phosphorylates Nur77. Using a chromosomal immunoprecipitation assay with reverse transcription-PCR, nerve growth factor stimulation inhibited binding of endogenous Nur77 to TCL1-NBRE, in turn, suppressing TCL1 gene expression. The results together establish that TCL1-NBRE is a novel negative regulatory element of Nur77 (NGFI-B). To the best of our knowledge, TCL1-NBRE is the first direct target of Nur77 involving the regulation of intracellular cell death survival. This Akt-induced inhibitory mechanism of TCL1 should play an important role in immunological and/or neuronal development in vivo.","['Hiromura, Makoto', 'Suizu, Futoshi', 'Narita, Masumi', 'Kinowaki, Keiichi', 'Noguchi, Masayuki']","['Hiromura M', 'Suizu F', 'Narita M', 'Kinowaki K', 'Noguchi M']","['Division of Cancer Biology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0815, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nr4a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nr4a1 protein, rat)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Response Elements/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)58060-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M602420200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Sep 22;281(38):27753-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M602420200.

Chk2 is essential for p53 transcriptional and apoptotic activities. Although mutations of p53 are present in more than half of all tumors, mutations of Chk2 in cancers are rare, suggesting that Chk2 may be inactivated by unknown alternative mechanisms. Here we elucidate one such alternative mechanism regulated by PML (promyelocytic leukemia) that is involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although p53-inactivating mutations are extremely rare in APL, t(15;17) chromosomal translocation which fuses retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha) to PML is almost always present in APL, while the other PML allele is intact. We demonstrate that PML interacts with Chk2 and activates Chk2 by mediating its autophosphorylation step, an essential step for Chk2 activity that occurs after phosphorylation by the upstream kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated). PML/RARalpha in APL suppresses Chk2 by dominantly inhibiting the auto-phosphorylation step, but inactivation of PML/RARalpha with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) restores Chk2 autophosphorylation and activity. Thus, by fusing PML with RARalpha, the APL cells appear to have achieved functional suppression of Chk2 compromising the Chk2-p53 apoptotic pathway.","['Yang, Shutong', 'Jeong, Jae-Hoon', 'Brown, Alexandra L', 'Lee, Chang-Hun', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Chung, Jay H', 'Kim, Myung K']","['Yang S', 'Jeong JH', 'Brown AL', 'Lee CH', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Chung JH', 'Kim MK']","['Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/12/19 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)35195-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M604391200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Sep 8;281(36):26645-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M604391200.

METHODS: In a series of 271 consecutive patients with TA (219 biopsy-proven), we retrospectively analyzed the frequency and type of malignancy concurrent with vasculitis (less than 1 year before or after), as well as the main features and outcome of TA in this setting. We also surveyed all cases published in the French-British literature. RESULTS: We observed 20 patients with TA and concurrent malignancy and reviewed 27 similar published reports. GCA was documented pathologically in 86% of the cases. The time between diagnosis of TA and that of malignancy averaged 3.5 months (synchronous diagnoses in 27 patients). Various locations of cancers were found, particularly the gastrointestinal tract (9 cases); blood malignancies accounted for 45% of cases (lymphoid disorder in 9, myelodysplastic syndrome in 11, chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1). In our patients, logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate differences between those with and without malignancy, except for a higher frequency of rheumatic involvement in the former group (60% vs 30%; p = 0.01). The initial response to steroid treatment was good in 92% of 40 assessable patients, and the vasculitis course mirrored that of malignancy in only 2 patients. Regarding the outcome of TA, no differences were observed in our patients with and without malignancy. CONCLUSION: Concurrent malignancy in TA is not a rare finding, being observed in up to 7.4% of the cases.

Bortezomib induces apoptosis in vitro in CLL cells, both alone and in combination, including in cells resistant to fludarabine or other agents. The aim of the current randomized, open-label, Phase II study was to investigate the clinical activity of bortezomib in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL. Twenty-two patients with histologically confirmed B-cell CLL were treated with bortezomib at doses of 1.0 mg/m2, 1.3 mg/m2, or 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle for a maximum of 9 cycles. None of 19 patients evaluable for response achieved complete remission or partial response; however, signs of biologic activity based on disease site responses (e.g., reduction in lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) were observed. In the 1.5 mg/m2 dose group, a higher proportion of patients had stable disease, and a lower proportion had progressive disease compared with the 2 lower-dose groups. Eleven patients, all in the 2 higher dose groups, experienced Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]); 2 patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 hematologic AEs included anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia; Grade 3 nervous system AEs included aphasia; peripheral neuropathy, not otherwise specified; and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Although no objective responses were achieved in patients with fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL, single-agent bortezomib demonstrated biologic activity. In view of the evidence for its activity, further exploration of bortezomib in combination with other agents is warranted.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Gribben, John', 'Byrd, John C', 'Flinn, Ian W', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Sheng, Shihong', 'Esseltine, Dixie-Lee', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Faderl S', 'Rai K', 'Gribben J', 'Byrd JC', 'Flinn IW', ""O'Brien S"", 'Sheng S', 'Esseltine DL', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Although its potential pathophysiologic role in solid tumors has been extensively studied for more than 3 decades, enhancement of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other malignant hematological disorders has been recognized more recently. An increased level of angiogenesis has been documented by various experimental methods both in bone marrow and lymph nodes of patients with CLL. Although the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of this disease remains to be fully elucidated, experimental data suggest that several angiogenic factors play a role in the disease progression. Biologic markers of angiogenesis were also shown to be of prognostic relevance in CLL. The current findings provide the rationale for investigating antiangiogenic agents in CLL.

There were even reports about 700 deaths due to thyroid carcinoma in Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus, resulting from the accident. In this review we discussed the incidence of thyroid cancer in different parts of the world, especially in heavily contaminated countries, as Ukraine and Belarus, and the possible link between radioisotope activity in the thyroid and the development of malignancy. The study carried out in Minsk showed 40-fold increase of the incidence of thyroid cancer in the years 1986-1994, in comparison to the period 1977-1985. An increase of the incidence of thyroid cancer has generally been observed in many countries after the Chernobyl accident. We focused on the factors that may have an influence on this phenomenon, especially diagnostic tests, health care, social and environmental factors, like iodine level in water and soil. The results of molecular biology studies, e.g. RET translocation in carcinoma type RET/PTC1 in elderly and RET/PTC3 in children, and expression Ax1 and Gas6 in children were reviewed as well. We also mentioned other thyroid diseases, like nodular goitre, cysts, the disturbance of thyroid function and autoimmunity, possibly linked to the radiation after Chernobyl accident. Data obtained from the regions near Chernobyl showed no increased risk of other types of malignancy (leukaemia, Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's lymphoma) in 1986-1996.

The goal of this phase II study by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of a new salvage regimen (FLAM) consisting of sequential fludarabine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone. Fifty patients were included with primary (n = 13) or secondary (n = 5) refractoriness, early (<12 months) first relapse (n = 15), first relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) regardless CR duration (n = 13), and second or subsequent relapse (n = 4). Median age was 31(18-60) years, 28% of patients were bcr/abl-positive. CR rate equaled 50% and was significantly higher for patients in whom FLAM was administered as a second-line therapy compared to those more heavily pre-treated (66 vs 13%, p = 0.02). Seventeen patients had leukemia regrowth after initial cytoreduction, whereas, eight patients died in aplasia. The incidence of early death was higher in patients aged > or =40 years compared to the younger subgroup (33 vs 8%, p=0.03). Septic infections were the most frequent severe complication. At 3 years, the probability of disease-free survival for patients who achieved CR equaled 16%. Seven patients underwent allogeneic HCT.

Another oncogenic transcription factor, AML1-ETO, was proposed to cause an HDAC-dependent repression of RAR target genes. The RAR target RARbeta2 gene has been reported to be frequently silenced by hypermethylation in many types of cancer cells. We examined the methylation status of the RARbeta2 and asked if demethylation could reverse ATRA resistance in ATRA-resistant PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO-positive cells. PML-RARalpha positive NB4 and its ATRA-resistant subvariant MR2 and AML1-ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cells had heterozygous methylation of RARbeta2. Although DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially reversed RARbeta2 CpG methylation in these cells, it did not significantly enhance ATRA-induced RARbeta2 mRNA expression and induction of maturation. However, the histone acetylase inhibitor SAHA combined with ATRA significantly reactivated RARbeta2 mRNA both in NB4 and MR2 cells with degradation of PML-RARalpha, which was associated with maturation. In contrast, SAHA did not affect AML1-ETO levels and failed to induce RARbeta2 expression and maturation in Kasumi-1 cells. In primary AML samples, RARbeta2 expression was uniformly low; however, no specific correlation was observed between the methylation of the RARbeta2 gene and expression of the fusion proteins, PML-RARalpha, and AML1-ETO. These results demonstrate that oncogenic PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO translocations are rarely associated with RARbeta2 promoter methylation in primary AML samples.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'Jin, Linhua', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii, Yuko', 'Miyake, Kazunori', 'Miyake, Noriko', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Nagaoka, Isao', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Tabe Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Kondo Y', 'Contractor R', 'Jin L', 'Ruvolo V', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii Y', 'Miyake K', 'Miyake N', 'Ohsaka A', 'Nagaoka I', 'Issa JP', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 448, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2006/07/13 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2005/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-006-0148-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2006 Oct;85(10):689-704. doi: 10.1007/s00277-006-0148-7.

However, the use of this agent as a front-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 95 newly diagnosed APL patients, 85 patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were sequentially evaluated during a 4-60 month period by conventional RT-PCR. A total of 30 patients (six relapsed and 24 in continued CR) were selected and monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) assay. The PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts values were normalised to every 10(6) copies of G6PDH transcripts (NQ). RESULTS: RQ-PCR analyses showed a rapid rate of clearance of NQ levels during the courses of arsenic therapy. In the majority of patients in CR, the NQ levels were below 5 x 10(2) in peripheral blood (PB) samples. In all the relapsed cases with follow-up intervals of 1-6 months (median 3 months) clinical relapse was predictable by increasing NQ level above this threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the usefulness of PB and the definition of threshold level for early prediction of relapse. The threshold level correlates well with risk of relapse; therefore, transcript ratio below the level should be regarded as a goal in the clinical management of this disease.","['Ghaffari, S H', 'Rostami, S', 'Bashash, D', 'Alimoghaddam, K', 'Ghavamzadeh, A']","['Ghaffari SH', 'Rostami S', 'Bashash D', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Hematology, Oncology and BMT Research Center, Tehran University Medical Sciences, Shariaty Hospital, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari2000@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/metabolism', 'Child', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/metabolism', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2006/07/13 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)47320-1 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdl150 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2006 Oct;17(10):1553-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdl150.

We examined whether IgE also could facilitate transepithelial antigen sampling. METHODS: Stool samples from food-allergic patients undergoing oral food challenge were analyzed for CD23 and food-specific IgE. CD23 isoform expression on primary human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The role of CD23 isoforms in transcytosis of antigen and IgE-antigen complexes was assessed using polarized human T84 cells retrovirally transfected with CD23a or CD23b. RESULTS: CD23 was expressed constitutively on IECs, and food-allergic patients had increased levels of soluble CD23 and food-specific IgE in the stool after challenge. CD23a, but not CD23b, was expressed by primary human IECs. We show in transcytosis assays that CD23a, but not CD23b, acts as a bidirectional transporter of IgE. In addition, specific IgE facilitated the uptake of antigen from the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer by diverting antigen from delivery to lysosomes. Finally, delivery of antigen-IgE complexes across the epithelial barrier could induce the degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells transfected with the human high-affinity IgE receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that CD23a is expressed normally on human IECs, and in the presence of IgE can function as an antigen-sampling mechanism capable of activating subepithelial mast cells. IgE may serve as a secretory immunoglobulin that in concert with CD23 participates in food-induced pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract.","['Li, Hongxing', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna', 'Charlop-Powers, Zachary', 'Shreffler, Wayne', 'Chehade, Mirna', 'Thomas, Sunil', 'Roda, Giulia', 'Dahan, Stephanie', 'Sperber, Kirk', 'Berin, M Cecilia']","['Li H', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn A', 'Charlop-Powers Z', 'Shreffler W', 'Chehade M', 'Thomas S', 'Roda G', 'Dahan S', 'Sperber K', 'Berin MC']","['Department of Medicine/Division of Clinical Immunology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",,['eng'],"['AI-45343/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-071576/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epithelial Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Food Hypersensitivity/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Absorption/*immunology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5085(06)00711-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2006 Jul;131(1):47-58. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated protective effects of these two triterpenoic acids against H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage in leukemic L1210, K562 and HL-60 cells using single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE). We compared their protective effects (antioxidant activities) with respect to the different position of the methyl group in their chemical structures. After 24h pre-treatment of cells both compounds investigated inhibited significantly the incidence of DNA single strand breaks induced by H(2)O(2). The concentration range of UA and OA was in all experiments 2.5-10 micromol/l. The antioxidant activity of OA determined by SCGE was significantly higher compared to UA in L1210 ((+)P<0.05) and K562 cells ((+++)P<0.001). Significant difference of the antioxidant activities of the two compounds was evidently connected with the different position of the methyl group. The protective effect of OA was in HL-60 cells slightly lower compared to the activity of UA, but the difference between the protective effects of UA and OA was not significant. In conclusion we can say that both natural pentacyclic triterpenoic acids investigated, UA and OA, manifested potent antioxidant effects. The different position of one methyl group in their chemical structures caused moderately different biological activities of these compounds on three leukemic cell lines. To explore their mechanisms of action further investigation seems to be therefore worthwhile.","['Ovesna, Zdenka', 'Kozics, Katarina', 'Slamenova, Darina']","['Ovesna Z', 'Kozics K', 'Slamenova D']","['Department of Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis, Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. zdenka.ovesna@savba.sk <zdenka.ovesna@savba.sk>']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oleanolic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(06)00166-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Aug 30;600(1-2):131-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.03.008.

The IC50 values obtained for K562 cells post-72 h of BPC were less than 5.0 microM by using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and trypan blue assays. Using the Acridine Orange vital staining combining fluorescence microscopy it was observed that the complex triggers apoptosis in K562 cells, inducing DNA fragmentation, as analysed through electrophoresis. Lysosomal-membrane permeabilization was also observed in K562 cells post-5 h of BPC, which suggests intralysosomal accumulation by proton-trapping, since its pKa value ranged from 5.1 to 6.5. Caspase-3, and -6 activity induced by BPC in K562 cells was prevented by the cathepsin-B inhibitor [N-(L-3-trans-propylcarbamoyl-oxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-isoleucyl-L-proline] (CA074). These events occurred in the presence of endogenous bcl-2 and bax expression. Acute toxicological studies demonstrated that BPC produces no lesions for liver and kidney fourteen-days after drug administration (100 mg/kg--i.p.). White and red blood cells of BPC-treated mice presented normal morphological characteristics. Taken together, these data suggest a novel lysosomal pathway for BPC-induced apoptosis, in which lysosomes are the primary target and cathepsin B acts as death mediator.","['Barbosa, Christiano M V', 'Oliveira, Carlos R', 'Nascimento, Fabio D', 'Smith, Mickaela C M', 'Fausto, Daniela M', 'Soufen, Marco Antonio', 'Sena, Eliana', 'Araujo, Ronaldo C', 'Tersariol, Ivarne L S', 'Bincoletto, Claudia', 'Caires, Antonio C F']","['Barbosa CM', 'Oliveira CR', 'Nascimento FD', 'Smith MC', 'Fausto DM', 'Soufen MA', 'Sena E', 'Araujo RC', 'Tersariol IL', 'Bincoletto C', 'Caires AC']","['Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Bioquimica, Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi das Cruzes, SP, Brazil.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (2-sulfonato-1,1-ethylidene bisphosphonic acid)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 6/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphosphonates', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Organophosphonates/chemistry', 'Palladium/chemistry', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(06)00619-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2006 Aug 7;542(1-3):37-47. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.06.004.

The percentage, phenotypic profile and clonality pattern of bone marrow lymphoid infiltrate were analysed before and after RTX treatment. Clinical, histological and molecular responses to RTX were correlated to the clinical outcome of the patients. Sixteen out of twenty-six patients obtained a complete clinical remission (CR). A favourable histology--follicular lymphoma (FL), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)--was associated with a higher frequency of clinical CR and histological remission (HR), in comparison with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). Two patterns of bone marrow HR were observed: 1) complete lymphoid cell disappearance (9 patients); or 2) nodular/interstitial T-cell infiltration (10 patients). Three histological persistence (HP) patterns were observed: 1) persistence of CD20+ small lymphoid cells in 1 patient with MCL; 2) loss of CD20 antigen expression in 4 patients with CLL; or 3) persistence only of clusters of monotypic plasma cells in 2 patients with LPL. CR and HR were strongly correlated. The percentage of lymphomatous infiltrate after RTX was higher in patients who subsequently died of the disease. Molecular response showed no correlations with the further clinical course in 12 patients achieving a complete clinical remission. In conclusion, bone marrow morphological and immunohistochemical analysis with a restricted panel of antibodies is useful to avoid 42% false positive and 85% false negative interpretations. Persistence of monoclonality after RTX might have a role in evaluating the molecular pattern of CD20-negative clones that can emerge after RTX as a tumoral escape to therapy.","['Goteri, G', 'Olivieri, A', 'Ranaldi, R', 'Lucesole, M', 'Filosa, A', 'Capretti, R', 'Pieramici, T', 'Leoni, P', 'Rubini, C', 'Fabris, G', 'Lo Muzio, L']","['Goteri G', 'Olivieri A', 'Ranaldi R', 'Lucesole M', 'Filosa A', 'Capretti R', 'Pieramici T', 'Leoni P', 'Rubini C', 'Fabris G', 'Lo Muzio L']","['Institute of Pathology, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ospedali Riuniti Umberto I - G.M.

METHODS: Total cellular proteins extracted from a RA sensitive cell line NB4 and a RA resistant cell line MR2 were separated by two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). High quality 2D-PAGE protein profiles were obtained and analyzed by PDQuest v7.1 analysis software to screen differentially expressed protein spots. Those sports were identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 2-DE patterns of APL cell lines with high-resolution and reproducibility were obtained. The average spots for MR2 and NB4 cells were 890+/-45 and 912+/-56, respectively. 57 significantly differentially expressed protein spots were screened, among which 23 protein spots were identified to be up-regulated and 34 down-regulated in MR2 cells compared with NB4 cells. Ten proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, with a successful identification rate of 70%. The identified proteins could be classified into different categories: oncogenes,cell cycle regulator and signal transducer. CONCLUSION: The utilization of 2D-PAGE is effective in identifying the protein expression profiles between RA resistant and sensitive APL cells, therefore this study may provide a novel clue to elucidate the drug resistant mechanisms of all-trans retinoic acid.","['Qin, Hui', 'Liu, Ting', 'Yang, Jin-Liang', 'Huang, Xin', 'Liu, Bin', 'Song, Xin', 'Zhao, Xia', 'Wei, Yu-Quan']","['Qin H', 'Liu T', 'Yang JL', 'Huang X', 'Liu B', 'Song X', 'Zhao X', 'Wei YQ']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.

16831266,NLM,MEDLINE,20090528,20150313,,25,7,2006 Jul,[Effect and possible mechanism of HnRNP E2 decoy RNA on proliferation of K562 leukemia cells].,793-7,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The abnormal expression of poly(rC)-binding protein E2 (hnRNP E2) induced by BCR/ABL plays an important role in blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The present study was to investigate the effect of hnRNP E2 decoy RNA on the cell proliferation in K562 leukemia cells, and further elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Decoy hnRNP E2 plasmid was constructed and transfected into K562 cells using cationic liposome. Stably transfected cells were selected with G418. The cell proliferation rate was determined by cell growth curve using trypan blue staining, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and c-Myc gene expression were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: The proliferation rate of stably transfected K562 cells was inhibited by (62.73+/-12.92)%. The cell cycle was arrested at S phase [stably transfected K562 cell group: (55.59+/-4.67)%, control group: (44.70+/-4.21)%, P<0.05]; C/EBPalpha mRNA level remained unchanged. However the 42 ku-C/EBPalpha protein expression was elevated by (49.72+/-5.58)%; c-Myc mRNA and protein expression was inhibited by (58.27+/-7.23)% and (57.26+/-6.52)%, respectively. CONCLUSION: HnRNP E2 decoy RNA could inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells, and this may be caused by the blockage of the binding between hnRNP E2 and C/EBPalpha mRNA and subsequent elevation of 42 ku-C/EBPalpha by decoy RNA.","['Chen, Xin-Min', 'Feng, Wen-Li', 'Zhao, Shi-Qiao', 'Zeng, Jian-Ming', 'Bai, Wei-Jun', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong', 'Huang, Zong-Gan']","['Chen XM', 'Feng WL', 'Zhao SQ', 'Zeng JM', 'Bai WJ', 'Wang XZ', 'Huang ZG']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics of Education Ministry, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing, 400016, P.

No practical assay is currently available for routine use in a clinical laboratory. OBJECTIVE: We report the development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction melting curve analysis assay that is appropriate for molecular diagnostics testing. DESIGN: Specific primers and fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes were designed, and patients with a previously diagnosed myeloproliferative disorder, de novo acute myeloid leukemia, or reactive condition were selected. The DNA was extracted from fresh and archived peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens, and real-time polymerase chain reaction melting curve analysis was performed on the LightCycler platform (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind). RESULTS: The JAK2 region was successfully amplified, and wild-type amplicons were reproducibly discriminated from JAK2(V617F) amplicons. Titration studies using homozygous wild-type and mutant cell lines showed the relative areas under a melting curve were proportional to allele proportion, and the assay reliably detected one mutant in 20 total cells. JAK2(V617F) was identified in patients previously diagnosed with a myeloproliferative disorder or acute myeloid leukemia transformed from myeloproliferative disorder, whereas a wild-type genotype was identified in patients with reactive conditions or de novo acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the suitability of this assay for identifying JAK2(V617F) in a clinical laboratory setting. Furthermore, the semiquantitative detection of JAK2(V617F) in archived specimens provides a new tool for studying the prognostic significance of this mutation.","['Olsen, Randall J', 'Tang, Zhouwen', 'Farkas, Daniel H', 'Bernard, David W', 'Zu, Youli', 'Chang, Chung-Che']","['Olsen RJ', 'Tang Z', 'Farkas DH', 'Bernard DW', 'Zu Y', 'Chang CC']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/blood/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transition Temperature']",2006/07/13 09:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['OA60056 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-997-DOTJMI [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Jul;130(7):997-1003. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-997-DOTJMI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In phase III trials in patients with indolent or aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), intravenous rituximab in combination with chemotherapy was more effective as first- or second-line therapy than chemotherapy alone in terms of tumor remission and patient survival. Likewise, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), rituximab in combination with chemotherapy appeared more effective than chemotherapy alone as either first- or second-line treatment. In addition, rituximab maintenance therapy was shown to significantly prolong tumor remission and patient survival in patients with indolent B-cell NHL or CLL. The combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) was cost effective as first-line therapy for advanced-stage diffuse large B-cell NHL compared with CHOP alone. Rituximab, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, was generally well tolerated in patients with NHL or CLL. Overall, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, is a valuable option for first- and second-line therapy in patients with advanced-stage indolent or aggressive B-cell NHL, and possibly those with B-cell CLL, and is included in current treatment guidelines for these indications.

In RIT, a radionuclide is coupled to a monoclonal antibody, directed against an antigen expressed on tumor cells. Recently, RIT has been introduced targeting the CD20 surface antigen, which is expressed on nearly all B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Clinical experience with RIT in the treatment of patients with indolent NHL is increasing. To date, two commercially available agents are used: yttrium-90 ((90)Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan and iodine-131 ((131)I)-tositumomab. In general, there is no organ-specific non-hematologic toxicity when a standard dose of RIT is used. Bone marrow suppression is the dose-limiting RIT toxicity; therefore, bone marrow infiltration by NHL should be investigated before treatment. Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia after RIT are being investigated but long-term data are needed for final evaluation. Results are quite encouraging with respect to complete remission and overall response, even in pretreated patients with unconjugated monoclonal antibodies. RIT induces high response rates and a significant subgroup of patients has achieved long-term durable responses. RIT is feasible in heavily pretreated patients and does not compromise future treatments in the event of progressive disease. Randomized phase III studies are in progress to evaluate the timing of RIT in the overall management of indolent NHLInvestigations of new emerging therapeutic strategies for patients with indolent NHL are underway, with research into the feasibility of RIT as first-line therapy and in advanced disease, RIT dose escalation and combined modality approaches with autologous stem cell transplantation. The encouraging results of RIT in indolent NHL have initiated studies focusing on its benefit for patients with aggressive NHL.","['Visser, Otto J', 'Perk, Lars R', 'Zijlstra, Josee M', 'van Dongen, Guus A M S', 'Huijgens, Peter C', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Visser OJ', 'Perk LR', 'Zijlstra JM', 'van Dongen GA', 'Huijgens PC', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. o.visser@vumc.nl']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/13 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2041 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200620040-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2006;20(4):201-7. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200620040-00001.,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: 1) high expression was observed for HLA I and II class, moderate for CD40, CD83, CD86 and low or no expression for CD80, CD54, CD1a, CD11c and CD123; 2) we found expression of mRNA for IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-beta in blasts cells (but not in all specimens). We noted relatively lower expression of all assessed cytokines comparing to T-cells obtained from healthy donors but interestingly expression for IL-10 was higher in normal B-cells than in blast cells, and IFN-gamma and IL-4 were not found in normal B-cells. In summary we suggest that ALL-blasts present low expression of costimulatory/adhesion molecules and mRNA for cytokines and this probably contribute to the absence of host T- cells stimulation to immune response.","['Luczynski, W', 'Stasiak-Barmuta, A', 'Ilendo, E', 'Kovalchuk, O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M', 'Malinowska, I', 'Mitura-Lesiuk, M', 'Chyczewski, L', 'Matysiak, M', 'Kowalczyk, J', 'Jaworowski, R']","['Luczynski W', 'Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Ilendo E', 'Kovalchuk O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Malinowska I', 'Mitura-Lesiuk M', 'Chyczewski L', 'Matysiak M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Jaworowski R']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2006;53(4):301-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among targeted cancer therapeutics, biologicals with targetable antibodies or ligands conjugated or fused to toxins or chemicals for direct cell-killing ability have been developed over the last 2 decades. These conjugated or fused chimeric proteins are termed immunotoxins or cytotoxic agents. Two agents, DAB389IL-2 (ONTAKTM) targeting the interleukin-2 receptor and CD33-calicheamicin (Mylotarg), have been approved by the FDA for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. Such targetable agents, including RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22), IL13-PE38QQR, and Tf-CRM107, are being tested in clinical trials. Several agents using unique technology such as a cleavable adapter or immunoliposomes with antibodies are also in the preclinical stage.

We report the high-resolution X-ray structures of WDR5 in the unliganded form and complexed with histone H3 peptides having unmodified and mono-, di- and trimethylated K4, which together provide the first comprehensive analysis of methylated histone recognition by the ubiquitous WD40-repeat fold.

However, the role these important cell populations play in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis or adult T cell leukemia remains unresolved. To better understand how HTLV-1 infection of these important cell populations may potentially impact disease progression, the regulation of HTLV-1 viral gene expression in established monocytic cell lines was examined. U-937 promonocytic cells transiently transfected with a HTLV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) luciferase construct were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce cellular differentiation. PMA-induced cellular differentiation resulted in activation of basal and Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that PMA-induced cellular differentiation induced DNA-binding activity of cellular transcription factors to Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1) repeat II. Supershift analyses revealed that factors belonging to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of basic region/leucine zipper proteins (Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, and JunD) were induced to bind to TRE-1 repeat II during cellular differentiation. Inhibition of AP-1 DNA-binding activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative c-Fos mutant (A-Fos) in transient expression analyses resulted in severely decreased levels of HTLV-1 LTR activation in PMA-induced U-937 cells. These results have suggested that following infection of peripheral blood monocytes, HTLV-1 viral gene expression may become up-regulated by AP-1 during differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells.","['Grant, Christian', 'Jain, Pooja', 'Nonnemacher, Michael', 'Flaig, Katherine E', 'Irish, Bryan', 'Ahuja, Jaya', 'Alexaki, Aikaterini', 'Alefantis, Timothy', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Grant C', 'Jain P', 'Nonnemacher M', 'Flaig KE', 'Irish B', 'Ahuja J', 'Alexaki A', 'Alefantis T', 'Wigdahl B']","['Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],['CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '56937-68-9 (phorbolol myristate acetate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Genes, fos/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*virology', 'Protein Binding', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1205723 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1205723 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Sep;80(3):640-50. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1205723.

Immunophenotypic studies showed myeloid blasts, without maturity marker, CD 117 negative and CD203 cytoplasmic positive, the latter known to be highly representative of the basophilic lineage.

Siglec-9 was absent from normal bone marrow myeloid progenitors but present on monocytic precursors. Using primary AML cells or transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, Siglec-9 mediated rapid endocytosis of anti-Siglec-9 mAb. In contrast to CD33 and Siglec-5, levels of soluble Siglec-9 were low or undetectable in bone marrow plasma from AML patients and serum from normal donors.

Atiprimod further induced apoptosis by cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. In summary, our data suggest that atiprimod has a significant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on AML cells. This effect may be facilitated by inhibition of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway. Further evaluation of atiprimod in clinical trials of AML should be considered.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Harris, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '123018-47-3 (azaspirane)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/prevention & control', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00212-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.05.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Jan;31(1):91-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.05.027.

PLZF is known to be a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. We used PLZF as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a cDNA library from the human ovary tissue. A novel cervical cancer suppressor 3 (CCS-3) was identified as a PLZF interacting partner. Further characterization revealed the BTB domain as an interacting domain of PLZF. Interaction of CCS-3 with PLZF in mammalian cells was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays. It was found that, although CCS-3 shares similar homology with eEF1A, the study determined CCS-3 to be an isoform. CCS-3 was observed to be downregulated in human cervical cell lines as well as in cervical tumors when compared to those from normal tissues. Overexpression of CCS-3 in human cervical cell lines inhibits cell growth by inducing apoptosis and suppressing human cyclin A2 promoter activity. These combined results suggest that the potential tumor suppressor activity of CCS-3 may be mediated by its interaction with PLZF.","['Rho, Seung Bae', 'Park, Young Gyo', 'Park, Kyoungsook', 'Lee, Seung-Hoon', 'Lee, Je-Ho']","['Rho SB', 'Park YG', 'Park K', 'Lee SH', 'Lee JH']","['Molecular Therapy Research Center, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center Annex 8F, 50 Ilwon-Dong, Kangnam-Ku, Seoul 135-710, South Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (CCNA2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A2)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EEF1A1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cyclin A/genetics', 'Cyclin A2', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/29 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(06)00766-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.06.047 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2006 Jul 24;580(17):4073-80. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2006.06.047.

Both TP-4 and TP-6 provided significant cytotoxicity to L1210 mouse leukemia cells. Only TP-6, a procyanidin-rich fraction, significantly reduced viability in HepG2 human liver cancer cells, yet unlike resveratrol, caused no cytotoxicity to non-cancerous PK15 pig kidney cells.

Our results show that ascorbate enhances menadione redox cycling, leading to the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (as shown by dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation). The incubation of cells in the presence of both ascorbate/menadione and aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor, resulted in a strong decrease of cell survival, reinforcing the role of H(2)O(2) as the main oxidizing agent killing K562 cells. This cell death was not caspase-3-dependent. Indeed, neither procaspase-3 and PARP were processed and only a weak cytochrome c release was observed. Moreover, we observed only 23% of cells with depolarized mitochondria. In ascorbate/menadione-treated cells, DNA fragmentation was observed without any sign of chromatin condensation (DAPI and TUNEL tests). The cell demise by ascorbate/menadione is consistent with a necrosis-like cell death confirmed by both cytometric profile of annexin-V/propidium iodide labeled cells and by light microscopy examination. Finally, we showed that a single i.p. administration of the association of ascorbate and menadione is able to inhibit the growth of K562 cells by about 60% (in both tumour size and volume) in an immune-deficient mice model. Taken together, these results reinforced our previous claims about a potential application of the ascorbate/menadione association in cancer therapy.","['Verrax, Julien', 'Stockis, Julie', 'Tison, Aurelie', 'Taper, Henryk S', 'Calderon, Pedro Buc']","['Verrax J', 'Stockis J', 'Tison A', 'Taper HS', 'Calderon PB']","['Unite de Pharmacocinetique, Metabolisme, Nutrition et Toxicologie, Departement des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium. julien.verrax@uclouvain.be']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/27 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00327-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.05.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Sep 14;72(6):671-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.05.025.

Since the vast majority of tumoral cells are quiescent, the accumulation mostly results from deficient apoptosis rather than from acute proliferation. Although the phenomenon is relevant in vivo, B-CLL cells die rapidly in vitro as a consequence of apoptosis, suggesting a lack of essential growth factors in the culture medium. Indeed, the rate of B-CLL cell death in vitro is modulated by different cytokines, some favouring the apoptotic process, others counteracting it. Two related members of the tumour necrosis factor family, BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), already known for their crucial role in normal B-cell survival, differentiation and apoptosis, were recently shown to be expressed by B-CLL cells. These molecules are able to protect the leukaemic cells against spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis via autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. This review will focus on the role of BAFF and APRIL in the survival of tumoral cells. It will discuss the expression of these molecules by B-CLL cells, their regulation, transduction pathways and their effects on leukaemic cells. The design of reagents able to counteract the effects of these molecules seems to be a new promising therapeutic approach for B-CLL and is already currently developed in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.","['Haiat, Stephanie', 'Billard, Christian', 'Quiney, Claire', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Kolb, Jean-Pierre']","['Haiat S', 'Billard C', 'Quiney C', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Kolb JP']","['UMRS INSERM 736/University Paris 6, Centre de Recherches Biomedicales des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/blood/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2377 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02377.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2006 Jul;118(3):281-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02377.x.,86,,,,PMC1782305,,,,,,,,,

However, the dose of As2O3 required to suppress human xenographs in mice is markedly higher than that used to treat APL in humans. Paradoxically, low doses of As2O3 stimulate angiogenesis, which might be expected to promote tumor growth. Clearly, appropriate dosages of As2O3 are required to treat human patients to avoid toxicity and undesirable side effects. In the present study, we investigated As2O3 with respect to its toxicity and effects on tumor growth, angiogenesis and cell apoptosis using H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in a mouse model of HCC. As2O3 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis, and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis at doses greater than 1 mg/kg, but mice lost weight and failed to thrive at doses of 4 mg/kg and greater. In contrast, low doses (<1 mg/kg) of As2O3 promoted tumor growth, upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor angiogenesis, and had no effect on tumor cell apoptosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that As2O3 inhibited the proliferation of H22 tumor cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells, and induced their apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, suggesting that the mechanism of As2O3-mediated inhibition of tumor growth is due to direct effects of the drug on both tumor cells and endothelia. In summary, different doses of As2O3 have opposing effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis. The results demonstrate that As2O3 has a narrow window of therapeutic opportunity with respect to dosage, and that low doses of the drug as used in metronomic therapy should be used with extreme caution.","['Liu, Bing', 'Pan, Shangha', 'Dong, Xuesong', 'Qiao, Haiquan', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Krissansen, Geoffrey W', 'Sun, Xueying']","['Liu B', 'Pan S', 'Dong X', 'Qiao H', 'Jiang H', 'Krissansen GW', 'Sun X']","['The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center of Heilongjiang Province/Department of General Surgery, The First Clinical College of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Aorta/cytology/drug effects', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/blood supply/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS230 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00230.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2006 Jul;97(7):675-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00230.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth inhibition of the cell lines and primary patient cells was assessed by MTT assays and colony-forming cell assays, respectively. Drug interactions were analyzed according to the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay. The determination of apoptotic cell death was performed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: Combinations of both FTIs with imatinib displayed synergism or sensitization (potentiation) in all the cell lines tested. In primary chronic phase CML cells, additive and synergistic effects were discernible for the combination of imatinib plus L744,832 and imatinib plus LB42918, respectively. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining showed enhancement of imatinib-induced apoptosis with either drug combination, both in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells.

The compound indirubin has been shown to be the active constituent. A cell permeable derivative, indirubin-3'-monoxime, is a selective and potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk). The ability of indirubin-3'-monoxime to induce apoptosis and tumor cell death in transitional cell cancer cell lines was investigated here. The growth-inhibitory properties were evaluated by EZ4U, a cytotoxic assay; apoptosis induction was determined by immunoblotting of cleaved PARP and flow cytometry of Annexin-V/PI staining during treatment. To evaluate further the underlying molecular action of indirubin-3'-monoxime on the cell cycle, the levels of cdk-1 and survivin, a mitotic spindle checkpoint and apoptosis-regulating protein, respectively, were additionally determined by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. The results indicated that indirubin-3'-monoxime induced reversible growth arrest in all four cell lines and an increase of apoptosis in two of them. The treatment with indirubin-3'-monoxime increased the expression of survivin almost four times in the RT4 cells and more than doubled it in the RT112 and T24 cells. In the SUP cells, the expression of survivin increased more than seven-fold after 72-h incubation. No clear correlation between the low apoptosis induction rate and extent of survivin expression was found. Cdk expression was not significantly altered by indirubin-3'-monoxime. In summary, indirubin-3'-monoxime might be a promising candidate for targeted cancer therapy, however, its molecular action remains to be further evaluated.","['Perabo, Frank G E', 'Frossler, Christian', 'Landwehrs, Gregor', 'Schmidt, Doris H', 'von Rucker, Alexander', 'Wirger, Andreas', 'Muller, Stefan C']","['Perabo FG', 'Frossler C', 'Landwehrs G', 'Schmidt DH', 'von Rucker A', 'Wirger A', 'Muller SC']","['Department of Urology, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53105 Bonn, Germany. perabo@lycos.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Survivin)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oximes/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2006 May-Jun;26(3A):2129-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The flow cytometric analysis indicated that capsaicin decreased the percentage of viable HL-60 cells, via the induction of G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Capsaicin-induced G0/G1-phase arrest involved the suppression of CDK2 and the cyclin E complex, which are check-point enzymes for cells moving from G0/G1- to S-phase. Capsaicin-induced apoptosis was associated with the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ production, decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, promoted cytochrome c release and increased the activation of caspase-3. An intracellular Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA) significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced apoptosis. Capsaicin-induced apoptosis was time-and dose-dependent.

RESULTS: THE COMPARISON SARDINIA-ITALY: In 1997-2001, the age-standardized mortality rate (x1,000 person-years) among males was higher than in Italy (84.4 vs 80.8) while the reverse occurred in females (50.9 vs 52.0). Ill defined causes of death were 1.4% in males and 2.5% in females (vs corresponding estimates of 1.1% and 1.4% in Italy). Compared to Italian national data, regional age-standardized estimates were higher in Sardinia for infectious diseases (23% in males and 12% in females), respiratory diseases (22% and 14%: pneumoconiosis was more than 6 times more frequent in Sardinia than in Italy), diseases of the digestive system (26% and 9%: for liver cirrhosis, the excess was 33% in males and 9% in females; corresponding figures for liver cancer were 13% and 16%), breast cancer in females (5%). On the other hand, regional mortality rates were lower than the national rates for cardiovascular diseases (-1.3% and -7.4% in males and females respectively), all cancers considered as a whole (-9% and -7%) and lung cancer (-5% and -32%). Regional and national death rates for non Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes and for leukaemia in females were almost identical, whereas the latter rate in males was slightly higher in Sardinia than in Italy (9.4 vs 8.4 x100,000 person-years). Particularly in men, the differences in mortality rates from all causes and from cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and lung cancer among the four traditional Provinces (Cagliari, Nuoro, Oristano and Sassari) were greater than the difference between Sardinia and Italy. Remarkably enough, also death rates from lymphohaemopoietic tumours were more heterogeneous within Sardinia. RESULTS IN THE INVESTIGATED AREAS: Rates of hospital discharges in Sardinia showed a high variability, which is partly attributable to differences in the availability of both hospital beds and alternative forms of care. This heterogeneity must be taken into account in the interpretation of rates of hospital discharge. These were relatively high in some areas (Cagliari, Iglesias, Portoscuso, Tortoli) and low in others (Olbia, Porto Torres, Sassari). All the reported observed/expected ratios were based on material deprivation adjusted figures. All the estimated statistics were reported with 90% Confidence Interval. INDUSTRIAL AREAS: In 1997-2001, deaths from respiratory diseases were significantly in excess in males in Portoscuso (obs/exp 205/124.77) and in San Gavino (69/46.77). Deaths from pneumoconiosis were recorded sporadically, with the exception of Portoscuso, where the excess was impressive (obs/exp 112/30.46). SMRs for lung cancer in males ranged between 0.62 in Ottana and 1.22 in San Gavino, with statistically significant departure from expected values in Portoscuso and Sarroch (both with SMR significantly in excess in males: 1.24). In Porto Torres mortality from all causes was in significant excess in both sexes (SMRs 1.04 in males and 1.09 in females), for respiratory diseases (1.08 and 1.28), for diseases of the digestive system (1.13 and 1.21), for all cancers (1.04 and 1.09). Liver cancer deaths were also in excess in both sexes (SMRs 1.18 and 1.21). The latter finding is confirmed by incidence rates from the local cancer registry. Among industrial areas, Porto Torres was also the one with a stronger evidence of an excess of deaths from lymphohaemopoietic cancer in males (obs/exp 99/83.60) and females (73/68.20). MINING AREAS: These areas are characterized by statistically significant excesses of mortality in males, largely caused by non neoplastic respiratory conditions (obs/exp 119/86.41 in Iglesias and 156/62.55 in Arbus). In recent years, deaths from pneumoconiosis averaged 20 per year in Arbus and 10 per year in Iglesias. Lung cancer in males was also significantly in excess in both areas (obs/exp 72/56.38 in Arbus and 108/72.14 in Iglesias). There is a time trend (1981-2001) towards a decrease of mortality from respiratory conditions, which nevertheless remains largely in excess over the regional average also in the most recent period. MILITARY AREAS: Statistically significant excesses of deaths and hospital discharges for non Hodgkin lymphoma were detected in La Maddalena (mortality, 1981-2001, in males 17 observed cases vs 6.13 expected, in females 8/5.64). In Salto di Quirra in 1997-2001 deaths from myeloma (in males 5/2.3) and leukaemias were increased in both sexes (total obs/exp 20/13.3, statistically non significant). URBAN AREAS: Urban areas in Sardinia are relatively well developed with high values of socioeconomic indicators. The health profile in Cagliari and Sassari is typical of towns of the Western world. In Cagliari there is a higher mortality for colorectal, breast, cervical and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental (non occupational) pollution might explain some of the observed excesses of disease in the investigated industrial areas of Sardinia, particularly in women, less likely to be exposed to hazards in the work environment, whereas in the mining areas studied the disease pattern suggests a major role of occupational exposures. On the other hand, the causal links between disease occurrence and exposures in the screened military areas remain uncertain. The disease patterns in the cities of Sardinia are likely to be associated with lifestyle and urban pollution. Historically, southern Italian Regions have been characterized by an advantage over the rest of the country in terms of health, but during the last decade such advantage tended to vanish. Sardinia confirms this secular trend. However in the most recent years studied, overall age-standardized mortality rate in Sardinian females still remains lower than Italian average, but this is not the case for males any more. Differences in the health profile between residents in different areas of Sardinia have been found to be far greater than the difference between Sardinia as a whole and Italy. A major contribution to intraregional differences is given by the 18 investigated areas where excesses were registered for: respiratory diseases (including cancer) in the industrial areas of Portoscuso, Sarroch and Porto Torres, and in the mining areas; diseases of the digestive tract, liver cancer and lymphohaemopoietic cancer in the area of Porto Torres; cancer of the lymphohaemopoietic system in some military areas; cancers of the colon and rectum, lung, breast and uterus in some of the major cities of the Region.","['Biggeri, Annibale', 'Lagazio, Corrado', 'Catelan, Dolores', 'Pirastu, Roberta', 'Casson, Felice', 'Terracini, Benedetto']","['Biggeri A', 'Lagazio C', 'Catelan D', 'Pirastu R', 'Casson F', 'Terracini B']","['Dipartimento di statistica G Parenti, Universita di Firenze. abiggeri@ds.unifi.it']",,['ita'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Catchment Area, Health', '*Coal Mining', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Environmental Illness/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['Suppl/2006/EP_V30I1S1.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2006 Jan-Feb;30(1 Suppl 1):5-95.,,,,['Epidemiol Prev. 2006 Jul-Oct;30(4-5):210-1; author reply 211-2.

Postnatal stem cells used as such or after in vitro manipulation hold out strong hopes for reconstructive therapies. For instance, the grafting of native haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) restores haematopoiesis in genetically deficient individuals or in lethally conditioned leukaemic patients, and systemic injection of in vitro amplified mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) induces recovery of bone growth in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. Moreover, cells differentiated in vitro from postnatal stem cells exhibiting a specific function can also be used for cell therapy. Myeloid dendritic cells (DC) derived from cultures of HSC may induce tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes to eradicate the tumour via antigen recognition. In addition, long-lived MSC has been engineered to secrete specific proteins coded by a transgene and used as a source of therapeutic molecules in vivo. All these approaches require large quantities of cells that cannot be obtained (with the exception of HSC) directly from the donor. In vitro procedures allowing the production of therapeutic cells from postnatal stem cells are needed and are at present under development. Below we discuss the rationale and methods currently available for generation of therapeutic cells derived from haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells.","['Kindler, Vincent', 'Suva, Domizio', 'Soulas, Caroline', 'Chapuis, Bernard']","['Kindler V', 'Suva D', 'Soulas C', 'Chapuis B']","['Haematology Service, Geneva University Hospital, 25 Micheli-du-Crest, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland. vincent.kindler@hcuge.ch']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transplantation/*trends', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta/therapy', 'Papio']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2006 May 27;136(21-22):333-7.,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that GGH activity is directly related to GGH messenger RNA expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of patients with a wild-type germline GGH genotype. We identified two CpG islands (CpG1 and CpG2) in the region extending from the GGH promoter through the first exon and into intron 1 and showed that methylation of both CpG islands in the GGH promoter (seen in leukemia cells from approximately 15% of patients with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage ALL) is associated with significantly reduced GGH mRNA expression and catalytic activity and with significantly higher accumulation of MTX polyglutamates (MTXPG(4-7)) in ALL cells. Furthermore, methylation of CpG1 was leukemia-cell specific and had a pronounced effect on GGH expression, whereas methylation of CpG2 was common in leukemia cells and normal leukocytes but did not significantly alter GGH expression. These findings indicate that GGH activity in human leukemia cells is regulated by epigenetic changes, in addition to previously recognized genetic polymorphisms and karyotypic abnormalities, which collectively determine interindividual differences in GGH activity and influence MTXPG accumulation in leukemia cells.","['Cheng, Qing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Cheng Q', 'Cheng C', 'Crews KR', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Hematological Malignancies Program, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/genetics/*physiology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9297(07)63134-6 [pii]', '10.1086/505645 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 2006 Aug;79(2):264-74. doi: 10.1086/505645.

Imatinib has been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors and is under investigation for the therapy of several other malignant tumors. Since radiotherapy is an important treatment option in many tumors, combined effects of imatinib and radiation were analyzed here. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vitro, U87 cells (human glioblastoma), A431 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma), and HUVECs (human umbilical venous endothelial cells) were treated with imatinib alone and in combination with radiation. Clonogenic survival and cell proliferation were determined with and without additional radiation (0-10 Gy). In vivo, U87 and A431 cells (5 x 10(6)) were subcutaneously injected into hind limbs of balb c nu/u mice. Drug and radiation treatments started on day 0 when tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm(3). Tumors were treated with 5 x 5 Gy (U87) or 6 x 5 Gy (A431) on consecutive days from day 0. Imatinib was administered orally via the mouse diet starting on day 0 until the end of observation. Tumor growth and microvessel density (CD31 IHC) were analyzed. RESULTS: In vitro, imatinib increased radiosensitivity of U87 and A431 tumor cells as well as HUVECs in both clonogenic and cell number/proliferation assays. The enhancement of radiosensitivity in HUVECs was comparable to that observed in the tumor cells. In vivo, the concurrent and continuous administration of imatinib increased tumor growth delay of fractionated radiotherapy in the carcinoma and the glioblastoma models at reduced microvessel densities. No apparent additional toxicity by the combination of radiation and imatinib versus monotherapies was observed in terms of weight, skin, or general behavior. CONCLUSION: Imatinib (Gleevec), a ""molecular targeted"" approved drug for human malignancies, can enhance the tumor growth reduction induced by fractionated radiotherapy in glioblastoma and carcinoma models. The data provides a rationale to further investigate the combination.","['Oertel, Susanne', 'Krempien, Robert', 'Lindel, Katja', 'Zabel, Angelika', 'Milker-Zabel, Stephanie', 'Bischof, Marc', 'Lipson, Kenneth E', 'Peschke, Peter', 'Debus, Jurgen', 'Abdollahi, Amir', 'Huber, Peter E']","['Oertel S', 'Krempien R', 'Lindel K', 'Zabel A', 'Milker-Zabel S', 'Bischof M', 'Lipson KE', 'Peschke P', 'Debus J', 'Abdollahi A', 'Huber PE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, and University of Heidelberg, Medical School, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

The last decennia, intense research has been carried out on different fronts. On one side, development of normal thymocyte and its regulation mechanisms have been studied in multiple mouse models and subsequently validated. On the other side, molecular cytogenetics (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and mutation analysis revealed cytogenetically cryptic aberrations in almost all cases of T-ALL. Also, expression microarray analysis disclosed gene expression signatures that recapitulate specific stages of thymocyte development. Investigations are still very much actual, fed by the discovery of new genetic aberrations. In this review, we present a summary of the current cytogenetic changes associated with T-ALL. The genes deregulated by translocations or mutations appear to encode proteins that are also implicated in T-cell development, which prompted us to review the 'normal' and 'leukemogenic' functions of these transcription regulators. To conclude, we show that the paradigm of multistep leukemogenesis is very much applicable to T-ALL and that the different genetic insults collaborate to maintain self-renewal capacity, and induce proliferation and differentiation arrest of T-lymphoblasts.

To address this, we compared conventional cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) in a large multicenter study (n=794). The ability to obtain abnormal metaphases was associated with a poor prognosis, which was worse if Delta13, p53 deletion or t(4;14) was present, but only Delta13 remained significant on multivariate analysis. Patients with Delta13, by either cytogenetics or iFISH, had a poor prognosis. However, when cases with Delta13 detectable by both cytogenetics and iFISH were separated from those detected by iFISH only, the poor prognosis of iFISH-detectable Delta13 disappeared; their outcome matched that of patients with no detectable Delta13 (P=0.115). Addition of ploidy status to iFISH-Delta13 did not affect the prognostic value of the test. Indeed both cytogenetics and iFISH Delta13 divided both hyperdiploidy and nonhyperdiploidy into two groups with similar prognoses, indicating that the poor prognosis of ploidy is entirely due to its association with Delta13. We conclude that Delta13 detected by metaphase analysis is a critical prognostic factor in myeloma. Absence of Delta13, even in those patients yielding only normal or no metaphases, is associated with a relatively good prognosis.","['Chiecchio, L', 'Protheroe, R K M', 'Ibrahim, A H', 'Cheung, K L', 'Rudduck, C', 'Dagrada, G P', 'Cabanas, E D', 'Parker, T', 'Nightingale, M', 'Wechalekar, A', 'Orchard, K H', 'Harrison, C J', 'Cross, N C P', 'Morgan, G J', 'Ross, F M']","['Chiecchio L', 'Protheroe RK', 'Ibrahim AH', 'Cheung KL', 'Rudduck C', 'Dagrada GP', 'Cabanas ED', 'Parker T', 'Nightingale M', 'Wechalekar A', 'Orchard KH', 'Harrison CJ', 'Cross NC', 'Morgan GJ', 'Ross FM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund UK Myeloma Forum Cytogenetics Group, Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton, Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, Wilts, UK. laura.chiecchio@salisbury.nhs.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404304 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404304 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1610-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404304.

Mononuclear cells isolated from the ascites from a patient with AMoL (French-American-British classification; acute myeloid leukemia M5a) were isolated and passaged by liquid culture medium for a year. TZ-1 cells revealed typical monocytic features in morphology and had a t(1;11)(p32;q23) translocation. The immunoprofiling as determined by flow cytometry showed that TZ-1 cells are positive for myeloid and monocytic markers with lymphoid-associated markers. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed MLL-EPS15 fusion transcript and protein. Taken together, these results suggest that TZ-1 is a new monocytic leukemia cell line with t(1;11) translocation and fusion gene MLL-EPS15.

Ranges of the relative proportions of CCR7+ cells within CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were broad, but did not differ between the two sources of allografts. By multivariate analysis, high percentage of donor-derived CD4+CCR7+ T cells (>73.5%) significantly correlated with incidence, earliness of onset and severity of acute GVHD, conferring the highest adjusted hazard ratio (HR=3.9; 95% confidence interval 1.4-10.8; P=0.008) without interfering in other clinical events, especially chronic GVHD and relapse.

Despite its high frequency, nothing is known about the formation and the pathogenetic outcome of this abnormality. To address these issues, we performed a detailed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) investigation of four acute lymphoblastic leukemias, one acute myeloid leukemia, and two myxoid liposarcomas with i(7q). Using FISH with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) mapping between 7p12.2 and 7q11.2, the breakpoints (BPs) in all seven cases were shown to cluster to an approximately 340 kb segment at 7p11.2, covered by the overlapping BAC probes RP11-760D2 and RP11-10F11. Thus, the i(7q) should formally be designated idic(7) (p11.2). In one of the cases, FISH with fosmids could narrow down the BP further to an 80-kb sequence delineated by G248P81983A10 and G248P8793H7. No known genes are located in the 340-kb BP cluster region, indicating that the idic(7)(p11.2) does not result in a fusion or deregulation of genes in this segment. The pathogenetically important outcome is thus likely to be an altered gene expression because of copy number changes. The clustering of breakpoints might be due to frequent intrachromosomal duplicons in the BP region.","['Schaad, K', 'Strombeck, B', 'Mandahl, N', 'Andersen, M K', 'Heim, S', 'Mertens, F', 'Johansson, B']","['Schaad K', 'Strombeck B', 'Mandahl N', 'Andersen MK', 'Heim S', 'Mertens F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Isochromosomes/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/07/29 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['93327 [pii]', '10.1159/000093327 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2006;114(2):126-30. doi: 10.1159/000093327.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 S.

The role of chemokines, especially CXCL10/interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), a chemokine to attract CXCR3+ T helper 1-type CD4+ T cells, has not been investigated thoroughly in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. B6 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with LP-BM5 and then injected every week with either an antibody against IP-10 or a control antibody. Eight weeks after infection, we analyzed the effect of IP-10 neutralization. Anti-IP-10 antibody treatment did not change the generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly of mice with MAIDS. The treatment significantly reduced the number of IP-10- and CXCR3-positive cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) but not the phenotypes and gross numbers of cells. In contrast, IP-10 neutralization reduced the number of mononuclear cells infiltrating into the pancreas.

IP-10 neutralization ameliorated the pancreatic lesions of mice with MAIDS probably by blocking the cellular infiltration of CD4+ T cells and IFN-gamma+ Mac-1+ cells into the pancreas at least at 8 wk after infection, suggesting that IP-10 and these cells might play a key role in the development of chronic autoimmune pancreatitis.","['Kawauchi, Yusuke', 'Suzuki, Kenji', 'Watanabe, Shiro', 'Yamagiwa, Satoshi', 'Yoneyama, Hiroyuki', 'Han, Gi Dong', 'Palaniyandi, Suresh S', 'Veeraveedu, Punniyakoti T', 'Watanabe, Kenichi', 'Kawachi, Hiroshi', 'Okada, Yoshiaki', 'Shimizu, Fujio', 'Asakura, Hitoshi', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Narumi, Shosaku']","['Kawauchi Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Watanabe S', 'Yamagiwa S', 'Yoneyama H', 'Han GD', 'Palaniyandi SS', 'Veeraveedu PT', 'Watanabe K', 'Kawachi H', 'Okada Y', 'Shimizu F', 'Asakura H', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Narumi S']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Specific tissue location need not be an obligatory requirement for a stem cell niche, particularly during embryogenesis, where cells exist in a dynamic environment. We investigated autoregulatory fixed-location-independent processes controlling cell fate by analyzing the spatial organization of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using quantitative single-cell immunocytochemistry and a computational approach involving Delaunay triangulation. ESC colonies demonstrated radial organization of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, Nanog, and Oct4 (among others) in the presence and absence of exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Endogenous self-renewal signaling resulted from autocrine non-LIF gp130 ligands, which buffered cells against differentiation upon exogenous LIF deprivation. Together with a radial organization of differential responsiveness to gp130 ligands within colonies, autocrine signaling produced a radial organization of self-renewal, generating a fixed-location-independent autoregulatory niche. These findings reveal fundamental properties of niches and elucidate mechanisms colonies of cells use to transition between fates during morphogenesis.","['Davey, Ryan E', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Davey RE', 'Zandstra PW']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006-0216 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2006-0216 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Nov;24(11):2538-48. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0216.

In this study, we evaluated a number of control genes with the application of several novel criteria, including control gene performance on serial patient sample testing and in a residual disease model.

Therefore, we studied 152 paraffin-embedded trephines with CMPD and related disorders for the presence of the V617F mutation, using both allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR with subsequent digestion with BsaXI. Only 6 of 152 (4%) samples were not evaluable because of poor DNA quality. The V617F mutation was detected in 27 of 28 (96%) cases of polycythemia vera, 17 of 23 (74%) cases of essential thrombocythemia, 28 of 45 (62%) cases of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, six of eight (75%) cases of CMPD unclassified, and two of four (50%) cases of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome. Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (four cases), reactive (secondary) erythrocytosis (14 cases), and thrombocytosis (one case) as well as normal controls (19 cases) all lacked the V617F mutation. Based on results of BsaXI digestion and sequencing, 24 of 54 (44%) evaluable V617F+ cases were considered homozygously mutated.

However, recent clinical data and mouse models point to insertional activation of cellular proto-oncogenes as a dose-limiting side effect of retroviral gene delivery that potentially induces leukemia. Self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors do not contain the terminal repetition of the enhancer/promoter, theoretically attenuating the interaction with neighboring cellular genes. With a new assay based on in vitro expansion of primary murine hematopoietic cells and selection in limiting dilution, we showed that SIN vectors using a strong internal retroviral enhancer/promoter may also transform cells by insertional mutagenesis. Most transformed clones, including those obtained after dose escalation of SIN vectors, showed insertions upstream of the third exon of Evi1 and in reverse orientation to its transcriptional orientation. Normalizing for the vector copy number, we found the transforming capacity of SIN vectors to be significantly reduced when compared with corresponding LTR vectors. Additional modifications of SIN vectors may further increase safety. Improved cell-culture assays will likely play an important role in the evaluation of insertional mutagenesis.","['Modlich, Ute', 'Bohne, Jens', 'Schmidt, Manfred', 'von Kalle, Christof', 'Knoss, Sabine', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Modlich U', 'Bohne J', 'Schmidt M', 'von Kalle C', 'Knoss S', 'Schambach A', 'Baum C']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA 107492-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/virology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Safety', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52436-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-024976 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 15;108(8):2545-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-024976.

In the present study, CD38-expression levels in B-CLL cells and T cells from 204 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and correlated with clinical and molecular risk parameters. CD38 expression significantly differed in the neoplastic clone from patients with low versus advanced stage, irrespective of the sex of patients. In contrast, CD38 expression was generally higher in T cells from female compared with male patients but only increased in male patients in a stage-dependent manner. In male patients, combined analysis of CD38 in T cells and B-CLL cells identified 4 subgroups with significantly different treatment-free survival. Multivariate analysis including Rai stage and molecular risk parameters of the neoplastic clone identified CD38-expression levels in T cells as an independent prognostic factor in male patients. Combined analysis of CD38 in B-CLL and T cells is superior in predicting outcome of male B-CLL patients than either parameter alone.

We evaluated how CD16 polymorphisms, and mAb with modified affinity for target antigen and CD16, affect natural killer (NK) cell phenotype when CD20(+) malignant B cells were also present. The mAb consisted of rituximab (R), anti-CD20 with enhanced affinity for CD20 (AME-B), and anti-CD20 with enhanced affinity for both CD20 and CD16 (AME-D). Higher concentrations of mAb were needed to induce CD16 modulation, CD54 up-regulation, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) on NK cells from subjects with the lower affinity CD16 polymorphism. The dose of mAb needed to induce NK activation was lower with AME-D irrespective of CD16 polymorphism. At saturating mAb concentrations, peak NK activation was greater for AME-D. Similar results were found with measurement of CD16 modulation, CD54 up-regulation, and ADCC.

A combined MRI set consisting of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton-density-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and WM, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid proportional volume maps from a spatially normalized atlas were analyzed with a neural network segmentation based on a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM). Segmented maps were manually classified to identify the most hyperintense WM region and the normal-appearing genu region. Signal intensity differences normalized to the genu within each examination were generated for four time points in 228 children. A second Kohonen SOM was trained on the first examination data and divided the WM into normal-appearing or LE groups. Reviewing labels from the CAD tool revealed a consistency measure of 89.8% (167 of 186) within patients. The overall agreement between the CAD tool and the consensus reading of two trained observers was 84.1% (535 of 636), with 84.2% (170 of 202) agreement in the training set and 84.1% (365 of 434) agreement in the testing set. These results suggest that subtle therapy-induced LE can be objectively and reproducibly detected in children treated for cancer using this CAD approach based on relative differences in quantitative signal intensity measures normalized within each examination.","['Glass, John O', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Li, Chin-Shang', 'Laningham, Fred H', 'Helton, Kathleen J', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Glass JO', 'Reddick WE', 'Li CS', 'Laningham FH', 'Helton KJ', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Translational Imaging Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. john.glass@stjude.org""]",,['eng'],"['R01 CA090246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA90246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090246-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Magn Reson Imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging,8214883,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brain Diseases/*chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Infant', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2005/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0730-725X(06)00087-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mri.2006.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Magn Reson Imaging. 2006 Jul;24(6):785-91. doi: 10.1016/j.mri.2006.02.001.

We have reported that cultured human fetal membrane chorion cells undergoing apoptosis by influenza virus infection secrete unidentified heat-stable monocyte differentiation-inducing (MDI) factors. In this study, cellular, biological and immunochemical characteristics of MDI factors were investigated using human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and cell adhesion assays. The treatment of THP-1 cells with culture supernatants from the influenza virus-infected chorion cells induced the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction ability, which was inhibited by the addition of superoxide dismutase and diphenyleneiodonium chloride, an inhibitor for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. The phenomenon was also observed in human peripheral blood monocytes and histiocytic leukemia U937 cells, but not in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. The induction of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and adhesion abilities in THP-1 cells was closely correlated with the concentrations of interleukin-6 protein in the culture supernatants. These abilities were inhibited to approximately 60% by the addition of antibodies against interleukin-6, or alpha-chain (gp80) or beta-chain (gp130) of IL-6 receptor. The induction of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was increased by the addition of supernatants from amniochorion tissue cultures after influenza virus infection. These results indicate that chorion cell-derived interleukin-6 is partly responsible for monocyte differentiation to macrophages capable of generating superoxide anion. It is possible that these pathways represent part of the mechanism for birth complications associated with intrauterine influenza infection in pregnancy.","['Uchide, Noboru', 'Tadera, Chiho', 'Sarai, Hiroko', 'Ohyama, Kunio', 'Bessho, Toshio', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Uchide N', 'Tadera C', 'Sarai H', 'Ohyama K', 'Bessho T', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan. uchide@ps.toyaku.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,['0 (Interleukin-6)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorion/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extraembryonic Membranes/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/physiology', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Orthomyxoviridae/*growth & development', 'U937 Cells']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/19 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(06)00161-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2006.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2006;38(11):1926-38. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2006.05.014.

Another arsenic compound, realgar (As2S2), has long been used as a therapeutic agent to treat some diseases in ancient China and Europe, and its medicinal effects have attracted increasing attentions in recent years. However, its poor water-solubility unfortunately results in poor bioavailability and hampers it from being studied and used for possible clinical application. In this study, nanosized realgar particles were prepared by cryo-grinding with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and/or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Major physical properties of the respective nanosized realgar particles were characterized. Co-grinding realgar with PVP and/or SDS produced smaller and more monodisperse suspension of nanoparticles. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of such nanosized realgar particles on selected human ovarian (CI80-13S, OVCAR, OVCAR-3) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines were investigated. Significant anti-proliferation effect of these realgar nanoparticles on these cancer cell lines was observed. CI80-13S was most sensitive to the nanosized realgar particles with IC50 values of less than 1 microM as As2S2, whereas the other cancer cell lines had IC50 values in a range of 2-4 microM as As2S2. The cytotoxic activity of the realgar nanoparticles to these human gynecological cell lines was comparable to arsenic trioxide observed previously. In these cancer cell lines, the cytotoxic effects were caused by apoptosis as confirmed by cell cycle and DNA laddering analysis. In in vivo study, a remarkable increase in urinary recovery of arsenic was observed in rats after a single oral administration of the cryo-ground realgar particle suspension. Ranging from 58.5 to 69.6% of the administered dose of arsenic was recovered in urine in the first 48 h from the PVP and/or SDS co-ground preparations; whereas the original realgar powder gave a urinary recovery of only 24.9%. The finding suggested that size reduction of realgar particles to nano levels could enhance its bioavailability substantially.","['Wu, Jin-Zhu', 'Ho, Paul C']","['Wu JZ', 'Ho PC']","['Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Excipients)', '0 (Sulfides)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Compounding', 'Excipients', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanostructures', 'Particle Size', 'Povidone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Sulfides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(06)00120-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2006.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2006 Sep;29(1):35-44. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2006.05.002.

Should young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia be treated in the same way as children?].,2554-8,"INTRODUCTION: Data seem to indicate that young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a better survival rate when treated with paediatric protocols than with adult ALL protocols. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical characteristics and outcome of all children and young adults 10-19 years of age diagnosed with ALL in Denmark between 1992 and 2001. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 99 patients 10-19 years of age with ALL in Denmark during a 10-year period found in the complete NOPHO (Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology) registry and through the Danish Cancer Registry and local pathology databases. Data were retrieved by reviewing patients' medical charts. 61 children (10-14 years) were treated on paediatric protocols, and 38 young adults (15-19 years) were diagnosed with ALL. Data were reported as of 1 January 2005. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups with respect to the distribution of T-ALL, CNS leukemia, total WBC and high-risk chromosomal abnormalities. There was a statistically significant lower event-free survival rate (EFS) (p < 0.01) and lower overall survival rate (p < 0.01) in young adults than in 10-14-year-old children (0.38 vs. 0.60 and 0.47 vs. 0.67). There were more transplant-related deaths in the young adults. The higher treatment intensity in children may be an explanatory factor. Children were given more prednisone, vincristine and high-dose methotrexate than were the young adults. CONCLUSION: Young adult patients with ALL might benefit from therapy with paediatric NOPHO ALL protocols.","['Schroder, Henrik', 'Kjeldstad, Marthe', 'Boesen, Anne Marie', 'Nielsen, Ove Juul', 'Schmidt, Kai Gjerloff', 'Johnsen, Hans Erik', 'Gregersen, Henrik', 'Gustafsson, Goran']","['Schroder H', 'Kjeldstad M', 'Boesen AM', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Schmidt KG', 'Johnsen HE', 'Gregersen H', 'Gustafsson G']","['Arhus Universitetshospital, Skejby Sygehus, Borneafdelingen, DK-8200 Arhus. hsa@sks.aaa.dk']",,['dan'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['VP47513 [pii]'],ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2006 Jun 26;168(26-32):2554-8.,,,,,,,,,,,Akut lymfoblastaer leukaemi hos born og unge pa 10-19 ar i Danmark.

The mechanisms by which CDCP1 expression is regulated, and the clinical implications of this marker, have not been clarified. In this report, we examine the epigenetic regulation of CDCP1 expression in cell lines and clinical samples from patients with breast cancer. Many CpG sequences were localized around the transcription initiation site of CDCP1. These CpG motifs were found to be poorly methylated in cell lines with high levels of CDCP1 expression and heavily methylated in cell lines with low levels of CDCP1 expression. The in vitro methylation of CpG sites decreased CDCP1 promoter activity, and the addition of a demethylating reagent restored activity. In 25 breast cancer samples, an inverse correlation was noted between the CDCP1 expression level and the proportion of methylated to non-methylated CpG sites. Tumours with high-level CDCP1 expression showed higher levels of proliferation, as revealed by immunohistochemical detection of the MIB-1 antigen, than tumours with low-level CDCP1 expression. These findings indicate that the expression of CDCP1 is regulated by methylation of its promoter region in tumours.

Originally identified in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells as a highly phosphorylated substrate for the chimeric p210(bcr-abl) protein, DOK1 was suspected to play a role in leukemogenesis. However, p62(DOK1-/-) fibroblast knockout cells were found to have enhanced MAPK signaling and proliferation due to growth factors, suggesting negative regulatory capabilities for DOK1. The role of DOK1 and DOK2 in leukemogeneis thus is enigmatic. The data in this report show that both the DOK1 and the DOK2 adaptor proteins are constitutively expressed in the myelomonoblastic leukemia cell line, HL-60, and that expression of both proteins is induced by the chemotherapeutic differentiation causing agents, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). Ectopic expression of either protein enhances atRA- or VD3-induced growth arrest, differentiation, and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and results in increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. DOK1 and DOK2 are similarly effective in these capabilities. The data provide evidence that DOK1 and DOK2 proteins have a similar role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and are positive regulators of the MAPK signaling pathway in this context.","['Lamkin, Thomas J', 'Chin, Vivian', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Lamkin TJ', 'Chin V', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",,['eng'],['T32 ES007052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (DOK2 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20667 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2006 Aug;81(8):603-15. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20667.,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB009298', 'GENBANK/NT022184', 'GENBANK/NT023666']",,,,,,,,

T-cell monoclonality is helpful for the screening of EBV-infected T-cell LPD in patients with EBV-genome burden and is easily shown with T-cell-receptor rearrangement or the T-cell repertoire, whereas NK-cell monoclonality is difficult to prove due to its lacking such rearranged receptors. We investigated a set of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and also CD94-NKG2 heterodimers on NK cells, namely the NK-cell repertoire. Skewed repertoires were seen in all patients with EBV-infected NK-cell LPD, but not in any patients with EBV-infected T-cell LPD and were restored only after successful treatment.

We report the results of rituximab treatment for 14 patients suffering from CLL-associated AIHA. They developed a direct antiglobulin test positive AIHA at a mean time of 47 months (range 0-135 months) from the diagnosis of CLL. In 3 cases AIHA was diagnosed at the same time as CLL. Only 1 patient had fludarabine-related AIHA. All patients received steroids as first-line treatment. At a mean time of 46 days (range 1-210 days) from the diagnosis of AIHA all patients received rituximab at a dosage of 375 mg/m(2)/weekly for 4 weeks. All patients except 3 (2 died of cardiac failure or sepsis soon after the third cycle and 1 HCV-positive patient experienced a rise in serum amino transferases) completed the scheduled four programmed cycles. First injection side effects of rituximab were minimal. All but 2 patients showed an increase in hemoglobin levels in response to rituximab (mean value 3.6 g/dl; range 0.7-10 g/dl) and a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count and lymph nodes and spleen volume. Nine patients required packed red cell transfusions before starting rituximab; 5 no longer needed transfusions just after the second cycle and another patient after the fourth cycle. Three patients (22%) were considered to fully respond and 7 (50%) only responded partially. At a mean follow-up of 17 months, 8 patients were still alive, 6 of them transfusion-free.

Constitutively activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) appears to be a molecular basis for the aberrant growth and cytokine gene expression observed in ATL cells, thereby serving as an ideal target in the treatment of ATL. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) is a new NF-kappaB inhibitor that is a 5-dehydroxymethyl derivative of epoxyquinomicin C, having a 4-hydroxy-5,6-epoxycyclohexenone structure similar to panepoxydone. This unique compound acts in the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells and induces apoptotic cell death. In addition, DHMEQ selectively targets HTLV-1-infected cells in the peripheral blood of virus carriers in vitro, resulting in a decreased number of infected cells. We have concluded that blocking NF-kappaB is a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of ATL. As a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, DHMEQ is a promising compound for translating this strategy into clinical medicine.","['Horie, Ryouichi', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Horie R', 'Watanabe T', 'Umezawa K']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan. rhorie@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Drug News Perspect,Drug news & perspectives,8809164,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cyclohexanones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['985934 [pii]', '10.1358/dnp.2006.19.4.985934 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug News Perspect. 2006 May;19(4):201-9. doi: 10.1358/dnp.2006.19.4.985934.,49,,['Copyright 2006 Prous Science'],,,,,,,,,,,

No studies have indicated that exercise training affects DC function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 5-week periodized exercise training and active recovery program on the development of DCs, and to test their effect on the antitumor immunity of mononuclear cells (MNC) from blood and spleen against human leukemic U937 and murine lymphoma Yac-1 cells, respectively. METHODS: Male Fisher 344 rats were divided into 2 groups: exercise and non-exercise group. The training protocol consisted of running on a motor-driven treadmill 6 days a week for consecutive 5 weeks, during which the running time, treadmill speed, and incline gradient were increased weekly. Active recovery parameters were set at 30% of the intensity of the previous day. RESULTS: DC numbers increased significantly (P<0.05) in the exercise group compared to controls, but there were no significant changes in the expression of surface antigens CD80 and CD86. In exercise group MNC-conditioned medium (CM) prepared with 50 microg/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA) significantly inhibited proliferation of U937 cells, and splenocyte-CM with PHA at 20 and 40 microg/mL significantly inhibited proliferation of YAC-1 cells greater than control group. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-week periodized exercise training with active recovery promotes the number of DCs and enhances the activity of DCs against tumor cells.","['Liao, H F', 'Chiang, L M', 'Yen, C C', 'Chen, Y Y', 'Zhuang, R R', 'Lai, L Y', 'Chiang, J', 'Chen, Y J']","['Liao HF', 'Chiang LM', 'Yen CC', 'Chen YY', 'Zhuang RR', 'Lai LY', 'Chiang J', 'Chen YJ']","['Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Sports Med Phys Fitness,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,0376337,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis', 'Blood', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Running/physiology', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2006 Jun;46(2):307-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..).

To gain insight into the mechanisms of relapse, we analyzed gene-expression profiles in 35 matched diagnosis/relapse pairs as well as 60 uniformly treated children at relapse using the Affymetrix platform. Matched-pair analyses revealed significant differences in the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis between diagnostic and early-relapse samples. Many of these pathways have been implicated in tumorigenesis previously and are attractive targets for intervention strategies. In contrast, no common pattern of changes was observed among late-relapse pairs. Early-relapse samples were more likely to be similar to their respective diagnostic sample while we noted greater divergence in gene-expression patterns among late-relapse pairs. Comparison of expression profiles of early- versus late-relapse samples indicated that early-relapse clones were characterized by overexpression of biologic pathways associated with cell-cycle regulation. These results suggest that early-relapse results from the emergence of a related clone, characterized by the up-regulation of genes mediating cell proliferation.

We have developed a novel technique for detecting CpG-methylated DNA termed methyl-binding (MB)-PCR. This technique utilizes a recombinant protein with high affinity for CpG-methylated DNA that is coated onto the walls of a PCR vessel and selectively captures methylated DNA fragments from a mixture of genomic DNA. The retention and, hence, the degree of methylation of a specific DNA fragment (e.g. a CpG island promoter of a specific gene) is detected in the same tube by gene-specific PCR. MB-PCR does not require bisulfite treatment or methylation-sensitive restriction and provides a quick, simple and extremely sensitive technique allowing the detection of methylated DNA, in particular in tumor tissue or tumor cells from limited samples. Using this novel approach, we determined the methylation status of several established and candidate tumor suppressor genes and identified the ICSBP gene, encoding the myeloid and B-cell-specific transcription factor interferon consensus sequence-binding protein, as a target for aberrant hypermethylation in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Gebhard, Claudia', 'Schwarzfischer, Lucia', 'Pham, Thu Hang', 'Andreesen, Reinhard', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Rehli, Michael']","['Gebhard C', 'Schwarzfischer L', 'Pham TH', 'Andreesen R', 'Mackensen A', 'Rehli M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, 93042, Regensburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (MBD2 protein, human)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/chemistry', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/07/25 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['34/11/e82 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkl437 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jul 5;34(11):e82. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkl437.,,20060705,,,PMC1488883,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 interacts with the mitochondrial import receptor Tom70, and such interaction requires an internal domain of Mcl-1 that contains an EELD motif.

Furthermore, Mcl-1 is significantly less targeted to mitochondria in Tom70 knockdown than in the control cells.

One subtype of CN, Kostmann syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized histopathologically by early-stage maturation arrest of myeloid differentiation. CN with similar clinical features occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder and many sporadic cases also have been reported. This genetic heterogeneity suggests that several pathophysiological mechanisms may lead to this common clinical phenotype. Recent studies on the genetic bases of CN have detected inherited or spontaneous point mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA 2) in about 60% to 80% of patients and, less commonly, mutations in other genes. Acquisition of additional genetic defects during the course of the disease, for example, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor gene mutations and cytogenetic aberrations, indicates an underlying genetic instability as a common feature for all congenital neutropenia subtypes. Data on more than 600 patients with CN collected by the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) demonstrate that, regardless of the particular CN subtype, more than 95% of these patients respond to recombinant human (rHu)G-CSF with ANCs that can be maintained above 1.0 x 10(9)/L.

Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 translocates to damage-induced nuclear foci containing BRCA1, BRCA2, and Rad51, thereby protecting the genome. Because hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress is a feature of all somatic cells, this aspect of FA protein function cannot account for the nearly universal development of bone marrow failure. There is strong in vitro and in vivo evidence that at least some of the FA proteins promote survival signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells by forming complexes with signaling molecules. Because associations with heat shock proteins occur in this context, we suggest that these proteins function as co-chaperones and scaffolds that organize proper responses to a wide variety of extracellular cues, some global, and some specific for hematopoietic cells.","['Bagby, Grover C', 'Alter, Blanche P']","['Bagby GC', 'Alter BP']","['OHSU Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine and Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA. grover@ohsu.edu']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,"['*Fanconi Anemia/blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/08/30 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(06)00079-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2006 Jul;43(3):147-56. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.04.005.,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world-wide highest incidence of CLL and the existence of a systematic cancer registration since 1943 make Denmark a perfect place for epidemiological and genealogical investigations in the search for the genetics of the lymphoproliferative disorders. In Scandinavia, we see no signs of anticipation but marked linkage between parents and children, where the combination CLL in parent and CLL in child is more predominant than CLL in parent and a child with any other type of lymphoproliferative disorder. This same conservative pattern is also seen in parent-children transportation of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Tax, the viral oncoprotein, is considered a major contributor to cell cycle deregulation in HTLV-I transformed cells by either directly disrupting cellular factors (protein-protein interactions) or altering their transcription profile. Tax transactivates these cellular promoters by interacting with transcription factors such as CREB/ATF, NF-kappaB, and SRF. Therefore by examining which factors upregulate a particular set of promoters we may begin to understand how Tax orchestrates leukemia development. RESULTS: We observed that CTLL cells stably expressing wild-type Tax (CTLL/WT) exhibited aneuploidy as compared to a Tax clone deficient for CREB transactivation (CTLL/703). To better understand the contribution of Tax transactivation through the CREB/ATF pathway to the aneuploid phenotype, we performed microarray analysis comparing CTLL/WT to CTLL/703 cells. Promoter analysis of altered genes revealed that a subset of these genes contain CREB/ATF consensus sequences. While these genes had diverse functions, smaller subsets of genes were found to be involved in G2/M phase regulation, in particular kinetochore assembly. Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of CREB, Tax and RNA Polymerase II at the p97Vcp and Sgt1 promoters in vivo through chromatin immunoprecipitation in CTLL/WT cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the development of aneuploidy in Tax-expressing cells may occur in response to an alteration in the transcription profile, in addition to direct protein interactions.","['de la Fuente, Cynthia', 'Gupta, Madhur V', 'Klase, Zachary', 'Strouss, Katharine', 'Cahan, Patrick', 'McCaffery, Timothy', 'Galante, Anthony', 'Soteropoulos, Patricia', 'Pumfery, Anne', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['de la Fuente C', 'Gupta MV', 'Klase Z', 'Strouss K', 'Cahan P', 'McCaffery T', 'Galante A', 'Soteropoulos P', 'Pumfery A', 'Fujii M', 'Kashanchi F']","['The George Washington University Medical Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Washington, DC 20037, USA. bcmclf@gwumc.edu']",,['eng'],"['AI44357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '13969/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI43894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AI044357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetochores/physiology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/genetics/virology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-3-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-3-43 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2006 Jul 5;3:43. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-3-43.,,20060705,,,PMC1553470,,,,,,,,,

Adaphostin significantly inhibited growth of all cell lines (50% inhibition of cell proliferation [IC50] 0.5-1 microM) except K562 (IC50 13 microM). Ph-positive IM-resistant cell lines showed significant cross resistance to adaphostin. Simultaneous or sequential treatment with adaphostin and IM did not exert a synergistic effect in any KBM line. Adaphostin induced superoxide and apoptosis in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion in both Ph-positive and Ph-negative cells. Adaphostin selectively inhibited colony growth of cells from CML (IM-sensitive and IM-resistant) and AML patients. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins after treatment with adaphostin revealed alternate effects in different cells consistent with the modulation of multiple targets.

Using HLA-A*3101- and -A*3303-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones generated from different post-HSCT recipients, we identified two novel mHag epitopes encoded by the leader sequence of cathepsin H (CTSH) isoform a. The nonameric sequence ATLPLLCAR was defined as an HLA-A*3101-restricted epitope (CTSH(R)/A31), while a decameric peptide featuring a one N-terminal amino acid extension, WATLPLLCAR, was presented by HLA-A*3303 (CTSH(R)/A33). The immunogenicity of both epitopes was totally dependent on the polymorphic C-terminal arginine residue and substitution with glycine completely abolished binding to the corresponding HLA molecules. Thus, the immunogenicity of this mHag is exerted by differential HLA binding capacity. CTSH is relatively ubiquitously expressed at protein levels, thus it may be involved in GVHD and anti-leukaemic/tumour responses. Interestingly, however, CTL clones predominantly lysed targets of haematopoietic cell origin, which could not be explained in terms of the immunoproteasome system. Although the mechanisms involved in the differential susceptibility remain to be determined, these data suggest that CTSH-encoded mHags could be targets for GVL effects.","['Torikai, H', 'Akatsuka, Y', 'Miyazaki, M', 'Tsujimura, A', 'Yatabe, Y', 'Kawase, T', 'Nakao, Y', 'Tsujimura, K', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Morishima, Y', 'Kodera, Y', 'Kuzushima, K', 'Takahashi, T']","['Torikai H', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Miyazaki M', 'Tsujimura A', 'Yatabe Y', 'Kawase T', 'Nakao Y', 'Tsujimura K', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Morishima Y', 'Kodera Y', 'Kuzushima K', 'Takahashi T']","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Centre Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (CTSH protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (Cathepsin H)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cathepsin H', 'Cathepsins/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Minor Histocompatibility Loci/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree', 'Protein Isoforms/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/16 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6205 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06205.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Aug;134(4):406-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06205.x.

Selaginella tamariscina (ST) is a traditional medicinal plant for treatment of advanced cancer in the Orient. In the present study, the anticancer effect of ST was investigated by analyzing its potential to induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. ST-induced cytotoxicity of HL-60 cells was monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The apoptosis was determined by microscopic examination of apoptotic morphology, determination of DNA fragmentation by electrophoresis, activation of caspase-3, and protein expression of procaspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, Bcl-2, and Bax. ST was cytotoxic to HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, ST-induced cytotoxicity was suppressed by reactive oxygen species scavengers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. ST caused DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation, all characteristics of apoptosis. ST-induced apoptosis is accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and the specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP. Concomitantly, ST treatments led to an increase in the proapoptotic Bax levels, while Bcl-2 expression was decreased. Moreover, this effect was attenuated by SOD and catalase. These results suggest that oxidative stress may be involved in the cytotoxicity of ST, and that ST-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells is primarily mediated by the caspase activation pathway.","['Ahn, Seong-Hun', 'Mun, Yeun-Ja', 'Lee, Sung-Won', 'Kwak, Sup', 'Choi, Min-Kyu', 'Baik, Soon-Ki', 'Kim, Yeong-Mok', 'Woo, Won-Hong']","['Ahn SH', 'Mun YJ', 'Lee SW', 'Kwak S', 'Choi MK', 'Baik SK', 'Kim YM', 'Woo WH']","['Department of Herbal Resources, Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Jeonbuk, Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Selaginellaceae/*chemistry', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/analysis']",2006/07/11 09:00,2006/09/30 09:00,['2006/07/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jmf.2006.9.138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2006 Summer;9(2):138-44. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2006.9.138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elderly patients are increasingly affected by impairment of functional status (FS). FS is of prognostic relevance for survival in different tumours. Data for patients with AML are rare. Within a prospective trial we recruited patients with newly diagnosed AML and measured FS by two different methods: Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Sixty-three patients aged 19-85 years (median 61.1) were included. Twenty-three had prior myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS), 7 favourable, 17 unfavourable karyotype. Fifty received induction chemotherapy, 13 palliative chemotherapy. Median survival was 15.2 months (95% CI, 10.8-22.3) in all patients. Age, cytogenetic risk group, and impaired KPS and IADL significantly influenced median survival in univariate analysis. Impairment of IADL was the single most predictive variable.

In this study we show that PBOX-6-induced oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation occurs in the absence of caspase and CAD activation in CML cells. Dissection of the signalling pathway has revealed that induction of apoptosis requires the upstream activation of a trypsin-like serine protease that promotes the phosphorylation and inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. In addition, in this system chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are dispensable for high molecular weight DNA fragmentation, however are required for the activation of a relatively small manganese-dependent acidic endonuclease that is responsible for oligonucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate mitochondrial involvement during PBOX-6-induced apoptosis and suggest the existence of unidentified mitochondrial effectors of apoptosis.","['McGrath, L B', 'Onnis, V', 'Campiani, G', 'Williams, D C', 'Zisterer, D M', 'Mc Gee, M M']","['McGrath LB', 'Onnis V', 'Campiani G', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM', 'Mc Gee MM']","['UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland, margaret.mcgee@ucd.ie.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (semen liquefaction factor)', '0 (trypsin-like serine protease)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Extracts/analysis', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Manganese/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxazepines/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism']",2006/07/06 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/07/06 09:00'],"['2006/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-8968-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Sep;11(9):1473-87. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-8968-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we demonstrated that the novel synthetic cantharidin analogue CAN 032 possessed apoptotic activity on two human hepatoma cell lines Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma and SK-Hep-1 liver adenocarcinoma. However, its underlying mechanistic action on cancer cells remained unclear. Herein, we furthered our work by making use of KG1a acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and K562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) as experimental models. As anticipated, both leukaemia cell lines were sensitive to the cytotoxic action of CAN 032. The activity of CAN 032 was both dose- and time-course-dependent. CAN 032 readily inhibited the colony formation potential of both leukaemia cell lines. KG1a AML treated with CAN032 decreased G1 phase cell population, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, caspase 3 activation and hence DNA fragmentation. Pre-incubation of leukaemia cells with the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK could partially reversed the apoptotic action of CAN 032. This result suggested that the caspase- dependent pathway is necessary for the apoptotic action of CAN 032. CAN 032 provides a new direction for novel drug discovery in experimental cancer therapy.","['Kok, Stanton Hon Lung', 'Chui, Chung Hin', 'Lam, Wing Sze', 'Chen, Jien', 'Lau, Fung Yi', 'Wong, Raymond Siu Ming', 'Cheng, Gregory Yin Ming', 'Tang, Wing Ka', 'Cheng, Chor Hing', 'Tang, Johnny Cheuk On', 'Chan, Albert Sun Chi']","['Kok SH', 'Chui CH', 'Lam WS', 'Chen J', 'Lau FY', 'Wong RS', 'Cheng GY', 'Tang WK', 'Cheng CH', 'Tang JC', 'Chan AS']","['Cancer Drug Research and Development Centre, Central Laboratory of the Institute of Molecular Technology for Drug Discovery and Synthesis, Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, P.R.

Malignant cells almost always possess high activity and expression of telomerase. The aim of this study was to see whether there is any relationship between telomerase activity and expression and hTERT and hTERC gene amplification in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) cells. In addition telomere length was tested in leukemic cells at the time of diagnosis and during remission. Expression of the three components of telomerase (hTERT, hTERC and TP1) as well as telomerase activity was found both in ALL and ANLL cells. Telomerase activity was diminished in patients in remission. The leukemic cells showed considerable heterogeneity of terminal restriction fragments, that is telomere length. ALL cells showed a variable pattern of telomere length in contrast to ANLL cells which produced a predominantly short telomere pattern. Telomere length in the lymphocytes of leukemia patients was shorter in remission as compared to the time of diagnosis. FISH analysis revealed amplification of hTERT and hTERC genes in ALL and ANLL cells. Quantitative analysis showed that leukemic cells possess higher number of hTERT and hTERC copies than the normal PBL. Our results suggest that the activation of telomerase in leukemic cells is connected with amplification of hTERT and hTERC genes. The high expression and activity of telomerase found in leukemic cells may be partially explained by amplified hTERT and hTERC genes. Amplification of the telomerase genes seems to be a common event in carcinogenesis and may play a role in telomerase reactivation leading to cell immortalization.","['Nowak, Tomasz', 'Januszkiewicz, Danuta', 'Zawada, Mariola', 'Pernak, Monika', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Rembowska, Jolanta', 'Nowicka, Karina', 'Mankowski, Przemyslaw', 'Nowak, Jerzy']","['Nowak T', 'Januszkiewicz D', 'Zawada M', 'Pernak M', 'Lewandowski K', 'Rembowska J', 'Nowicka K', 'Mankowski P', 'Nowak J']","['Institute of Human Genetics PAN, Poznan, Poland. nowakjs@man.poznan.pl']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Telomerase/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/enzymology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/07/06 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/07/06 09:00'],"['2006/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2006 Aug;16(2):301-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, the PPARgamma ligand known as thiazolidinedione (TZD) was used for the treatment of diabetic patients. However, recent studies have shown that TZD also has an antitumor effect that inhibits cell growth in several types of human malignant neoplasms, including leukemia cell lines. Since pioglitazone is the only TZD currently available in clinics in Japan and the role of TZD in normal human hematopoietic cells or primary leukemia cells has not been previously reported, we investigated the effect of pioglitazone on human normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, primary leukemia cells, and leukemia cell lines (HL60, K562, U937, HEL, CEM, Jurkat, and NALM1). Pioglitazone inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. The viable cell numbers of HL60, K562, and Jurkat leukemia cell lines were profoundly reduced when the cells were cocultured with pioglitazone. Colony formation in the leukemia cell lines as well as the primary leukemia cells was significantly inhibited to 20-71% and 1-25% of that in control cultures by the addition of 100 and 300 microM of pioglitazone, respectively. However, the CFU-E and CFU-GM colonies of cells obtained from healthy volunteers were not altered in the presence of 100 microM of pioglitazone. Pioglitazone (300 microM) induced slight decrease of CFU-E and CFU-GM. BFU-E was more sensitive to pioglitazone than CFU-E and CFU-GM. Pioglitazone-induced growth inhibition in HL60 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, as has been reported for another TZD, troglitazone. Similar levels of PPARgamma protein were observed in both leukemia and normal bone marrow cells by Western blotting, suggesting that the expression of PPARgamma protein was not associated with the inhibitory potency of pioglitazone. In conclusion, our results suggest that pioglitazone may offer a new therapeutic approach to aid in the treatment of leukemia.","['Saiki, Minoru', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Yamazaki, Tetsuo', 'Itoh, Takeyoshi', 'Enomoto, Yuko', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Sawada, Umihiko', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Horie, Takashi']","['Saiki M', 'Hatta Y', 'Yamazaki T', 'Itoh T', 'Enomoto Y', 'Takeuchi J', 'Sawada U', 'Aizawa S', 'Horie T']","['Department of Hematology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', 'X4OV71U42S (Pioglitazone)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Pioglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology']",2006/07/06 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2006/07/06 09:00'],"['2006/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Aug;29(2):437-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MSB1-O derived from MD, the expression of a 40 kDa protein of p53 was decreased and that of a 32 kDa protein, a short form of p53, was increased during apoptosis induced by actinomycin D. In 1104B1 derived from AL, the expressions of 42 and 32 kDa of p53 were increased during the apoptosis. The short form of p53 was undetectable in these cell lines when apoptosis was blocked by the pretreatment with endonuclease inhibitor, Zn2+, protease inhibitors, TPCK and TLCK, or caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In the transcriptional level, the expressions of bcl-2 and IAP were decreased in these cell lines during actinomycin D-induced apoptosis, but no change was detected in the expression level of p53.

KIT null ES cells die when induced to differentiate upon withdrawal of leukaemia inhibitory factor in monolayer culture. This phenotype is recapitulated in wild-type ES cells treated with a KIT-neutralising antibody and reversed in mutant cells by activation of the hybrid KIT receptor. Differentiating KIT null ES cells exhibit elevated levels of DNA laddering and reduced BCL2 expression, indicative of apoptosis. We conclude that mouse ES cell differentiation in vitro is dependent on the SCF-KIT pathway contrasting with the apparently normal differentiation of KIT null inner cell mass or epiblast cells in vivo.

All three mutagens lead to a G=C --> A=T point mutation in the DNA molecule and the biochemical basis of these mutations in each case is the deamination of cytosine to uracil. It is shown that the lack of cytosine could be as mutagenic as the deamination of cytosine and it is shown schematically how cytosine lack could give rise to a population of genetically abnormal cells which are completely incapable of any degree of differentiation; a state perhaps reminiscent of the most acute of leukemias and the most anaplastic of cancers.

Antitumour responses are likely to be mediated by HLA class I- and II-restricted immune responses directed at tumour antigens. We assessed whether the peripheral blood of normal HLA-matched siblings of patients with melanoma could be used to generate lymphocytes with antimelanoma activity for adoptive immunotherapy after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation. Melanoma cell lines were derived from two donors and were used to stimulate the mononuclear cells of three HLA-identical siblings. CD4(+) clones dominated cultures. Of these, approximately half were directly cytotoxic towards recipient melanoma cells and secreted interferon-gamma in response to tumour stimulation. More than half of the noncytotoxic clones also secreted interferon-gamma after melanoma stimulation. No CD4(+) clones responded to stimulation with recipient haemopoietic cells. The majority of CD8(+) clones directly lysed recipient melanoma, but did not persist in long-term culture in vitro. No crossreactivity with recipient haemopoietic cells was observed. The antigenic target of one CD4(+) clone was determined to be an HLA-DR11-restricted MAGE-3 epitope. Antigenic targets of the remaining clones were not elucidated, but appeared to be restricted through a non-HLA-DR class II molecule. We conclude that the blood of allogeneic HLA-matched sibling donors contains melanoma-reactive lymphocyte precursors directed at tumour-associated antigens. Adoptive immunotherapy with unselected or ex vivo-stimulated donor lymphocytes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation has a rational basis for the treatment of malignant melanoma.","['Gottlieb, D J', 'Li, Y-C', 'Lionello, I', 'Tanzarella, S', 'Marangolo, M', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Russo, V', 'Traversari, C']","['Gottlieb DJ', 'Li YC', 'Lionello I', 'Tanzarella S', 'Marangolo M', 'Bradstock KF', 'Russo V', 'Traversari C']","['Leukaemia Research Laboratory, University of Sydney, Westmead Hospital, Sydney NSW 2145, Australia. david_gottlieb@wmi.usyd.edu.au']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/11/07 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['6603243 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6603243 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2006 Jul 17;95(2):181-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603243.

It was previously suggested that E2a/Pbx1 could cooperate with normal or oncogenic signaling pathways to immortalize myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells. To address this question, we introduced the receptor of the macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF-R) in pro-T cells immortalized by a conditional, estradiol-dependent, E2a/Pbx1-protein, and continuously proliferating in response to stem cell factor and interleukin-7. We asked whether M-CSF-R would be functional in an early T progenitor cell and influence the fate of E2a/Pbx1-immortalized cells. E2a-Pbx1 immortalized pro-T cells could proliferate and shifted from lymphoid to myeloid lineage after signaling through exogenously expressed M-CSF-R, irrespective of the presence of estradiol. However, terminal macrophage differentiation of the cells was obtained only when estradiol was withdrawn from cultures. This demonstrated that M-CSF-R is functional for proliferation and differentiation signaling in a T-lymphoid progenitor cell, which, in addition, unveiled myeloid potential of pro-T progenitors. Moreover, the block of differentiation induced by the E2a/Pbx1 oncogene could be modulated by hematopoietic cytokines such as M-CSF, suggesting plasticity of leukemic progenitor cells. Finally, additional experiments suggested that PU.1 and eight twenty-one transcriptional regulators might be implicated in the mechanisms of oncogenesis by E2a/Pbx1.","['Bourette, R P', 'Grasset, M-F', 'Mouchiroud, G']","['Bourette RP', 'Grasset MF', 'Mouchiroud G']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR CNRS 5534, Villeurbanne Cedex, France. bourette@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, fms/genetics/physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2006/07/05 09:00,2007/02/09 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209777 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209777 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jan 11;26(2):234-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209777.

To determine the frequency and severity of steroid myopathy and other steroid related complications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed grade >or=2 aGVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), we performed a retrospective analysis. Patients were included in the analysis if they had a diagnosis of AML/MDS, underwent an allogeneic HSCT between January 1996 and December 2001 and developed grade >or=2 aGVHD that was treated with 2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone and survived at least 100 days post transplant. A total of 70 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Steroid myopathy was identified in 29 (41%) patients. Steroid myopathy was generally of moderate severity with severe debilitating steroid myopathy seen in only 3% of patients.

The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.","['Fu, Zhichao', 'Huang, Dingde', 'Cai, Jianming', 'Chen, Qi', 'Han, Ling', 'Li, Bailong', 'Wang, Fengmei', 'Gao, Jianguo']","['Fu Z', 'Huang D', 'Cai J', 'Chen Q', 'Han L', 'Li B', 'Wang F', 'Gao J']","['Department of Radiotherapy, General Hospital of Fuzhou Military Command, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/09/06 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/47.121 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.47.121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2006 Jun;47(2):121-30. doi: 10.1269/jrr.47.121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that Tyk2 is directly involved in IFN signaling for the induction and translocation of Daxx, which may result in growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B lymphocyte progenitors. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of how Daxx acts on growth suppression of B lymphocytes, we examined functions of a sumoylation-defective Daxx KA mutant (Daxx K630/631A), which substituted Lys 630 and Lys 631 to Ala. Importantly, Daxx KA localized in the cytoplasm, whereas wild-type Daxx localized in the nucleus. Murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 expressing Daxx KA revealed a resistance to the IFN-induced growth suppression. It is noteworthy that treatment with an exportin inhibitor, leptomycin B, resulted in nuclear localization of Daxx KA and recovery of the IFN-induced growth suppression in Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, Daxx KA decreased the binding potential to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and overexpression of PML recruited Daxx KA into PML oncogenic domains. Notably, a Daxx-small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion protein exhibited increased nuclear localization and ability to suppress cell growth in Ba/F3 cells. These results demonstrate that the IFN-induced growth suppression of B lymphocytes requires nuclear localization of Daxx through its sumoylation and proper interactions with PML.","['Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Ishida, Masato', 'Sugiyama, Kenji', 'Sekine, Yuichi', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Muromoto R', 'Ishida M', 'Sugiyama K', 'Sekine Y', 'Oritani K', 'Shimoda K', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-Ku, Kita 12 Nishi 6, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Alanine/genetics', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/2/1160 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.2.1160 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jul 15;177(2):1160-70. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.2.1160.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through its binding to activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166), CD6 is considered to play an important role in lymphocyte development and activation. Accordingly, CD6 associates with the TCR/CD3 complex and colocalizes with it at the center of the mature immunological synapse on T lymphocytes. Moreover, the CD6-ALCAM interaction has been shown to be critical for proper immunological synapse maturation and T cell proliferative responses. However, the precise biological effects of CD6 ligation and its signaling pathway are still not well understood. The present study shows that CD6 ligation with three different specific mAbs (161.8, SPV-L14.2, and MAE1-C10) induces time- and dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 on normal and leukemic human T cells. This effect was also observed upon CD6 ligation with a chimerical ALCAM protein (ALCAM-Fc). The C-terminal cytoplasmic region of CD6, as well as Src tyrosine kinases, was critical for CD6-induced ERK1/2 activation. Synergistic effects were observed upon coligation of the TCR/CD3 complex with CD6. The ligation of CD6 induced the transcriptional activation of reporter genes under the control of the c-Fos serum responsive element and AP-1. Accordingly, CD6-mediated activation of p38 and JNK was also observed. These findings indicate that the CD6-ALCAM interaction results in activation of the three MAPK cascades, likely influencing the dynamic balance that determines whether resting or activated lymphocytes survive or undergo apoptosis.","['Ibanez, Anna', 'Sarrias, Maria-Rosa', 'Farnos, Montserrat', 'Gimferrer, Idoia', 'Serra-Pages, Carles', 'Vives, Jordi', 'Lozano, Francisco']","['Ibanez A', 'Sarrias MR', 'Farnos M', 'Gimferrer I', 'Serra-Pages C', 'Vives J', 'Lozano F']","[""Servei d'Immunologia, Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Facultat de Medicina, Universitat de Barcelona, Villaroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule/metabolism/physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Enzyme Induction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/pathology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'src-Family Kinases/physiology']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/2/1152 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.2.1152 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jul 15;177(2):1152-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.2.1152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies are often present in polyQ aggregates, but their relation to pathogenesis is unclear. We show that expression of PML isoform IV leads to the formation of distinct nuclear bodies enriched in components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These bodies recruit soluble mutant ataxin-7 and promote its degradation by proteasome-dependent proteolysis, thus preventing the aggregate formation. Inversely, disruption of the endogenous nuclear bodies with cadmium increases the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of mutant ataxin-7, demonstrating their role in ataxin-7 turnover. Interestingly, beta-interferon treatment, which induces the expression of endogenous PML IV, prevents the accumulation of transiently expressed mutant ataxin-7 without affecting the level of the endogenous wild-type protein. Therefore, clastosomes represent a potential therapeutic target for preventing polyQ disorders.","['Janer, Alexandre', 'Martin, Elodie', 'Muriel, Marie-Paule', 'Latouche, Morwena', 'Fujigasaki, Hiroto', 'Ruberg, Merle', 'Brice, Alexis', 'Trottier, Yvon', 'Sittler, Annie']","['Janer A', 'Martin E', 'Muriel MP', 'Latouche M', 'Fujigasaki H', 'Ruberg M', 'Brice A', 'Trottier Y', 'Sittler A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U679, Neurologie et Therapeutique Experimentale, 75651 Paris Cedex 13, France. sittler@ccr.jussieu.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (ATXN7 protein, human)', '0 (Ataxin-7)', '0 (Atxn7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxin-7', 'COS Cells', 'Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiprotein Complexes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Peptides/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/08/29 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200511045 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200511045 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2006 Jul 3;174(1):65-76. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200511045.,,,,,PMC2064165,,,,,,,,,

The present study was conducted to determine the efficacy and cellular pharmacology during clinical trials of single-agent clofarabine in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Previously treated patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were eligible for this study. Clofarabine was infused over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Most patients received 3 or 4 mg/m2/d x 5 days, whereas the other two were treated with 15 mg/m2/d x 5 days. Clinical outcome and associated pharmacologic end points were assessed. RESULTS: Myelosuppression limited the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine to 3 mg/m2/d on this schedule. Cellular pharmacokinetic studies showed a median clofarabine triphosphate concentration in CLL lymphocytes of 1.5 micromol/L (range, 0.2-2.3 micromol/L; n = 9). In the majority of cases, >50% of the analogue triphosphate was present 24 hours after infusion, indicating prolonged retention of the triphosphate in CLL cells. Although cytoreduction was observed, no patients achieved a response. In vitro clofarabine incubation of leukemic lymphocytes from 29 CLL patients showed that clofarabine monophosphate accumulated to a higher concentration compared with the triphosphate. Nonetheless, the triphosphate increased in a dose-dependent fashion and upon successive clofarabine infusions, suggesting benefit from greater doses given at less frequent intervals. CONCLUSION: Levels of clofarabine triphosphate at higher doses and prolonged maintenance of clofarabine triphosphate in leukemic lymphocytes provide a rationale to treat CLL in a weekly clofarabine schedule.","['Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Bonate, Peter L', 'Du, Min', 'Nowak, Billie', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Bonate PL', 'Du M', 'Nowak B', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],"['CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Aged', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Clofarabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/13/4011 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2664 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 1;12(13):4011-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2664.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the early p53 protein and gene expression during induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Leukemic cells were collected from five AML patients during their first 18 hours of induction chemotherapy and examined for p53 protein and gene expression by one- and two-dimensional gel immunoblot and high-density gene expression arrays. RESULTS: Up-regulation of p53 protein expression was detected in AML patients posttreatment in vivo. One- and two-dimensional gel immunoblots showed two main forms of p53, denominated alpha p53 and delta p53, both recognized by various NH2-terminal directed antibodies. As a response to treatment, we detected rapid accumulation of alpha p53, with significantly altered protein expression levels already after 2 hours. The accumulation of alpha p53 was accompanied by increased transcription of putative p53 target genes and subsequent cytopenia in the patients. CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of the p53 protein and target genes seems to be a prominent feature in induction chemotherapy of AML. The rapid shift from a shorter p53 protein form (delta) toward the full-length protein (alpha) underscores the complexity of p53 protein modulation in patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['Anensen, Nina', 'Oyan, Anne Margrete', 'Bourdon, Jean-Christophe', 'Kalland, Karl Henning', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Anensen N', 'Oyan AM', 'Bourdon JC', 'Kalland KH', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Hematology Section, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2006/07/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/13/3985 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1970 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 1;12(13):3985-92. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1970.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have assessed the significance of plasma DNA mutations for subsequent cancer development in healthy subjects in a large longitudinal prospective study. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was analyzed with a nested case-control design.

Controls were matched 2:1 for follow-up, age, sex, area of recruitment, and smoking status. KRAS2 mutations were detected by mutant-enriched PCR and sequencing (n = 1,098). TP53 mutations were detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis, and sequencing (n = 550). KRAS2 or TP53 mutations were detected in 13 of 1,098 (1.2%) and 20 of 550 (3.6%) subjects, respectively, 16 of whom developed cancer on average after 18.3 months of follow-up.

However, use of primary tumor cells, including chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cells, has shown inherent resistance to TRAIL. Although the molecular basis for this resistance remains unknown, treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) often sensitizes resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We used structurally diverse HDACi to ascertain which HDAC needs to be inhibited for the sensitization. Inhibition of HDAC class I but not class II is required for sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis of CLL cells and various cell lines. Using different HDACi together with small interfering RNA for HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6, we report that inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 but not HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 are primarily responsible for sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Based on these data and our previous studies, we propose that a clinical trial in CLL is warranted using a combination of a selective HDACi that inhibits HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 together with a form of TRAIL that signals through TRAIL receptor 1.","['Inoue, Satoshi', 'Mai, Antonello', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Inoue S', 'Mai A', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['MC_U132615750/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylase 2', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/09/08 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/13/6785 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4563 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 1;66(13):6785-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we provide evidence that the kinases MAPK kinase 3 (Mkk3) and Mkk6 are activated during treatment of leukemic cell lines with As(2)O(3) to regulate downstream engagement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Using cells with targeted disruption of both the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes, we show that As(2)O(3)-dependent activation of p38 is defective in the absence of Mkk3 and Mkk6, establishing that these kinases are essential for As(2)O(3)-dependent engagement of the p38 pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 enhances As(2)O(3)-dependent activation of the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and subsequent induction of apoptosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)- or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cell lines. In addition, in APL blasts, inhibition of p38 enhances myeloid cell differentiation in response to As(2)O(3), as well as suppression of Bcl-2 expression and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Similarly, induction of As(2)O(3)-dependent apoptosis is enhanced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with targeted disruption of both the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes, establishing a key role for this pathway in the regulation of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. In other studies, we show that the small-molecule p38 inhibitors SD-282 and SCIO-469 potentiate As(2)O(3)-mediated suppression of myeloid leukemic progenitor growth from CML patients, indicating a critical regulatory role for p38 in the induction of antileukemic responses. Altogether, our data indicate that the Mkk3/6-p38 signaling cascade is activated in a negative regulatory feedback manner to control induction of As(2)O(3)-mediated antileukemic effects.","['Giafis, Nick', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Higgins, Linda S', 'Nebreda, Angel R', 'Davis, Roger J', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Giafis N', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Sassano A', 'Tallman MS', 'Higgins LS', 'Nebreda AR', 'Davis RJ', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

We examined its effect on differentiation, proliferation, and gene expression in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays in semisolid medium combined with morphologic examination and flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed that NUP98-HOXA9 increased the numbers of erythroid precursors and impaired both myeloid and erythroid differentiation. In continuous liquid culture, cells transduced with NUP98-HOXA9 exhibited a biphasic growth curve with initial growth inhibition followed by enhanced long-term proliferation, suggesting an increase in the numbers of primitive self-renewing cells. This was confirmed by a dramatic increase in the numbers of long-term culture-initiating cells, the most primitive hematopoietic cells detectable in vitro. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was done at several time points over 16 days, starting at 6 hours posttransduction. The early growth suppression was preceded by up-regulation of IFNbeta1 and accompanied by marked up-regulation of IFN-induced genes, peaking at 3 days posttransduction. In contrast, oncogenes such as homeobox transcription factors, FLT3, KIT, and WT1 peaked at 8 days or beyond, coinciding with increased proliferation. In addition, several putative tumor suppressors and genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were repressed at later time points. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the changes in proliferation, differentiation, and global gene expression that underlie the leukemic transformation of human hematopoietic cells by NUP98-HOXA9.","['Takeda, Akiko', 'Goolsby, Charles', 'Yaseen, Nabeel R']","['Takeda A', 'Goolsby C', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 HL 82549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/09/08 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/13/6628 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0458 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jul 1;66(13):6628-37. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0458.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several recent studies showed the apoptotic effect of perifosine alone or in combination with other anticancer agents. However, this is the first study describing the effects of combining perifosine with the commonly used chemotherapy drug etoposide in cultured human Jurkat T-leukemia cells. Low concentrations of perifosine (5 micromol/L) induced cell death in a synergistic fashion with etoposide if used simultaneously or immediately following exposure to etoposide (posttreatment). The increase in cell death seems to be due to an inactivation of the Akt survival pathway, where treated cells showed a complete dephosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, combined drug-induced Akt deactivation was associated with a parallel decrease in phosphorylation of FoxO1 transcription factor and in expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL. Furthermore, the increase in cell death was associated with a specific activation of the caspase-dependent Fas death receptor pathway. These findings might be useful when designing clinical trials where chemotherapy is combined with perifosine for a potential broad use against hematologic malignancies in which the Akt survival pathway is frequently activated.","['Nyakern, Maria', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Mantovani, Irina', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Nyakern M', 'Cappellini A', 'Mantovani I', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Universita di Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/6/1559 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0076 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Jun;5(6):1559-70. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0076.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CDDO-Im induces monocytic differentiation markers, CD14, and nonspecific esterase in HL60 leukemia cells. We show that CDDO-Im activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and up-regulates CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, a transcription factor critical for monocytic differentiation. The monocytic differentiation induced by CDDO-Im was partially blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that the mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK1/2 pathway plays a role in the differentiation induced by CDDO-Im. Furthermore, CDDO-Im activates the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling pathway. CDDO-Im enhanced the phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads, phospho-Smad3, and phospho-Smad1/5, but not phospho-Smad2, and induced the expression of Smad4. Monocytic differentiation induced by CDDO-Im was blocked by both TGF-beta antibody and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Noggin. This indicates that activation of the Smad signaling pathway by triterpenoids is an important mechanism of monocytic differentiation. CDDO-Im induced the synthesis of mRNA for TGF-beta2, BMP6, TGF-beta type II receptor, and BMP type II receptor. CDDO-Im synergized with members of the TGF-beta superfamily or with 1alpha,25(OH)2vitamin D3 (D3) in monocytic differentiation, and the synergistic effect was particularly striking in combination with D3. The combination of triterpenoids and D3 may have a practical use in differentiation therapy of myeloid leukemia as well as for promoting the formation of bone and cartilage.","['Ji, Yan', 'Lee, Hong Jin', 'Goodman, Catherine', 'Uskokovic, Milan', 'Liby, Karen', 'Sporn, Michael', 'Suh, Nanjoo']","['Ji Y', 'Lee HJ', 'Goodman C', 'Uskokovic M', 'Liby K', 'Sporn M', 'Suh N']","['Department of Chemical Biology, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 164 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K22 CA 99990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA112642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (1-(2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oyl) imidazole)', '0 (BMP6 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (TGFB2 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta2)', '148294-77-3 (noggin protein)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smad Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/6/1452 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0136 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Jun;5(6):1452-8. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0136.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blasts invade the bloodstream and may localize in extramedullar sites, with variations from one patient to another. We hypothesized that a polymorphism in the SDF-1 coding gene (CXCL12 G801A) could influence blast dissemination and tissue infiltration in AML. CXCL12 G801A polymorphism was determined in 86 adult patients and 100 healthy volunteers. The allelic status and CXCR4 expression on bone marrow blasts were analyzed in relation to peripheral blood blast (PBB) counts and frequency of extramedullar tumor sites. 801A carrier status (801G/A, 801A/A) was found to be associated with a higher PBB count compared with 801G/G homozygous patients (P=0.031) and higher frequency of extramedullar tumor sites (odds ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.18-7.21, P=0.018). Moreover, the PBB count was correlated with CXCR4 expression (correlation coefficient 0.546, P=0.001) when considering 801A carriers. In conclusion, a polymorphism in the SDF-1 gene is shown for the first time to be associated with the clinical presentation of a malignant hematological disease and more generally with the risk of distant tissue infiltration by tumor cells.","['Dommange, Florence', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Espanel, Claire', 'Gallay, Nathalie', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Benboubker, Lotfi', 'Ohresser, Marc', 'Colombat, Philippe', 'Binet, Chistian', 'Watier, Herve', 'Herault, Olivier']","['Dommange F', 'Cartron G', 'Espanel C', 'Gallay N', 'Domenech J', 'Benboubker L', 'Ohresser M', 'Colombat P', 'Binet C', 'Watier H', 'Herault O']","[""CHRU de Tours, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Service d;Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire.""]",['GOELAMS Study Group'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics/*pathology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/09/19 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.05-5667fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.05-5667fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2006 Sep;20(11):1913-5. doi: 10.1096/fj.05-5667fje.

Incorporation of Ara-C into DNA is a key event in the mechanism of killing of proliferating leukemic cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Ara-C was cytotoxic to proliferating but not to resting (G(O)) malignant cells from patients with acute leukemia. In contrast, here we show unexpected apoptosis of G(O) B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells by Ara-C in a dose-dependent manner. In this study we analyzed which cellular processes were involved in Ara-C-mediated killing of G(O)-B-CLL cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using primary B-CLL cells (>98% in G(O)), we examined the mechanisms of Ara-C-mediated apoptosis in resting G(O) cells. CFSE-based cytotoxicity assays combined with cell cycle analysis were used to perform a long-term analysis of Ara-C-mediated killing of B-CLL cells. The effects of Ara-C on DNA and RNA synthesis were studied using various 3H-incorporation experiments. RESULTS: Ara-C-mediated cell death of B-CLL cells showed the characteristics of normal apoptosis, such as phosphatidyl serine exposure and caspase activation. The mechanism of killing of quiescent B-CLL cells by Ara-C was shown not to be dependent on DNA replication. In contrast, CD40L-activated B-CLL cells showed S-phase-specific depletion of proliferating CLL cells. We demonstrated that Ara-C was converted into its active triphosphate by G(O)-B-CLL cells, coinciding with a 30% inhibition of RNA synthesis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data indicate that Ara-C can induce apoptosis in resting G(O)-B-CLL cells using a mechanism independent of cell proliferation and DNA replication but associated with inhibition of RNA synthesis and downregulation of Mcl-1.","['de Vries, Jeltje F', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Barge, Renee M Y']","['de Vries JF', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Willemze R', 'Barge RM']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

It has been proposed that aberrant targeting of the somatic hypermutation machinery is instrumental in initiation and progression of B-cell non Hodgkin's lymphomas. In this study, we investigated the B-cell receptor and the role of the somatic hypermutation machinery in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL) prior to and after transformation to a lymphoma of a higher malignancy grade (Richter's transformation). DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the activity of the somatic hypermutation machinery in nine B-CLL and secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas by measuring the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, in combination with mutation analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) and non-Ig genes. Furthermore, the structure of the antigen receptors of B-CLL known to have developed a Richter's syndrome (RS B-CLL) was analyzed by comparing the most variable region of the Ig, the CDR3 region, to CDR3 sequences present in GenBank. RESULTS: Ig variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene studies revealed that Richter's transformation occurs almost exclusively in unmutated B-CLL. Furthermore, activated-induced cytidine deaminase expression and somatic hypermutation activity of most RS B-CLL were found to be higher than those of control (non-transforming) B-CLL. Finally, comparison of the IgVH-CDR3 regions showed a remarkable amino acid sequence homology between two RS B-CLL of our panel and two RS B-CLL described in the literature.

Two gene families (SLC28 and SLC29) encode the two types of human nucleoside transporters, concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) proteins. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express both SLC28- and SLC29-related mRNA, although transport function seems to be mostly related to ENT-type transporters. Here we have analyzed the role of nucleoside transporters in nucleoside-derived drug bioavailability and action in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: The relative amounts of hENT1 and hENT2-related mRNA and protein were analyzed in five MCL cell lines and 20 primary MCL tumors by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blots. Cell viability, measured by annexin V-FITC staining, and nucleoside-derived drug transport were also studied. RESULTS: MCL cells express higher levels of hENT1 protein than do CLL cells, and a good correlation was found between protein and mRNA levels of hENT1, thus indirectly suggesting that hENT1 might be transcriptionally regulated in MCL cells. More importantly, a significant correlation between these two parameters, drug uptake and sensitivity to gemcitabine, was also observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results further support the concept that nucleoside transporters are implicated in the therapeutic response to nucleoside analogs, and suggest a particular and novel role for hENT1 in the genotoxic response to selected nucleoside analogs, such as gemcitabine, in MCL cells.","['Marce, Silvia', 'Molina-Arcas, Miriam', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Casado, F Javier', 'Campo, Elias', 'Pastor-Anglada, Marcal', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Marce S', 'Molina-Arcas M', 'Villamor N', 'Casado FJ', 'Campo E', 'Pastor-Anglada M', 'Colomer D']","[""Unitat d'Hematopatologia, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Villarroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nucleosides/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/07/22 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jul;91(7):895-902.,,,,['Haematologica. 2006 Jul;91(7):866B.

Results of the EORTC studies 58881 and 58951.",881-5,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deletion and methylation of the 9p21 chromosomal region are frequent in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but the prognostic significance is controversial. They inactivate CDKN2A, a gene encoding both p16INKa and p14ARF and, in some cases, contiguous genes that may influence chemosensitivity, such as CDKN2B encoding p15INKb or MTAP encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase. DESIGN AND METHODS: CDKN2A inactivation by deletion or methylation was studied using gene dosage and methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Bi-allelic and mono-allelic inactivation were found in, respectively, 38 (17%) and 31 (14%) of 227 children with B-lineage ALL enrolled in EORTC trials. Although CDKN2A inactivation was more often associated with poor prognostic features in B-lineage ALL, it failed to influence the outcome of the patients significantly. Bi-allelic CDKN2B and MTAP co-inactivation were found in 36 (16%) and 24 (11%) of patients, respectively, and did not influence the 6-year event-free survival rate either, even when the analysis was restricted to CDKN2A inactivated ALL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this study of 227 cases of childhood B-lineage ALL, inactivation of CDKN2A, CDKN2B and MTAP did not influences the patients' outcome.","['Mirebeau, Delphine', 'Acquaviva, Cecile', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Bertin, Raphaelle', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Robert, Alain', 'Boutard, Patrick', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Plouvier, Emmanuel', 'Otten, Jacques', 'Vilmer, Etienne', 'Cave, Helene']","['Mirebeau D', 'Acquaviva C', 'Suciu S', 'Bertin R', 'Dastugue N', 'Robert A', 'Boutard P', 'Mechinaud F', 'Plouvier E', 'Otten J', 'Vilmer E', 'Cave H']","['AP-HP, Paris, France.']",['EORTC-CLG'],['eng'],"['2U10CA11488-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10CA11488-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/07/22 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jul;91(7):881-5.,,,,['Haematologica. 2006 Jul;91(7):865B.

Although extensive studies have been carried out to assess the molecular features of NCI60 cell lines related to cancer and their sensitivities to more than 100,000 chemical compounds, it remains unclear if and how well these cell lines represent or model their tumor tissues of origin. Identification and confirmation of correct origins of NCI60 cell lines are critical to their usage as model systems and to translate in vitro studies into clinical potentials. Here we report a direct comparison between NCI60 cell lines and primary tumors by analyzing global gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Comparative analysis suggested that 51 of 59 cell lines we analyzed represent their presumed tumors of origin. Taking advantage of available clinical information of primary tumor samples used to generate gene expression profiling data, we further classified those cell lines with the correct origins into different subtypes of cancer or different stages in cancer development. For example, 6 of 7 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were classified as lung adenocarcinomas and all of them were classified into late stages in tumor progression. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we developed and applied a novel approach for systematic comparative analysis and integrative classification of NCI60 cell lines and primary tumors. Our results could provide guidance to the selection of appropriate cell lines for cancer research and pharmaceutical compound screenings. Moreover, this gene expression profile based approach can be generally applied to evaluate experimental model systems such as cell lines and animal models for human diseases.","['Wang, Huixia', 'Huang, Shuguang', 'Shou, Jianyong', 'Su, Eric W', 'Onyia, Jude E', 'Liao, Birong', 'Li, Shuyu']","['Wang H', 'Huang S', 'Shou J', 'Su EW', 'Onyia JE', 'Liao B', 'Li S']","['Integrative Biology, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA. huixia@gmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/classification/*genetics', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/classification/*genetics']",2006/07/05 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-7-166 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-7-166 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2006 Jul 3;7:166. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-7-166.,,20060703,,,PMC1525183,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been consistently used as a trusted classification tool for this type of analysis. In this study, a new Artificial Neural Network approach is proposed for the multidimensional classification of two of the most common forms of leukemia: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), also sometimes called Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. Beckman-Coulter Corporation supplied flow cytometry data of 120 patients that were used in the training and testing phases. The ANN algorithm was thus developed to exploit the different features of the different blood cells provided in an optimized fashion. The goal was to establish a programming tool, supported through this new ANN development, for the identification of normal and abnormal blood samples and provide information to medical doctors in the form of diagnostic references for the specific disease state that is considered for this study. The application of the ANN algorithm produced remarkable classification accuracy results that show a 95% classification accuracy for the normal blood samples and 90% classification accuracy for the abnormal samples even under the ubiquitous problem of overlap.","['Zong, Nuannuan', 'Adjouadi, Malek', 'Ayala, Melvin']","['Zong N', 'Adjouadi M', 'Ayala M']","['Department of Electrical and Computer, Florida International University, 10555 W.

METHODS: The data of 151 consecutive HCL patients observed between 1982 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The following data at presentation were analyzed and compared to response, DFS, PFS and OS: Hb < 10 g/dl (observed in 27% of patients); Plt < 100,000/microl (72%); WBC > 10,000/microl (15%); Splenomegaly (75%); Bone marrow involvement > 70% (27%). At univariate analysis only WBC > 10,000/microl resulted significantly correlated to reduced PFS. 88 Pts received as first line treatment alpha2-interferon (IFN) alone, 49 purine analogues (PA) alone or in combination with IFN, 5 were treated with splenectomy. Among IFN treated patients CR, PR and SD were obtained in 21.6%, 73.8%, 4.5% respectively of the patients; while among PA treated patients in: 26.5%, 71.4%, 2.0% respectively.

The aim of our study was to detect nutritional parameters, which could have an influence on length of stay in hospitalized patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with a nutritional evaluation at hospital admission were elegible for inclusion. A total of 1,088 patients were studied from January 1999 to December 2003. Length of stay (LOS) data was obtained from the patient hospital record after the patient was discharged. All patients received instruction in 24-hour written food record keeping. Albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, glucose levels and total lymphocytes, were measured in all patients. Weight, body mass index, tricipital skinfold, midarm muscle circumference and midarm muscle area were assessed in a standard way. Weight loss in the previous 3 months was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1,088 patients were enrolled, mean age 61.8 +/- 17 years, weight 64.2 +/- 15 kg and BMI 23.9 +/- 4.6, with a weight loss 4.15 +/- 9.6 kg. The sex distribution of patients was 65.2% male and 34.8% females. Distribution of diagnosis showed leukemia and lymphoma (11.5%), solid cancer (37.4%), infections (3.5%), neurological disease (13.6%), respiratory tract disease (8.8%), and miscellaneous group (25.3%). Length of stay was 29.45 +/- 25.13 days. In whole group, the correlation analysis among length of stay (days) and predictive parameters showed a positive association between albumin and length of stay (r = -0.2; p < 0.05). In the multivariant analysis with a dependent variable (length of stay (days)) and independent variables with an association in univariant analysis adjusted by age and sex, only albumin remained as an independent predictor in the model (F = 8.8; p < 0.05), with an increase of 6.2 days (95% CI: 3.5-8.9) with each decrease of 1 g/dl of albumin. CONCLUSION: The serum albumin levels are a good marker of LOS, a decrease in admission levels produces an increase in LOS.","['de Luis, Daniel A', 'Izaola, Olatz', 'Cuellar, Luis', 'Terroba, M Concepcion', 'Cabezas, Gloria', 'Rojo, S', 'Aller, Rocio', 'Sagrado, M Gonzalez']","['de Luis DA', 'Izaola O', 'Cuellar L', 'Terroba MC', 'Cabezas G', 'Rojo S', 'Aller R', 'Sagrado MG']","['Institute of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Medicine School and Unit of Investigation, Hospital Rio Hortega, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain. dadluis@yahoo.es']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Ann Nutr Metab,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,8105511,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Serum Albumin)']",IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Diet Records', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Status', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum Albumin/*analysis']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['94362 [pii]', '10.1159/000094362 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Nutr Metab. 2006;50(4):394-8. doi: 10.1159/000094362.

Among the rat strains infected with HTLV-1, chronic progressive myelopathy, named HAM rat disease, occurs exclusively in WKAH rats. In the present study, we found that HTLV-1 infection induces interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the spinal cords of HAM-resistant strains but not in those of WKAH rats. Neurons were the major cells that produced IFN-gamma in HTLV-1-infected, HAM-resistant strains. Administration of IFN-gamma suppressed expression of pX, the gene critically involved in the onset of HAM rat disease, in an HTLV-1-immortalized rat T-cell line, indicating that IFN-gamma protects against the development of HAM rat disease. The inability of WKAH spinal cord neurons to produce IFN-gamma after infection appeared to stem from defects in signaling through the interleukin (IL)-12 receptor. Specifically, WKAH-derived spinal cord cells were unable to up-regulate the IL-12 receptor beta2 gene in response to IL-12 stimulation. We suggest that the failure of spinal cord neurons to produce IFN-gamma through the IL-12 pathway is involved in the development of HAM rat disease.","['Miyatake, Yukiko', 'Ikeda, Hitoshi', 'Ishizu, Akihiro', 'Baba, Tomohisa', 'Ichihashi, Toru', 'Suzuki, Akira', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Kasahara, Masanori', 'Yoshiki, Takashi']","['Miyatake Y', 'Ikeda H', 'Ishizu A', 'Baba T', 'Ichihashi T', 'Suzuki A', 'Tomaru U', 'Kasahara M', 'Yoshiki T']","['Department of Pathology/Pathophysiology, Division of Pathophysiological Science, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (IL12RB2 protein, human)', '0 (Il12rb2 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spinal Cord/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)61442-3 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2006.051225 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2006 Jul;169(1):189-99. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2006.051225.,,,,,PMC1698768,"['GENBANK/DQ399740', 'GENBANK/DQ399741', 'GENBANK/DQ399742']",,,,,,,,

Interestingly, l-asparaginase treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients causes severe deficiency in the serpin antithrombin. We studied the consequences of this drug on antithrombin levels, activity, conformation, and immunohistological and ultrastructural features in plasma from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, HepG2 cells, and plasma and livers from mice treated with this drug. Additionally, we evaluated intracellular deposition of alpha1-antitrypsin. l-Asparaginase did not affect functional or conformational parameters of mature antithrombin; however, patients and mice displayed severe type I deficiency with no abnormal conformations of circulating antithrombin. Moreover, l-asparaginase impaired secretion of antithrombin by HepG2 cells. These effects were explained by the intracellular retention of antithrombin, forming aggregates within dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisterns. Similar effects were observed for alpha1-antitrypsin in plasma, cells, and livers, and intracellular aggregates of additional proteins were observed in frontal cortex and pancreas. This is the first report of a conformational drug-associated effect on serpins without genetic factors involved. l-Asparaginase treatment induces severe, acquired, and transient type I deficiency of antithrombin (and alpha1-antitrypsin) with intracellular accumulation of the nascent molecule, increasing the risk of thrombosis.","['Hernandez-Espinosa, David', 'Minano, Antonia', 'Martinez, Constantino', 'Perez-Ceballos, Elena', 'Heras, Inmaculada', 'Fuster, Jose L', 'Vicente, Vicente', 'Corral, Javier']","['Hernandez-Espinosa D', 'Minano A', 'Martinez C', 'Perez-Ceballos E', 'Heras I', 'Fuster JL', 'Vicente V', 'Corral J']","['Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia 30003, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Factor Xa/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibrin/*chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/chemistry/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein Conformation', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/drug effects/metabolism']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)61438-1 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2006.051238 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2006 Jul;169(1):142-53. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2006.051238.,,,,,PMC1698772,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Serologic investigations revealed a markedly elevated copper (hypercupremia) and IgG levels with a normal ceruloplasmin. Wilson's disease was excluded as a possible cause based on liver function tests and a liver biopsy.

General conditions and overall conclusions of the study.,13-36,"This study, coordinated by the SFTG (French branch of European Environmental Mutagen Society), included 38 participants from Europe, Japan and America. Clastogens (bleomycin, urethane), including base and nucleoside analogs (5-fluorouracil and cytosine arabinoside), aneugens and/or polyploidy inducers (colchicine, diethylstilboestrol, griseofulvin and thiabendazole), as well as non-genotoxic compounds (mannitol and clofibrate), were tested. Four cell types were used, i.e. human lymphocytes in the presence of cytochalasin B and CHO, CHL and L5178Y cell lines, in the presence or absence of cytochalasin B, with various treatment-recovery schedules. Mitomycin C was used as a positive control for all cell types. Mannitol and clofibrate were consistently negative in all cell types and with all treatment-recovery conditions. Urethane, known to induce questionable clastogenicity, was not found as positive. Bleomycin and mitomycin C were found positive in all treatment-recovery conditions. The base and nucleoside analogs were less easy to detect, especially 5-fluorouracil due to the interference with cytotoxicity, while cytosine arabinoside was detected in all cell types depending on the treatment-recovery schedule. Aneugens (colchicine, diethylstilboestrol and griseofulvin) were all detected in all cell types. In this study, the optimal detection was ensured when a short treatment followed by a long recovery was associated with a long continuous treatment without recovery. There was no impact of the presence or absence of cytochalasin B on the detection of micronucleated cells on cell lines. Scoring micronucleated cells in both mononucleated and binucleated cells when using cytochalasin B was confirmed to be useful for the detection and the identification of aneugens. In conclusion, these results, together with previously published validation studies, provide a useful contribution to the optimisation of a study protocol for the detection of both clastogens and aneugens in the in vitro micronucleus test.","['Lorge, Elisabeth', 'Thybaud, Veronique', 'Aardema, Marilyn J', 'Oliver, Jo', 'Wakata, Akihiro', 'Lorenzon, Giocondo', 'Marzin, Daniel']","['Lorge E', 'Thybaud V', 'Aardema MJ', 'Oliver J', 'Wakata A', 'Lorenzon G', 'Marzin D']","['Servier Group, Drug Safety Assessment, Orleans-Gidy, France. elisabeth.lorge@fr.netgrs.com']",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Aneugens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '32HRV3E3D5 (Griseofulvin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)', 'HPN91K7FU3 (Clofibrate)', 'N1Q45E87DT (Thiabendazole)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aneugens/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Bleomycin/toxicity', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Clofibrate/toxicity', 'Colchicine/toxicity', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Cytochalasin B', 'Diethylstilbestrol/toxicity', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Griseofulvin/toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mannitol/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests/*methods/standards', 'Mitomycin/toxicity', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Thiabendazole/toxicity']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(06)00084-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Aug 4;607(1):13-36. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.04.006.

These ITAM-bearing viral proteins have been implicated in cellular transformation in virus-infected hematopoietic cells, typically B cells, but also in non-hematopoietic tissues--including endothelial and epithelial cells.","['Lanier, Lewis L']",['Lanier LL'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Cancer Research Institute, University of California-San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, HSE 1001G, San Francisco, CA 94143-00414, USA. lewis.lanier@ucsf.edu']",,['eng'],"['AI 066897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 068129/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 095137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Trends Cell Biol,Trends in cell biology,9200566,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (K1 protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tyrosine/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/physiology']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0962-8924(06)00149-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tcb.2006.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Cell Biol. 2006 Aug;16(8):388-90. doi: 10.1016/j.tcb.2006.06.004.

Here we report on the construction, characterization, and utilization of retroviral vectors encoding barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, expression of which results in apoptosis of transduced mammalian cells. High-titer viral vector production was enabled by expression of an inhibitor of barnase (barstar) in transfected cells generating murine leukemia virus (MLV)- and HIV-1-based vectors. To identify cellular genes required for infection we used barnase-encoding vectors in a genetic screen to isolate mutant mammalian cells that are resistant to infection by MLV and HIV-1. We describe one such mutant clone that is inhibited in the infection process after reverse transcription. These results suggest that barnase-encoding vectors should be useful for negative selection strategies examining retroviral infection from entry to integration. Furthermore these vectors could have utility in approaches for gene therapy that require specific cell ablation.","['Agarwal, Sumit', 'Nikolai, Bryan', 'Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki', 'Lech, Patrycja', 'Somia, Nikunj V']","['Agarwal S', 'Nikolai B', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Lech P', 'Somia NV']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE, MMC 206, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",,['eng'],['R21 AI 60470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cricetinae', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Ribonucleases/biosynthesis/*genetics/*toxicity', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/10/21 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(06)00178-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.03.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2006 Oct;14(4):555-63. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2006.03.025.

Here, we investigate the effects of arsenic exposure on the induction of the growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45 alpha (GADD45 alpha), which is thought to play roles in apoptosis, DNA damage response, and cell cycle arrest. We found that arsenic transcriptionally activates the gadd45 alpha promoter located in a 153-bp region between -234 and -81, relative to the transcriptional start site. In addition, this transcriptional induction was abrogated in the presence of H2O2 scavengers, suggesting a role for H2O2 in the transcriptional control of the gadd45a gene through a Fenton-like free radical mechanism.","['Bower, Jacquelyn J', 'Leonard, Stephen S', 'Chen, Fei', 'Shi, Xianglin']","['Bower JJ', 'Leonard SS', 'Chen F', 'Shi X']","['Pathology and Physiology Research Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(06)00250-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2006 Jul 15;41(2):285-94. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.007.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 697 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations at our institution from 1991 to 2004. In 24 patients (3.5%) an underlying comorbidity directly affecting the immune system was diagnosed before bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration or steroids were administered at least 6 weeks before and at the time of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. The immunosuppressive effect of steroids was assessed by the percent of lymphocytes. End points were the bacillus Calmette-Guerin response at 6 months, defined as normal cystoscopy, cytology and biopsy when available, and treatment related toxicity. RESULTS: Four patients (17%) had active lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia during bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration and 21 (88%) had a concurrent condition for which oral steroids (11), inhaled steroids (14) or oral and inhaled steroids (4) were administered. Patients treated with oral steroids had a lower percent of lymphocytes than patients treated with inhaled steroids and 15 age matched patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and no steroid treatment (12.3% vs 17.5% and 18.6%, respectively). The overall bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months was 58%. Ten of the 24 patients had disease recurrence and 3 had disease progression at a median followup of 63.5 months (IQR 19.5, 89). One patient treated with oral steroids had self-limited febrile disease and worsening of myalgia 48 hours after his third bacillus Calmette-Guerin cycle. No other systemic adverse event following bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was recorded and all patients completed scheduled treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin is a viable therapeutic option in patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and concomitant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with low dose oral steroids or treatment with inhaled steroids. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate at 6 months and the side effects profile associated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in these patients were comparable to those in patients with no evidence of immunosuppression. Further studies are warranted to assess the safety and efficacy of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations in critically immunocompromised patients.","['Yossepowitch, Ofer', 'Eggener, Scott E', 'Bochner, Bernard H', 'Donat, S Machele', 'Herr, Harry W', 'Dalbagni, Guido']","['Yossepowitch O', 'Eggener SE', 'Bochner BH', 'Donat SM', 'Herr HW', 'Dalbagni G']","['Department of Urology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Administration, Intravesical', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'BCG Vaccine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carcinoma in Situ/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Steroids/*therapeutic use', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/08/30 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5347(06)00825-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2006.03.066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2006 Aug;176(2):482-5. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2006.03.066.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that primary cells would be more apt to respond to high potencies than cell lines, especially cancer cell lines. We set out to investigate the effects of low doses and high homeopathic potencies of cadmium chloride, respectively, in an intoxication model with human primary lymphocytes compared to a human leukemia cell line (Jurkat). DESIGN: Cells were pretreated with either low concentrations (nM-microM) or high potencies (pool 15-20c) of cadmium for 120 hours, following which they were exposed to a toxic treatment with a range of cadmium concentrations (8-80 microM) during 24 hours. Cell viability was eventually assessed by use of the MTS/PES assay. Controls included a vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) for the low concentrations of cadmium or water 15-20c for cadmium 15-20c. A total of 34 experiments were conducted, 23 with low concentrations and 11 with high potencies of cadmium. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Pretreatment with low concentrations or high potencies of cadmium significantly increased cell viability in primary lymphocytes after toxic challenge, compared to control cells (mean effect +/- standard error = 19% +/- 0.9% for low concentrations respectively 8% +/- 0.6% for high potencies of cadmium; p < 0.001 in both cases). The pretreatment effect of low doses was significant also in cancerous lymphocytes (4% +/- 0.5%; p < 0.001), albeit weaker than in normal lymphocytes. However, high homeopathic potencies had no effect on cancerous lymphocytes (1% +/- 1.9%; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: High homeopathic potencies exhibit a biologic effect on cell cultures of normal primary lymphocytes. Cancerous lymphocytes (Jurkat), having lost the ability to respond to regulatory signals, seem to be fairly unresponsive to high homeopathic potencies.","['Walchli, Chantal', 'Baumgartner, Stephan', 'Bastide, Madeleine']","['Walchli C', 'Baumgartner S', 'Bastide M']","['Institute for Complementary Medicine (KIKOM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. waelchli@hiscia.ch']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Altern Complement Med,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",9508124,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Cadmium Chloride/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Homeopathy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",2006/07/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/acm.2006.12.421 [doi]'],ppublish,J Altern Complement Med. 2006 Jun;12(5):421-7. doi: 10.1089/acm.2006.12.421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is emphasized that important physiologic and pathogenic components of the illness relate not only to the erythroid cell, but also to the megakaryocyte. Both play essential roles in causing complications of the disease. Hematologists agree that the mainstay in treatment remains phlebotomy, a basic pillar of the concept of PRIMUM NON NOCERE. In general, the target levels for the hematocrit have been accepted as <or= 45% for men and <or= 42% for women. Low-dose aspirin, 80 to 100 mg daily, should be used as a basic component of therapy. The selection of the type of treatment for those patients who require some form of myelosuppression owing to the frequency of phlebotomy and/or its complications provides the basis for major discussion, confrontation, and disagreement. For the most part, alkylating agents are avoided owing to the established risk of secondary leukemia, but these drugs and radioactive phosphorous ( (32)P) still play a role in treating the very elderly patient or for those who have significant comorbid conditions. Whereas hydroxyurea remains the most frequently prescribed drug, limitations to its use as a therapeutic agent of choice include questions regarding its effectiveness, toxicity, and potential leukemogenicity. Interferon offers a rational choice of treatment owing to its broad physiologic effects on hematopoiesis. Whereas its effect in treating patients with PV is unequivocal, it is associated with side effects even when used properly. Moreover, it has only modest effect on Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) expression. Clearly, the best treatment for patients with PV is still sought. Perhaps more explicit exploitation of the JAK2 abnormality found in PV (and other myeloproliferative diseases) may provide more effective agents in the future.","['Silver, Richard T']",['Silver RT'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York 10021-4873, USA. rsilve@med.cornell.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Phlebotomy', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/26 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-942765 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2006 Jun;32(4 Pt 2):437-42. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-942765.,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the response rates of IFN-alpha therapy frequently have been hampered by high dropout rates due to side effects and inconvenient dosing schedules. Pegylated (PEG) IFN-alpha is formulated by covalently attaching polymers of ethylene glycol of large molecular weight to the native IFN-alpha molecule. Such chemical modification increases serum half-life, decreases renal excretion, and results in prolonged patient exposure to PEG-IFN-alpha, thus allowing for weekly administration while maintaining acceptable toxicity, tolerability, and activity profiles. The lack of adequate therapies for patients with MPDs and the superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of PEG-IFN-alpha relative to standard IFN-alpha has prompted the investigation of the activity and safety of PEG-IFN-alpha in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and idiopathic myelofibrosis.

With the recent discovery of the V617F mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) tyrosine kinase in almost all cases of PV and in a subset of patients with ET, studies are now pending to assess the role of this mutation in the hematopoietic cell activation process and/or in the occurrence of thromboses in ET and PV. The JAK2 V617F point mutation makes the normal hematopoietic progenitor cells hypersensitive to thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, and myeloid progenitor cells, leading to trilinear hematopoietic myeloproliferation. This will have three main clinical consequences during long-term follow-up. First, spontaneous growth of enlarged mature megakaryocytes in ET/PV with overproduction of hypersensitive platelets results in a broad spectrum of platelet-mediated microvascular circulatory disturbances, which are very sensitive to low-dose aspirin. Second, spontaneous growth of erythropoiesis with the overproduction of erythrocytes leads to classic PV with increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell mass. This is associated with a high frequency of major arterial and venous thrombotic complications in addition to platelet-mediated microvascular circulatory disturbances of thrombocythemia. Third, the slowly progressive myeloid (granulocytic) metaplasia in bone marrow and spleen is complicated by secondary myelofibrosis caused by a megakaryocytic/granulocytic cytokine storm in about one fourth to one third of JAK2 V617F-positive PV patients after long-term follow-up, with no tendency of leukemic transformation as long as they are not treated with myelosuppressive agents. Randomized clinical trials directly comparing phlebotomy versus hydroxyurea or interferon alpha versus hydroxyurea in PV with progressive disease are lacking. Heterozygous V617F mutation is enough to produce the clinical picture of ET with a slight tendency to increased hemoglobin and hematocrit (early PV mimicking ET). Homozygous V617F mutation is associated with the clinical picture of classic PV and with a higher tendency to secondary myelofibrosis, but with no increased leukemia unless other biological or genetic factors come into play, such as myelosuppressive agents or the acquisition of additional biologic or genetic defects. Depending on the biological background of individual patients, heterozygous and homozygous JAK2 V617F ET/PV may preferentially induce myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis with a relative suppression of megakaryocytic and erythropoietic myeloproliferation leading to clinical pictures of fibrotic chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. The main conclusion is that JAK2 V617F is a 100% specific clue to a new distinct clonal myeloproliferative disorder. JAK2 V617F-positive ET/PV and CIMF should be distinguished from wild-type JAK2 ET, rare cases of PV, and CIMF, and should be evaluated during life-long follow-up.","['Bellucci, Sylvia', 'Michiels, Jan J']","['Bellucci S', 'Michiels JJ']","[""AP-HP, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Lariboisiere, Denis Diderot, Faculte de Medecine, Paris, France. sylvia.bellucci@lrb.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet Activation/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Thrombopoiesis/genetics', 'Thrombosis/etiology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/26 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-942759 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2006 Jun;32(4 Pt 2):381-98. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-942759.,136,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimuli such as ultraviolet irradiation and chemical reagents that damage genomic DNA induce the activation of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway. However, it is unclear how the signal arising in the nucleus owing to DNA damage is transmitted to SAPK/JNK in the cytoplasm. Here, we report that the nuclear components Daxx and Ras-association domain family 1C (RASSF1C) link DNA damage to SAPK/JNK activation in HeLa cells. In response to DNA damage, Daxx localized in promyelocytic leukaemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. RASSF1C, a tumor suppressor and newly identified binding partner of Daxx, is constitutively anchored by Daxx in PML-NBs but is released from the nucleus when Daxx is degraded. This released RASSF1C translocates to cytoplasmic microtubules and participates in the activation of SAPK/JNK. Our data define a novel mechanism by which the Daxx-RASSF1C complex in PML-NBs couples nuclear DNA damage to the cytoplasmic SAPK/JNK signaling pathway.","['Kitagawa, Daiju', 'Kajiho, Hiroaki', 'Negishi, Takahiro', 'Ura, Seiji', 'Watanabe, Tomomi', 'Wada, Teiji', 'Ichijo, Hidenori', 'Katada, Toshiaki', 'Nishina, Hiroshi']","['Kitagawa D', 'Kajiho H', 'Negishi T', 'Ura S', 'Watanabe T', 'Wada T', 'Ichijo H', 'Katada T', 'Nishina H']","['The Department of Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/09/06 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2005/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['7601212 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601212 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2006 Jul 26;25(14):3286-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601212.

Favorable results of these studies led to accelerated approval for use of bortezomib in MM patients who have progressed after at least their second therapy and, more recently, to expanded approval for second-line use in patients on whom one prior therapy has failed. In the meantime, combination studies of bortezomib with various agents, including dexamethasone, DNA-damaging drugs, thalidomide and lenalidomide, have been designed and are currently ongoing in patients with both relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed disease.

We determined the transforming activity of MN1-TEL in mouse bone marrow (BM) by using retroviral transfer. MN1-TEL-transduced BM showed increased self-renewal capacity of primitive progenitors in vitro, and prolonged in vitro culture of MN1-TEL-expressing BM produced immortalized myeloid, interleukin (IL)-3/stem cell factor-dependent cell lines with a primitive morphology. Transplantation of such cell lines into lethally irradiated mice rescued them from irradiation-induced death and resulted in the contribution of MN1-TEL-expressing cells to all hematopoietic lineages, underscoring the primitive nature of these cells and their capacity to differentiate in vivo. Three months after transplantation, all mice succumbed to promonocytic leukemia. Transplantation of freshly MN1-TEL-transduced BM into lethally irradiated mice also caused acute myeloid leukemia within 3 months of transplantation.

Recent studies reported that PPARgamma ligands inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in both normal and malignant B-lineage cells. We investigated the expression of PPARgamma and the effects of PPARgamma ligands on UTree-O2, Bay91 and 380, three B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines with t(14;18), which show a poor prognosis, accompanying c-myc abnormality. Western blot analysis identified expression of PPARgamma protein and real-time PCR that of PPARgamma mRNA on the three cell lines. Troglitazone (TGZ), a synthetic PPARgamma ligand, inhibited cell growth in these cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also found this effect PPARgamma independent since PPARgamma antagonists failed to reverse this effect. We assessed the expression of c-myc, an apoptosis-regulatory gene, since c-myc abnormality was detected in most B-ALL cells with t(14;18). TGZ was found to dose-dependently downregulate the expression of c-myc mRNA and c-myc protein in the three cell lines. These results suggest that TGZ inhibits cell growth via induction of G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cell lines and that TGZ-induced apoptosis, at least in part, may be related to the downregulation of c-myc expression. Moreover, the downregulation of c-myc expression by TGZ may depend on a PPARgamma-independent mechanism. Further studies indicate that PPARgamma ligands may serve as a therapeutic agent in B-ALL with t(14;18).","['Takenokuchi, M', 'Saigo, K', 'Nakamachi, Y', 'Kawano, S', 'Hashimoto, M', 'Fujioka, T', 'Koizumi, T', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Kumagai, S']","['Takenokuchi M', 'Saigo K', 'Nakamachi Y', 'Kawano S', 'Hashimoto M', 'Fujioka T', 'Koizumi T', 'Tatsumi E', 'Kumagai S']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromans/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'PPAR gamma/agonists/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Troglitazone']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/26 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['92345 [pii]', '10.1159/000092345 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2006;116(1):30-40. doi: 10.1159/000092345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular pathways that control these cellular behaviors are still poorly understood. Cybr is a scaffold protein highly expressed in the hematopoietic/immune system whose physiological role is still unknown. In vitro studies have shown it regulates LFA-1, a crucial molecule in lymphocyte attachment and migration. Cybr also binds cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF GTPases, which affects actin cytoskeleton remodeling during cell migration. Here we show that expression of Cybr in vivo is differentially modulated by type 1 cytokines during lymphocyte maturation. In mice, Cybr deficiency negatively affects leukocytes circulating in blood and lymphocytes present in the lymph nodes. Moreover, in a Th1-polarized mouse model, lymphocyte trafficking is impaired by loss of Cybr, and Cybr-deficient mice with aseptic peritonitis have fewer cells than controls present in the peritoneal cavity, as well as fewer leukocytes leaving the bloodstream. Mutant mice injected with Moloney murine sarcoma/leukemia virus develop significantly larger tumors than wild-type mice and have reduced lymph node enlargement, suggesting reduced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte migration. Taken together, these data support a role for Cybr in leukocyte trafficking, especially in response to proinflammatory cytokines in stress conditions.","['Coppola, Vincenzo', 'Barrick, Colleen A', 'Bobisse, Sara', 'Rodriguez-Galan, Maria Cecilia', 'Pivetta, Michela', 'Reynolds, Della', 'Howard, O M Zack', 'Palko, Mary Ellen', 'Esteban, Pedro F', 'Young, Howard A', 'Rosato, Antonio', 'Tessarollo, Lino']","['Coppola V', 'Barrick CA', 'Bobisse S', 'Rodriguez-Galan MC', 'Pivetta M', 'Reynolds D', 'Howard OM', 'Palko ME', 'Esteban PF', 'Young HA', 'Rosato A', 'Tessarollo L']","['Neural Development Group, Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA. coppolav@ncifcrf.gov']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus', 'Peritonitis/immunology/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/pathology']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/12 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/14/5249 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.02473-05 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Jul;26(14):5249-58. doi: 10.1128/MCB.02473-05.,,,,,PMC1592701,,,,,,,,,

This study intensified systemic therapy by delaying CNS radiation for 12 months and tailored CNS radiation by CR1 duration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six children with first isolated CNS relapse of ALL were treated with systemic chemotherapy that effectively penetrates into the CSF and intrathecal chemotherapy for 12 months. Patients with CR1 of less than 18 months received craniospinal radiation (24 Gy cranial/15 Gy spinal), whereas those with CR1 of 18 months or more received cranial radiation only (18 Gy), followed by maintenance chemotherapy. Additionally, asymptomatic patients were enrolled in a thiotepa up-front therapeutic window. RESULTS: Seventy-four (97.4%) of 76 eligible patients achieved a second remission. Overall 4-year event-free survival (EFS) for the 71 precursor B-cell patients was 70.1% +/- 5.8%. CR1 duration and National Cancer Institute (NCI; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) risk group at initial diagnosis predicted outcome. Patients with CR1 of less than 18 months and 18 months or more had a 4-year EFS of 51.6% +/- 11.3% and 77.7% +/- 6.4% (P = .027), respectively. NCI high- versus standard-risk 4-year EFS was 51.4% +/- 10.8% and 80.2% +/- 6.3% (P = .0018), respectively. A significant difference in EFS between standard risk/CR1 of at least 18 months and both high risk/CR1 of less than 18 months and high risk/CR1 of at least 18 months groups was detected (P = .0068 and .0314, respectively). Response rate to thiotepa was 78%. Most relapses involved the bone marrow, and three second malignancies were reported. CONCLUSION: Twelve months of intensive systemic chemotherapy with reduced dose cranial radiation (18 Gy) is highly effective for children with isolated CNS relapse and CR1 of 18 months or more. Novel strategies are needed for patients with CR1 of less than 18 months.","['Barredo, Julio C', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Lauer, Stephen J', 'Billett, Amy', 'Marymont, Maryanne', 'Pullen, Jeanette', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Carroll, William', 'Ritchey, A Kim']","['Barredo JC', 'Devidas M', 'Lauer SJ', 'Billett A', 'Marymont M', 'Pullen J', 'Camitta B', 'Winick N', 'Carroll W', 'Ritchey AK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA. barredjc@musc.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/19/3142 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.3373 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 1;24(19):3142-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.3373.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells treated with interleukin-21 (IL-21) produce low levels of granzyme B. The addition of either CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) or anti-B-cell-receptor antibody (anti-BCR) to IL-21 results in enhanced production of functional granzyme B by B-CLL cells. B-CLL cells treated with IL-21 and CpG ODN undergo apoptosis and are able to induce apoptosis of untreated bystander B-CLL cells. This effect can be inhibited by anti-granzyme B antibody. Benign human B cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts, and many standard lymphoma cell lines produce high levels of granzyme B in response to IL-21 and anti-BCR. Our results suggest that the ability to induce production of functional granzyme B by B cells could open new approaches to the therapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies. Our findings also have significant implications for our understanding of the role of B cells for immune regulation and for a variety of immune phenomena, including cancer immunity, autoimmunity, and infectious immunity.","['Jahrsdorfer, Bernd', 'Blackwell, Sue E', 'Wooldridge, James E', 'Huang, Jian', 'Andreski, Melinda W', 'Jacobus, Laura S', 'Taylor, Christiana M', 'Weiner, George J']","['Jahrsdorfer B', 'Blackwell SE', 'Wooldridge JE', 'Huang J', 'Andreski MW', 'Jacobus LS', 'Taylor CM', 'Weiner GJ']","['Holden Cancer Center at the University of Iowa, 5970Z JPP, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P50 CA 97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 77764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (IL21R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-21 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-21)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-21 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-21', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52457-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-014001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 15;108(8):2712-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-014001.

Using FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) as a molecular marker, we tested the hypothesis that clinical outcome in AML correlates with disease involvement of CD34(+)/CD33(-) precursors. Diagnostic specimens from 24 children with FLT3/ITD-positive AML were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and resultant CD34(+)/CD33(-) and CD34(+)/CD33(+) progenitors were analyzed directly and after colony-forming cell (CFC) assay for the presence of FLT3/ITD. FLT3/ITD was present in all CD34(+)/CD33(+) patient samples. In contrast, FLT3/ITD was detected in CD34(+)/CD33(-) progenitors in only 19 of 24 samples. A bipotent progenitor was affected in a subset of patients, as evidenced by the presence of FLT3/ITD in both granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) and erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) colonies.

We have previously demonstrated that lactoferrin, a major milk protein, enhances HTLV-1 replication, at least in part by upregulating the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat promoter. We now report that HTLV-1 infection can induce lactoferrin gene expression. Coculture with HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells increased the levels of lactoferrin mRNA in myeloid-differentiated HL-60 cells, as well as MCF-7 cells, models of two probable sources (neutrophils and mammary epithelium) of lactoferrin in breast milk. MT-2 cell coculture could be replaced with cell-free culture supernatants of MT-2 cells to exert the same effect. Furthermore, extracellularly administered Tax protein also induced lactoferrin gene expression at physiologically relevant concentrations. In transient-expression assays, Tax transactivated the lactoferrin gene promoter in HL-60 or MCF-7 cells. Experiments with Tax mutants, as well as site-directed mutants of the lactoferrin promoter reporters, indicated that the NF-kappaB transactivation pathway is critical for Tax induction of the lactoferrin gene promoter activity in myeloid-differentiated HL-60 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that HTLV-1 infection may be able to induce expression of lactoferrin in a paracrine manner in the lactic compartment. Our findings, in conjunction with our previous study, implicate that mutual interaction between HTLV-1 and lactoferrin would benefit milk-borne transmission of this virus.","['Moriuchi, Masako', 'Moriuchi, Hiroyuki']","['Moriuchi M', 'Moriuchi H']","['Deparment of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Medical Virology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*biosynthesis', 'Mammary Glands, Human/cytology/*metabolism/virology', '*Milk, Human/virology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/virology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/virology', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/31 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/14/7118 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00409-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(14):7118-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00409-06.,,,,,PMC1489047,,,,,,,,,

While simple retroviruses possess a natural tumor selectivity in that they can transduce only actively dividing cells, additional tumor-targeting strategies would nevertheless be advantageous, since tumor cells are not the only actively dividing cells. In this study, we used the promiscuous murine cytomegalovirus promoter, a chimeric regulatory sequence consisting of the hepatitis B virus enhancer II and the human alpha1-antitrypsin (EII-Pa1AT) promoter, and a synthetic regulatory sequence consisting of a series of T-cell factor binding sites named the CTP4 promoter to generate replicating MLV vectors, whereby the last two are transcriptionally restricted to liver- and beta-catenin/T-cell factor-deregulated cells, respectively. When the heterologous promoters were used to replace almost the entire MLV U3 region, including the MLV TATA box, vector replication was inefficient since nascent virus particle production from infected cells was greatly decreased. Fusion of the heterologous promoters lacking the TATA box to the MLV TATA box, however, generated vectors which replicated with almost-wild-type kinetics throughout permissive cells while exhibiting low or negligible spread in nonpermissive cells. The genomic stability of the vectors was shown to be comparable to that of a similar vector containing wild-type MLV long terminal repeats, and tropism analysis over repeated infection cycles showed that the targeted vectors retained their original specificity.","['Metzl, Christian', 'Mischek, Daniela', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Renner, Matthias', 'Portsmouth, Daniel']","['Metzl C', 'Mischek D', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Renner M', 'Portsmouth D']","['Research Institute for Virology and Biomedicine, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinaerplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', '*Genes, Synthetic/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', '*Liver/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/therapy/virology', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Replication/genetics', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/31 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/14/7070 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00020-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(14):7070-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00020-06.,,,,,PMC1489065,,,,,,,,,

TORC coactivation requires CREB, but not ATF4 or other bZIP factors. Tax physically interacts with TORC1, TORC2, and TORC3 (TORC1/2/3), and the depletion of TORC1/2/3 inhibited Tax activity. TORC coactivation can be further enhanced by transcriptional coactivator p300. In addition, coactivators in the p300 family are required for full activity of Tax independently of TORC1/2/3.

Recently described molecular risk features may help delineate at initial diagnosis which patients will have a more aggressive course. Newer treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogs and monoclonal antibodies have increased the rate of molecular complete remissions, which may lead to increased survival. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens have made the potentially curative modality of allogeneic transplantation more widely available. All of these recent treatments have significant risks of infectious complications, which must be carefully weighed against the risks posed by the underlying disease, and many low-risk asymptomatic patients do not require any treatment.

There were 5,801 radiation workers, including 2,232 monitored for radionuclide intakes. The mean dose from external radiation was 13.5 mSv (maximum 1 Sv); the mean lung dose from external and internal radiation combined was 19.0 mSv (maximum 3.6 Sv). Vital status was determined for 97.6% of the workers of whom 25.3% (n = 1,468) had died. The average period of observation was 27.9 years. All cancers taken together (SMR 0.93; 95% CI 0.84-1.02) and all leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (SMR 1.21; 95% CI 0.69-1.97) were not significantly elevated. No SMR was significantly increased for any cancer or for any other cause of death. The Cox regression analyses revealed no significant dose-response trends for any cancer. For all cancers excluding leukemia, the RR at 100 mSv was estimated as 1.00 (95% CI 0.81-1.24), and for all leukemia excluding CLL it was 1.34 (95% CI 0.73-2.45). The nonsignificant increase in leukemia (excluding CLL) was in accord with expectation from other radiation studies, but a similar nonsignificant increase in CLL (a malignancy not found to be associated with radiation) tempers a causal interpretation. Radiation exposure has not caused a detectable increase in cancer deaths in this population, but results are limited by small numbers and relatively low career doses.","['Boice, John D', 'Cohen, Sarah S', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Dupree Ellis, Elizabeth', 'Eckerman, Keith F', 'Leggett, Richard W', 'Boecker, Bruce B', 'Brill, A Bertrand', 'Henderson, Brian E']","['Boice JD', 'Cohen SS', 'Mumma MT', 'Dupree Ellis E', 'Eckerman KF', 'Leggett RW', 'Boecker BB', 'Brill AB', 'Henderson BE']","['International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA. john.boice@vanderbilt.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Nuclear Reactors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Radioisotopes/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', '*Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3582 [pii]', '10.1667/RR3582.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2006 Jul;166(1 Pt 1):98-115. doi: 10.1667/RR3582.1.,,,,,,,,['Radiat Res. 2006 Sep;166(3):566'],,,,,,

Subsequently, several hundred thousand cleanup workers were sent to the Chornobyl power plant to mitigate the consequences of the accident. Depending on the nature of the work to be carried out, the cleanup workers were sent for periods ranging from several minutes to several months. The average dose from external radiation exposure that was received by the cleanup workers was about 170 mGy in 1986 and decreased from year to year. The radiation exposure was mainly due to external irradiation from gamma-ray-emitting radionuclides and was relatively homogeneous over all organs and tissues of the body. To assess the possible health consequences of external irradiation at relatively low dose rates, the U.S. National Cancer Institute is involved in two studies of Chornobyl cleanup workers: (1) a study of cancer incidence and thyroid disease among Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian workers, and (2) a study of leukemia and other related blood diseases among Ukrainian workers. After an overview of the sources of exposure and of the radiation doses received by the cleanup workers, a description of the efforts made to estimate individual doses in the Baltic and Ukrainian studies is presented.","['Bouville, Andre', 'Chumak, Vadim V', 'Inskip, Peter D', 'Kryuchkov, Viktor', 'Luckyanov, Nickolas']","['Bouville A', 'Chumak VV', 'Inskip PD', 'Kryuchkov V', 'Luckyanov N']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. bouvilla@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Baltic States/epidemiology', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Decontamination/*statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Power Plants/statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods', 'Radioactive Hazard Release/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2006/07/01 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/07/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3370 [pii]', '10.1667/RR3370.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2006 Jul;166(1 Pt 2):158-67. doi: 10.1667/RR3370.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report the long-term results of the two consecutive trials of Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG), incorporating repetitive use of high-dose cytarabine (HD-Ara-C) based combination chemotherapy in post-remission phase. PROCEDURE: A total of 216 eligible children with newly diagnosed AML were treated in the two consecutive multi-center trials of TCCSG, M91-13 and M96-14, from August 1991 to September 1998. In M91-13 trial, patients received eight courses of intensive post-remission chemotherapy, including six HD-Ara-C containing courses, after remission-induction therapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be selected by physician's choice, and allogeneic HSCT was allocated if donor was available. In M96-14 trial, the last two HD-Ara-C courses were omitted from the chemotherapy arm. RESULTS: The remission-induction rate was 88.8% and probability of 5-year Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 62% (56-69% with 95% Confidence intervals (CIs)) and 56% (49-62%), respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 7.8%. Among patients without Down syndrome (DS) or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the presence of t(8;21) or inv(16) was a significant good prognostic factor both in the univariate and multivariate analyses. Children with DS (N = 10) and APL (N = 14) also showed a good survival exceeding 70% in 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that repetitive use of HD-Ara-C was effective and safe for childhood AML. However, further optimization of AML therapy is required.","['Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Tabuchi, Ken', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Kigasawa, Hisato', 'Tsukimoto, Ichiro', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro']","['Tomizawa D', 'Tabuchi K', 'Kinoshita A', 'Hanada R', 'Kigasawa H', 'Tsukimoto I', 'Tsuchida M']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. dtomizawa.ped@tmd.ac.jp']","[""Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology/mortality', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/06/30 09:00,2007/08/25 09:00,['2006/06/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20944 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Aug;49(2):127-32. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20944.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intra-articular injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) has been used as viscosupplementation for knee OA but its effect on synoviocytes remains undisclosed. This study aims to investigate the effects of HMW-HA on the gene expression of 16 OA-associated cytokines and enzymes, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, aggrecanase-1, aggrecanase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with early stage OA. METHOD: Synovial fluid-derived FLS were obtained from the knees of 15 patients with early stage OA. IL-1-stimulated or unstimulated FLS were cultured with or without the treatment of 600-800kDa HMW-HA. Moreover, blocking experiments with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used to examine the involvement of CD44 in HMW-HA effects. We designed and validated the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) assays with SYBR Green dyes for simultaneous quantification of the expression of the 16 genes. RESULTS: HMW-HA down-regulated IL-8 and iNOS gene expression in unstimulated FLS and down-regulated aggrecanase-2 and TNF-alpha gene expression in IL-1-stimulated FLS. CD44 blocking inhibited the down-regulatory effects of HMW-HA on gene expression. CONCLUSION: HMW-HA may have a structure-modifying effect for OA by down-regulation of aggrecanase-2 in FLS. HMW-HA also has an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulation of TNF-alpha, IL-8, and iNOS in FLS. These effects may be mediated through the interaction of CD44 and HMW-HA.","['Wang, C-T', 'Lin, Y-T', 'Chiang, B-L', 'Lin, Y-H', 'Hou, S-M']","['Wang CT', 'Lin YT', 'Chiang BL', 'Lin YH', 'Hou SM']","['Department of Orthopedics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAMTS5 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAMTS5 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'ADAMTS5 Protein', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee/immunology/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Synovial Fluid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/06/30 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2006/06/30 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1063-4584(06)00158-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.joca.2006.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2006 Dec;14(12):1237-47. doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2006.05.009.

In the absence of IL-2, human CD4(+) T cell blasts were sensitive to both FasL and Apo2L/TRAIL, but human CD8(+) T cell blasts died, with no additional effect of death receptor ligation. CD8(+) T cell blasts were more sensitive than CD4(+) T cell blasts to apoptosis induction by IL-2 deprivation, which was associated with a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, especially of Mcl-1 in CD8(+) T cell blasts. The maintenance of high levels of Bim expression was also necessary, since down-modulation of Bim expression by siRNA in normal human CD8(+) T cell blasts greatly reduced apoptosis by IL-2 deprivation. These data, together with previous works, point to an important role of the presence or absence of immuno-stimulatory cytokines in the type of regulation of human CD8(+) T cell responses (death by cytokine deprivation versus death receptor inhibition of cytokine-dependent growth).","['Bosque, Alberto', 'Marzo, Isabel', 'Naval, Javier', 'Anel, Alberto']","['Bosque A', 'Marzo I', 'Naval J', 'Anel A']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza E-50009, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*deficiency/genetics', 'Ligands', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/immunology/*metabolism']",2006/06/30 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/06/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(06)00173-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2006.04.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2007 Feb;44(6):1446-53. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2006.04.029.

Selected immune relevant genes are listed and two genes, for myeloid leukemia differentiation protein (Mcl-1) and opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr), obtained from the susceptible salmon library were characterised. Both sequences showed high amino acid identity and similarity with human and mouse isoforms, and their possible involvement in the response of salmon to G. salaris is discussed. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed for both genes. Upregulation of Mcl-1 in B1 backcross salmon of the susceptible phenotypic category compared with resistant salmon was demonstrated. The possible relationship of the salmon Mcl-1 and cytokines (interleukin 1beta) in the G. salaris-induced host response is discussed. Potential involvement of OGFr in the depletion of mucous cells during prolonged and heavy G. salaris infection, via suppression of DNA synthesis and profound decrease in basal cell proliferation, is proposed. However, only two of six susceptible fish showed high upregulation of OGFr, which might indicate that its expression is localised to sites of wounds resulting from a heavy burden of G. salaris.","['Matejusova, Iveta', 'Felix, Benjamin', 'Sorsa-Leslie, Tarja', 'Gilbey, John', 'Noble, Leslie R', 'Jones, Catherine S', 'Cunningham, Carey O']","['Matejusova I', 'Felix B', 'Sorsa-Leslie T', 'Gilbey J', 'Noble LR', 'Jones CS', 'Cunningham CO']","['FRS Marine Laboratory, P.O.

CD33 expression exceeded 20% in all cases. METHODS: GO was administered alone, at a unit dose of 3-9 mg/m2, once (3 patients), twice (3 patients), three (5 patients) or five times (1 patient). Mean follow-up was 128 days (8-585 d). RESULTS: There were three complete responses (25%) leading to further curative treatment (SCT). Treatment failed in the other nine patients, and only one patient was alive at the end of follow-up.

Previously, we showed that human T-cell leukemia virus type I-transgenic mice and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist-knockout mice develop autoimmunity and joint-specific inflammation that resembles human RA. To identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of these animal models by using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We found 1,467 genes that were differentially expressed from the normal control mice by greater than threefold in one of these animal models. The gene expression profiles of the two models correlated well. We extracted 554 genes whose expression significantly changed in both models, assuming that pathogenically important genes at the effector phase would change in both models. Then, each of these commonly changed genes was mapped into the whole genome in a scale of the 1-megabase pairs. We found that the transcriptome map of these genes did not distribute evenly on the chromosome but formed clusters. These identified gene clusters include the major histocompatibility complex class I and class II genes, complement genes, and chemokine genes, which are well known to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA at the effector phase. The activation of these gene clusters suggests that antigen presentation and lymphocyte chemotaxis are important for the development of arthritis. Moreover, by searching for such clusters, we could detect genes with marginal expression changes.

Thus, by combining two etiologically different RA models, we succeeded in efficiently extracting genes functioning in the development of arthritis at the effector phase.

Centrosome amplification was recently described as a possible cause of aneuploidy in certain solid tumors and leukemias. ATL is a T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1. Although the precise mechanism of cell transformation is unclear, the HTLV-1-encoded protein, Tax, is thought to play a crucial role in leukemogenesis. Here we demonstrate that lymphocytes isolated from patients with ATL show centrosome amplification and that a human T cell line shows centrosome amplification after induction of Tax, which was suppressed by CDK inhibitors. Micronuclei formation was also observed after centrosome amplification in Tax-induced human T cells. These findings suggest that Tax deregulates CDK activity and induces centrosome amplification, which might be associated with cellular transformation by HTLV-1 and chromosomal instability in HTLV-1-infected human T cells.","['Nitta, Takayuki', 'Kanai, Masayuki', 'Sugihara, Eiji', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Sun, Binlian', 'Nagasawa, Toshiro', 'Sonoda, Shunro', 'Saya, Hideyuki', 'Miwa, Masanao']","['Nitta T', 'Kanai M', 'Sugihara E', 'Tanaka M', 'Sun B', 'Nagasawa T', 'Sonoda S', 'Saya H', 'Miwa M']","['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Centrosome/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",2006/06/30 09:00,2006/10/19 09:00,['2006/06/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS254 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00254.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2006 Sep;97(9):836-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00254.x.

We report a novel chromosomal translocation in a T-ALL patient that maps upstream of the HOXA13 gene and downstream of the BCL11B/CTIP2 locus. Analysis of HOXA gene transcription demonstrated massive expression of HOXA13, whereas the other HOXA genes were unaffected. A genomic rearrangement of the HOXA locus associated with exclusive expression of HOXA13 was observed in a second patient. This situation resembles chromosomal translocations activating genes of the TLX/HOX11 family in T-ALLs. To compare the leukemogenic properties of HOXA13 to that of TLX proteins, cohorts of lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with bone marrow transduced with a retroviral vector expressing TLX3 or HOXA13. Cells transduced with TLX3 or HOXA13 could not be detected in the peripheral blood of mice post-transplantation and none of the mice developed malignancies. Cotransduction of the HOX cofactor MEIS1 with TLX3 or HOXA13 did not alter this outcome. However, in a myeloid clonogenic assay HOXA13 and TLX3 extended the proliferation of progenitors similarly to what was observed for TLX1. Altogether, our results strongly suggest the absolute requirement for cooperative events in association with homeobox gene up-regulation to induce T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Su, Xinying', 'Drabkin, Harry', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Morgado, Ester', 'Busson, Maryvonne', 'Romana, Serge', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Berger, Roland', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Lavau, Catherine']","['Su X', 'Drabkin H', 'Clappier E', 'Morgado E', 'Busson M', 'Romana S', 'Soulier J', 'Berger R', 'Bernard OA', 'Lavau C']","['INSERM E0210, IRNEM, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],['R33 CA 097710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA13)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20348 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Sep;45(9):846-55. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20348.,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although the clinical syndrome and the pathologic characteristics are well defined, little is known about its biology and controversy still exists regarding its cell of origin. In this gene-expression study, we compared the transcription profiles of WM with those of other malignant B cells including (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and multiple myeloma [MM]) as well as normal cells (peripheral-blood B cells and bone marrow plasma cells). We found that WM has a homogenous gene expression regardless of 6q deletion status and clusters with CLL and normal B cells on unsupervised clustering with very similar expression profiles. Only a small gene set has expression profiles unique to WM compared to CLL and MM.

However, there are relatively few insights into the genetic etiology of AMKL. We developed a screening assay for mutations that cause AMKL, based on the hypothesis that constitutive activation of STAT5 would be a biochemical indicator of mutation in an upstream effector tyrosine kinase. We screened human AMKL cell lines for constitutive STAT5 activation, and then used an approach combining mass spectrometry identification of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and growth inhibition in the presence of selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that would inform DNA sequence analysis of candidate tyrosine kinases. Using this strategy, we identified a new JAK2T875N mutation in the AMKL cell line CHRF-288-11. JAK2T875N is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that activates downstream effectors including STAT5 in hematopoietic cells in vitro. In a murine transplant model, JAK2T875N induced a myeloproliferative disease characterized by features of AMKL, including megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the spleen; impaired megakaryocyte polyploidization; and increased reticulin fibrosis of the bone marrow and spleen.

Epidemiologic studies have usually been hampered by small numbers, making accurate estimates of thrombosis risk in ALL patients very difficult. The aim of this study was to better estimate the frequency of this complication and to define how the disease, its treatment, and the host contribute to its occurrence. We made an attempt to combine and analyze all published data on the association between pediatric ALL and thrombosis, by using a meta-analytic method. The rate of thrombosis in 1752 children from 17 prospective studies was 5.2% (95% CI: 4.2-6.4). The risk varies depending on several factors. Most of the events occurred during the induction phase of therapy. Lower doses of asparaginase (ASP) for long periods were associated with the highest incidence of thrombosis, as were anthracyclines and prednisone (instead of dexamethasone). The presence of central lines and of thrombophilic genetic abnormalities also appeared to be frequently associated with thrombosis. In conclusion, the overall thrombotic risk in ALL children was significant, and the subgroup analysis was able to identify high-risk individuals, a finding that will hopefully guide future prospective studies aimed at decreasing this risk.","['Caruso, Vanesa', 'Iacoviello, Licia', 'Di Castelnuovo, Augusto', 'Storti, Sergio', 'Mariani, Guglielmo', 'de Gaetano, Giovanni', 'Donati, Maria Benedetta']","['Caruso V', 'Iacoviello L', 'Di Castelnuovo A', 'Storti S', 'Mariani G', 'de Gaetano G', 'Donati MB']","['Laboratory of Genetic and Environmental Epidemiology, Research Laboratories, Centre for High Technology Research and Education in Biomedical Sciences, Catholic University, 86100 Campobasso, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prednisone/pharmacology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Thrombosis/*complications']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52501-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-04-015511 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 1;108(7):2216-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-04-015511.

We have now found that anti-hTfR IgG3-Av also inhibits the proliferation of additional human malignant B and plasma cells. Anti-hTfR IgG3-Av induces internalization and rapid degradation of the TfR. These events can be reproduced in cells treated with anti-hTfR IgG3 cross-linked with a secondary Ab, suggesting that they result from increased TfR cross-linking. Confocal microscopy of cells treated with anti-hTfR IgG3-Av shows that the TfR is directed to an intracellular compartment expressing the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. The degradation of TfR is partially blocked by cysteine protease inhibitors. Furthermore, cells treated with anti-hTfR IgG3-Av exhibit mitochondrial depolarization and activation of caspases 9, 8, and 3. The mitochondrial damage and cell death can be prevented by iron supplementation, but cannot be fully blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor. These results suggest that anti-hTfR IgG3-Av induces lethal iron deprivation, but the resulting cell death does not solely depend on caspase activation. This report provides insights into the mechanism of cell death induced by anti-TfR Abs such as anti-hTfR IgG3-Av, a molecule that may be useful in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma.","['Ng, Patrick P', 'Helguera, Gustavo', 'Daniels, Tracy R', 'Lomas, Simon Z', 'Rodriguez, Jose A', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Bonavida, Benjamin', 'Morrison, Sherie L', 'Penichet, Manuel L']","['Ng PP', 'Helguera G', 'Daniels TR', 'Lomas SZ', 'Rodriguez JA', 'Schiller G', 'Bonavida B', 'Morrison SL', 'Penichet ML']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, University of California-Los Angeles, 10833 Le Conte Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1782, USA. penichet@microbio.ucla.edu']",,['eng'],"['K01 CA086915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 86915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 107023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Siderophores)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Avidin/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*pharmacology', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Siderophores/pharmacology']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52461-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-04-020263 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 15;108(8):2745-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-04-020263.

The t(8;21) chromosomal translocation serves not only to disrupt WT AML1 function but also to introduce ETO activity during hematopoiesis. AML1-ETO was recently shown to inhibit E protein transactivation by physically displacing WT coactivator proteins in an interaction mediated by ETO. Here, we present the 3D solution structure of the human ETO TAFH (eTAFH) domain implicated in AML1-ETO:E protein interactions and report an unexpected fold similarity to paired amphipathic helix domains from the transcriptional corepressor Sin3. We identify and characterize a conserved surface on eTAFH that is essential for ETO:E protein recognition and show that the mutation of key conserved residues at this site alleviates ETO-based silencing of E protein transactivation. Our results address uncharacterized aspects of the corepression mechanism of ETO and suggest that eTAFH may serve to recruit ETO (or AML1-ETO) to DNA-bound transcription factors. Together, these findings imply that a cofactor exchange mechanism, analogous to that described for E protein inhibition, may represent a common mode of action for ETO.","['Plevin, Michael J', 'Zhang, Jinsong', 'Guo, Chun', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Ikura, Mitsuhiko']","['Plevin MJ', 'Zhang J', 'Guo C', 'Roeder RG', 'Ikura M']","['*Division of Signaling Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, 101 College Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 3125 Eden Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521; and.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 3125 Eden Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521; and.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021 roeder@mail.rockefeller.edu mikura@uhnres.utoronto.ca.', '*Division of Signaling Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, 101 College Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7; roeder@mail.rockefeller.edu mikura@uhnres.utoronto.ca.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors/*chemistry']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['0603463103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0603463103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jul 5;103(27):10242-10247. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0603463103.

It is well known that the activation of the small GTPase Rho leads to actin stress fibers assembly. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of simulated microgravity on the activation of Rho that is involved in actin fiber remodeling in cells. RESULTS: Clinorotation influences actin fiber remodeling and its related signaling pathways that involve the small GTPase Rho. Actin stress fiber remodeling was significantly inhibited to a greater extent in cells cultured under clinorotation than in static cultured cells. From the gene and protein expression analyses, we found that the expression level of leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), which activates Rho, was downregulated under clinorotation. Moreover, we identified the full-length LARG cDNA. The amount of GTP-bound RhoA, that is, the active form of RhoA, decreased under this condition. CONCLUSION: The activation of the small GTPase Rho was influenced by simulated microgravity generated by a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat. Furthermore, the full-length cDNA of bovine LARG, a member of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family, was identified, and its gene expression was observed to be downregulated under clinorotation. This downregulation subsequently resulted in the repression of RhoA activation. These results indicated that the disorganization of the actin fibers was caused by the inhibition of Rho activation by 3D clinorotation.","['Higashibata, Akira', 'Imamizo-Sato, Mari', 'Seki, Masaya', 'Yamazaki, Takashi', 'Ishioka, Noriaki']","['Higashibata A', 'Imamizo-Sato M', 'Seki M', 'Yamazaki T', 'Ishioka N']","['Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba Space Center, 2-1-1 Sengen, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8505, Japan. higashibata.akira@jaxa.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Biochem,BMC biochemistry,101084098,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Stress Fibers/metabolism', '*Weightlessness', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2091-7-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2091-7-19 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biochem. 2006 Jun 28;7:19. doi: 10.1186/1471-2091-7-19.,,20060628,,,PMC1524780,['GENBANK/AB188499'],,,,,,,,

He recognised that folic acid stimulated leukaemic cell growth and enhanced disease progression. He hypothesised that folic acid antagonists would inhibit or arrest the proliferation of cancer cells. His landmark study, published in 1948, demonstrated that a number of folic acid antagonists, including 4-aminopteroyl-glutamic acid (aminopterin) produced temporary remissions in children with acute undifferentiated leukaemia. These observations lead to the development and use of other chemotherapeutic agents, either singly or, more effectively, in combination for treating childhood and adult malignancies. He introduced actinomycin D for the treatment of metastatic and localised Wilms tumour. Under his guidance and leadership, both the 'Jimmy Fund', one of the first comprehensive paediatric oncology treatment centres, and the Children's Cancer Research Foundation, which later became the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, were founded.","['Miller, Denis R']",['Miller DR'],"['PAREXEL International, Waltham, MA 02451, USA. denis.miller@parexel.com']",,['eng'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Hematology/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'United States']",2006/06/29 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6119 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06119.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jul;134(1):20-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06119.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Farber S'],"['Farber, Sydney']",

Medical records were reviewed for pathologic diagnosis, patient age, associated neoplasms, type(s) of eczema, symptom duration, treatment, surgical procedures, recurrence, and length of follow-up. Patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median 71.5 years). Median duration of symptoms was 24 months (range 2-60 months). Type 1a (intraepithelial) Paget's disease accounted for 18 patients, with 3 type 1b (invasive) cases and 1 type 1c (intraepithelial disease with underlying adenocarcinoma) case. Mean length of follow-up was 53.7 months, and median follow-up was 49 months (range 6-199 months). Only two patients had an associated internal malignancy: T-cell leukemia and breast cancer. Mapping biopsy was performed in 14 of the 18 type 1a cases. All patients were free of disease at the surgical margins and are alive without recurrence. The four patients with type 1b or 1c disease had lymph node metastases. Two has died of disease, and two are alive with no recurrence. The rate of secondary malignancy seems to be low in primary cutaneous Paget's disease of the vulva. Mapping biopsy with careful examination of characteristic skin surface may be useful for surgery of type 1a cases. Inguinal lymphadenectomy is recommended in cases with question of invasion or known underlying adenocarcinoma.","['Niikura, H', 'Yoshida, H', 'Ito, K', 'Takano, T', 'Watanabe, H', 'Aiba, S', 'Yaegashi, N']","['Niikura H', 'Yoshida H', 'Ito K', 'Takano T', 'Watanabe H', 'Aiba S', 'Yaegashi N']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai 980-8574, Japan. niikura@mail.tains.tohoku.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma in Situ/diagnosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/diagnosis', 'Paget Disease, Extramammary/classification/*diagnosis/surgery', '*Vulva/pathology/surgery', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/*diagnosis/surgery']",2006/06/29 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/06/29 09:00'],"['2006/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['IJG602 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00602.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2006 May-Jun;16(3):1212-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00602.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Complementary DNA from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts treated with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) was used to probe a cytokine microarray. PBEF regulation by the IL-6-related cytokines, IL-6, sIL-6R, oncostatin M (OSM), IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. IL-6-mediated STAT-3 regulation of PBEF was determined using a cell-permeable STAT-3 inhibitor peptide. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced in wild-type (IL-6(+/+)) and IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice. PBEF and STAT were detected by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Synovial levels of PBEF were quantified by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: IL-6 trans-signaling regulated PBEF in a STAT-3-dependent manner. In addition, PBEF was regulated by the IL-6-related cytokine OSM, but not IL-11 or LIF. Flow cytometric analysis of the IL-6-related cognate receptors suggested that OSM regulates PBEF via its OSM receptor beta and not its LIF receptor. The involvement of PBEF in arthritis progression was confirmed in vivo, where induction of AIA resulted in a 4-fold increase in the synovial expression of PBEF. In contrast, little or no change was observed in IL-6(-/-) mice, in which the inflammatory infiltrate was markedly reduced and synovial STAT-1/3 activity was also impaired. Analysis of human RA synovial tissue confirmed that PBEF immunolocalized in apical synovial membrane cells, endothelial cells, adipocytes, and lymphoid aggregates. Synovial fluid levels of PBEF were significantly higher in RA patients than in osteoarthritis patients. CONCLUSION: Experiments presented herein demonstrate that PBEF is regulated via IL-6 trans-signaling and the IL-6-related cytokine OSM. PBEF is also actively expressed during arthritis. Although these data confirm an involvement of PBEF in disease progression, the consequence of its action remains to be determined.","['Nowell, Mari A', 'Richards, Peter J', 'Fielding, Ceri A', 'Ognjanovic, Simona', 'Topley, Nick', 'Williams, Anwen S', 'Bryant-Greenwood, Gillian', 'Jones, Simon A']","['Nowell MA', 'Richards PJ', 'Fielding CA', 'Ognjanovic S', 'Topley N', 'Williams AS', 'Bryant-Greenwood G', 'Jones SA']","['Medical Biochemistry and Immunology, Tenovus Building, School of Medicine, Heath Park Campus, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK. nowellma@cardiff.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncostatin M', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Synovial Fluid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Synovial Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2006/06/28 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.21942 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Jul;54(7):2084-95. doi: 10.1002/art.21942.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The self-renewal of pluripotent mouse ES cells has been shown to require extrinsic stimulation by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathways and the expression of the transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. However, the network of interactions among extrinsic and intrinsic determinants of ES cell pluripotency is currently poorly understood. Here, we show that Nanog expression is up-regulated in mouse ES cells by the binding of T (Brachyury) and STAT3 to an enhancer element in the mouse Nanog gene.

However, several studies have shown that, even in this generally considered homogeneous group, a distinction could be made with regard to prognosis. The outcome of IALL patients with ALL-1/MLL rearrangements at the 11q23 cytogenetic band, early pre-B immunophenotype, high WBC count and age below 6 mo is significantly worse than in patients without these characteristics, and current therapies appear inadequate in a significant number of cases. Therefore, an international protocol (Interfant 99) was recently started, using a more aggressive approach, which included lymphoid- and myeloid-specific drugs, and indications for stem-cell transplantation. We reviewed the clinical characteristics of the disease, the results of several recent international clinical trials, and our experience with 16 infants with acute lymphoid leukaemia diagnosed and treated at our institution. CONCLUSION: It is extremely important to stratify patients for prognosis, taking into account clinical and biological variables with independent prognostic value. The aim is to select more adequate, risk-adapted, therapeutic strategies which also consider related or unrelated bone marrow transplant consolidation for patients with very poor prognosis.","['Luciani, Matteo', 'Rana, Ippolita', 'Pansini, Valecia', 'Caniglia, Mauzilio', 'Coletti, Valentina', 'Maraschini, Alice', 'Lombardi, Alessandra', 'De Rossi, Giulio']","['Luciani M', 'Rana I', 'Pansini V', 'Caniglia M', 'Coletti V', 'Maraschini A', 'Lombardi A', 'De Rossi G']","['Haematology Division, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Research Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Norway,Acta Paediatr Suppl,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992).

Platelets have recently been shown to contain vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is released during clotting. We therefore studied the effects of (1) tumor cell-platelet adherence and tumor cell TF activity on platelet VEGF release; and (2) the effects of GpIIb/IIIa blockade on tumor cell-induced platelet VEGF release, tumor cell-induced thrombocytopenia and experimental metastasis. Adherent A375 human melanoma cells (TF+) and KG1 myeloid leukemia (TF-) cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from normal citrated whole blood and the presence of VEGF (34 and 44 kDa isoforms) confirmed by immunoblotting. Platelet-rich plasma with or without anti-GpIIb/IIIa (Abciximab) was added to A375 monolayers and supernatant VEGF measured by ELISA. Tumor cell-induced platelet activation and release were determined by CD62P expression and serotonin release respectively. In vitro, tumor cell-platelet adherence was evaluated by flow cytometry. In vivo, thrombocytopenia and lung seeding were assessed 30 min and 18 days, respectively, after i.v. injection of Lewis Lung carcinoma (LL2) cells into control or murine 7E3 F(ab')(2) (6 mg/ kg) athymic rats. Maximal in vitro platelet activation (72% serotonin release) occurred 30 min after adding platelets to tumor cells. At this time, 87% of the A375 cells had adhered to platelets. Abciximab significantly (P<0.05) reduced platelet adherence to tumor cells as evidenced by flow cytometry. Incubation of A375 cells with platelets induced VEGF release in a time-dependent manner. This release was significantly inhibited by Abciximab (81% at 30 min; P<0.05). In the presence of fibrinogen and FII, VEGF release induced by A375 (TF+) cells was significantly higher than that induced by KG1 (TF-) cells (105.5+/-24 vs. 42+/-7 pg/ml; P<0.001). Omitting fibrinogen or FII from the reaction mixture markedly decreased VEGF release. In vivo, GpIIb/IIIa blockade with murine 7E3 F(ab')(2) reduced LL2 tumor cell-induced thrombocytopenia by 90% (P<0.001) and lung seeding by 82% (P<0.05). We conclude that TF-bearing tumor cells can activate platelets largely via thrombin generation, and that such activation is associated with release of VEGF. This may enhance metastasis, possibly by increasing extravasation at points of adhesion to vascular endothelium.","['Amirkhosravi, A', 'Amaya, M', 'Siddiqui, F', 'Biggerstaff, J P', 'Meyer, T V', 'Francis, J L']","['Amirkhosravi A', 'Amaya M', 'Siddiqui F', 'Biggerstaff JP', 'Meyer TV', 'Francis JL']","['Clinical and Research Laboratories, Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Institute at Florida Hospital, Orlando, Florida 32804, USA.

We have characterized variations in serum levels of these two cytokines in acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Compared with healthy controls, serum Tpo levels were significantly increased prior to consolidation chemotherapy, and serum levels were correlated to peripheral blood platelet counts. Serum Tpo levels increased when the patients developed chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, and a further increase was observed during complicating bacterial infections. In contrast to Tpo, SCF serum levels in leukemia patients did not differ from healthy controls neither before chemotherapy nor during the period of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia.

Stromal cells can support other cells not only by direct contact but also via this ECM network. The regulated turnover and remodeling of ECM needs both ECM degrading enzymes named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Through an understanding of their molecular structure, the nature of the enzymic activity of MMPs and the inhibitory action of TIMPs against MMPs have been well elucidated. Considering their potent inhibitory action against MMPs, TIMPs are thought to play an important role in maintaining ECM. However, other unique functions of TIMPs have been reported, such as erythroid potentiating activity, cell growth-promoting activity, embryogenesis-stimulating activity, steroidogenesis-stimulating activity and so on. This review covers this new field, and discusses what role TIMPs can play in controlling life. In the second part, we briefly introduce our recent date on TIMPs and hematopoiesis. Because TIMPs have a dual function, i.e. a potent inhibitory action against MMPs and cell growth promoting action, TIMPs are good candidates for tissue fibrosis. Our recent measurements of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels using serum and plasma from patients with platelet number disorders and cultured medium from various leukemia cell lines, shows that platelets are a rich source of TIMPs and that TIMP-1 is secreted in large amounts by megakaryoblastic- and erythro-leukemia cell lines. Proliferation of bone marrow fibroblasts can be stimulated by TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Taken together, TIMPs might be one of the important factors for the process of myelofibrosis in some pathological conditions.","['Murate, T', 'Hayakawa, T']","['Murate T', 'Hayakawa T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,,,,2006/06/28 09:00,2006/06/28 09:01,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:01 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['6GXCWKD0GF7XGDM2 [pii]', '10.1080/09537109976293 [doi]']",ppublish,Platelets. 1999;10(1):5-16. doi: 10.1080/09537109976293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these patients, CC assay displayed normal donor karyotype, result of RT-PCR was negative, complete donor chimerism was detected after 2 months of transplantation, result of DD-FISH was negative, average time of the follow-up survey was 11.25 months, MRD did not increase. Results of CC and RT-PCR in 1 patient showed negative, while FISH of sex chromosome showed mixed chimerism, result of DD-FISH was positive, MRD did not increase, no therapy was given for this patient, clinical state of patient was stable. Three patients with hematological relapse demonstrated obvious increase of MRD detected by DD-FISH and sex FISH, result of RT-PCR was found positive in them, but the abnormal result of CC was observed only in 1 patient. After donor lymphocyte infusion and imatinib mesylate treatment, these 3 patients achieved cytogenetic remission again, results of DD-FISH, CC and PCR were negative in them. DD-FISH, CC and PCR in bone marrow and peripheral blood from one patient with extramedullary relapse revealed negative results, and the complete chimerism was found in this patient. It is concluded that interphase-dual-color and dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization is a more reliably sensitive and practicable method for monitoring MRD in patients with CML after allo-HSCT, and can be used in detection of chromosome sample and blood or bone marrow smears. Dynamic detection of bcr/abl fusion gene level by FISH may predict disease changes and guide individual therapy.","['Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Zhang, Run', 'Hong, Min', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Li, Li', 'Xu, Wei', 'Sheng, Rui-Lan', 'Wu, Han-Xin']","['Qian SX', 'Li JY', 'Zhang R', 'Hong M', 'Qiu HR', 'Li L', 'Xu W', 'Sheng RL', 'Wu HX']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province People Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2006/06/28 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)03-0577-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Jun;14(3):577-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wilms' tumor gene, WT1 mRNA, has been used as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) for evaluating therapeutic efficacy of patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study was aimed to investigate whether in vitro IL-12 can lower WT1 gene expression in peripheral blood monuclear cells (PBMNC) from patients with leukemia or MDS. PBMNC from these 30 patients and 5 healthy volunteers were cultured at 5 x 10(5) cells/ml alone with or without 100 units/ml of IL-12 for 3 days. WT1 mRNA was measured by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) since WT1 mRNA is considered as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia and MDS. The results demonstrated that WT1 mRNA in PBMNC of 5 healthy volunteers was less than 10(3) copies/microg of total RNA. Following the 3-day IL-12 treatment, mean WT1 mRNA of PBMNC was reduced from 10(4.8) to 10(4.2) copies/microg of total RNA in 6 CML patients, from 10(5.4) to 10(4.8) copies/microg in 12 MDS patients and from 10(5.0) to 10(4.2) copies/microg in 5 AML patients in CR, but not reduced in 5 of 7 AML in non-CR.

The NB4 cells were exposed to either bestatin and ATRA alone or in combination, the morphological changes of NB4 cells were observed by optical microscopy, the CD11b expression was measured by flow cytometry, the function of defferentiation cells was analyzed by nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, the mRNA expressions of c-myc and c-EBPepsilon in NB4 cells were detected by RT-PCR, the c-Myc protein expression was determined by Western blot. The results showed that treatment with bestatin alone induced no significant changes in morphology, NBT reduction activity and CD11b expression in NB4 cells. NB4 cells incubated with 10 nmol/L ATRA plus 100 microg/ml bestatin showed more morphologic feature of metamyelocyte and band neutrophil than ATRA alone treated cells. 100 microg/ml bestatin enhanced the NBT reduction activity in NB4 cells induced by various concentrations of ATRA (10, 20, 40 nmol/L). The effects of various concentrations of ATRA in combination with 100 microg/ml bestatin were statistically different from the effect of ATRA alone (P < 0.01). From 48 to 96 hours, 100 microg/ml bestatin time-dependently increased NBT reduction in NB4 cells induced by 10 nmol/L ATRA (P < 0.01). 10 nmol/L ATRA plus 100 microg/ml bestatin for 72 hours prominently elevated CD11b expression in NB4 cells as compared with ATRA alone treated NB4 cells (P < 0.01). There was a substantial decrease in c-myc mRNA levels when 100 microg/ml bestatin was added to 10 nmol/L ATRA (P < 0.05). Various concentrations (50, 75, 100 microg/ml) of bestatin combined with 10 nmol/L ATRA down-regulated the expression of c-Myc protein, which was negatively correlated with the NBT reduction activity of NB4 cells induced by 10 nmol/L ATRA alone or plus bestatin at various concentrations (r = -0.940, P = 0.017). However, 100 microg/ml bestatin plus 10 nmol/L ATRA could not induce any significant changes in the levels of c-EBPepsilon mRNA as compared with ATRA alone treated NB4 cells. It is concluded that an aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin can potentiate ATRA-inducing differentiation of NB4 cells, possibly by down-regulating c-myc expression in synergy with ATRA.","['Lin, Mao-Fang', 'Qian, Xi-Jun']","['Lin MF', 'Qian XJ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical College of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/06/28 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)03-0471-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Jun;14(3):471-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunophenotypes of 186 newly diagnosed APL patients and the percentages of cells identical with APL cell immunophenotypes in 20 normal bone marrow samples were analyzed using four-color flow cytometry. MRD in 172 specimens were monitored by mainly using CD34/CD117/CD123/HLA-DR four-color antibody panels, meanwhile 18 specimens were analyzed with the second antibody combination: CD9/CD117/CD34/CD33, simultaneously and the results were compared with real-time PCR. One hundred and sixteen of 172 bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) specimens were from follow-up 19 newly diagnosed APL patients and the rest 56 samples were from 47 patients treated 3 to 24 months later. Among them, 117 samples and 55 samples were collected after achieving morphologic complete remission (mCR) and before achieving mCR respectively. The results of immunophenotyping demonstrated that except CD9, CD33 and CD117 were high-expressed and CD34 and HLA-DR were rarely expressed, the CD123 was expressed in 30/30 (100%) APL patients. The percentages of CD117(+)CD34(-)CD123(+)HLA-DR(-) and CD117(+)CD34(-)CD9(+)CD33(+) cells in nucleated cells were 0.066% +/- 0.012% and 0.089% +/- 0.066% in 20 normal bone marrow samples. The median time of achieving morphology complete remission in 19 APL patients was 4 weeks (3 - 6 weeks). The median time of FCM and PCR results turned to be negative in 13 APL patients was 7.5 weeks (5 - 11) and the median time of PCR results turned to be negative in 11 APL patients was 8 weeks (5 - 12). 41/117 (35.04%) samples were MRD positive by FCM after achieving mCR. The ratio of CD117(+)CD34(-)CD123(+)HLA-DR(-) cells was < 5% in 33 specimens, but > 5% in another 8 specimens, their median percentages of CD117(+)CD34(-)CD123(+)HLA-DR(-) cells were 0.48% (range 0.02% - 4.70%) and 9.02% (range 5.26% - 18.14%) respectively. The median relative percentages of CD123(+)HLA-DR(-) cells in CD117(+)CD34(-) population were 63.59% (range 15.11% - 98.36%) and 86.77% (range 63.29% - 92.62%) respectively. In FCM MRD positive samples, 95.9% (93/97) were PCR positive, the false positive rate of FCM and the false negative rate of PCR were 4.1% (4/97) and 8.75% (7/93) respectively. In FCM negative samples, 92% (69/75) were PCR negative and 8% (6/75) were PCR positive. The percentages of CD117(+)CD34(-)CD123(+)HLA-DR(-) cells in 116 consecutive specimens and 117 specimens of mCR were related to PML/RARalpha quantified by real-time PCR (r = 0.824, P < 0.001 and r = 0.754, P < 0.001 respectively).

We demonstrate here that multiple promoter elements mediate LIF stimulation of M(2) gene transcription. We identify a LIF inducible element (LIE) in the M(2) promoter with high homology to a cytokine-inducible ACTG-containing sequence in the vasoactive intestinal peptide promoter. Mutagenesis of both a STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) element and the LIE in the M(2) promoter is required to attenuate stimulation of M(2) promoter activity by LIF completely. Mobility shift assays indicate that a LIF-stimulated complex binds to a 70 base pair M(2) promoter fragment. Furthermore, a STAT element within this fragment can bind to LIF-stimulated nuclear STAT1 homodimers in vitro. Mutagenesis experiments show that cytokine-stimulated activation of M(2) promoter activity requires tyrosine residues on glycoprotein 130 (gp130) that are also required for both STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Dominant negative STAT1 or STAT3 can block LIF-stimulated M(2) promoter activity. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicates that LIF-stimulated induction of M(2) mRNA is partially dependent on protein synthesis. These results show that regulation of M(2) gene transcription in neuronal cells by LIF occurs through a complex novel mechanism that is dependent on LIE, STAT and de novo protein synthesis.","['Laszlo, George S', 'Rosoff, Marc L', 'Amieux, Paul S', 'Nathanson, Neil M']","['Laszlo GS', 'Rosoff ML', 'Amieux PS', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, 98195-7750, USA.']",,['eng'],"['GM07108/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07727/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS26920/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2006/06/28 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC3976 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03976.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2006 Aug;98(4):1302-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03976.x.

Recently, we demonstrated that low levels of soluble (s) CD137L and high levels of sCD178 correlate significantly with a long progression free survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study, we correlated sCD137L and sCD178 levels in sera of 42 samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 46 samples of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with stages, subtypes, and the clinical course of the diseases and determined cut-off values with maximum probability for significant differentiation between cases with higher/lower probability for progress free survival. In contrast to patients with MDS, surprisingly no correlation between sCD178 levels and different subtypes and stages or with prognosis in AML or NHL were observed. Regarding sCD137L, NHL-patients displayed lower levels compared with AML. Statistically significant higher median levels of sCD137L are present in patients with undifferentiated AML (M1/M2, 1,470 pg/mL), poor cytogenetic risk (288 pg/mL) and higher levels of BM-blasts (186 pg/mL) compared with patients with monocytoid AML (M4/M5, 89 pg/mL), intermediate cytogenetic risk (59 pg/mL) and lower levels of BM-blasts (14 pg/mL) respectively. Furthermore, in AML patients sCD137L levels correlate significantly with the probabilities to achieve complete remission (CR), stay in CR or with progress of the disease. Taken together, our data demonstrate that sCD137L can be used as a prognostic factor not only in MDS but also in AML.","['Hentschel, N', 'Krusch, M', 'Kiener, P A', 'Kolb, H J', 'Salih, H R', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Hentschel N', 'Krusch M', 'Kiener PA', 'Kolb HJ', 'Salih HR', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Medical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TNFSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blast Crisis/blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Solubility', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*blood']",2006/06/28 09:00,2006/09/14 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH679 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00679.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Aug;77(2):91-101. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00679.x.

We previously identified a gene (NES1) that is expressed in normal but not in transformed mammary epithelial cells (MECs). NES1 is located on chromosome 19q13.4 within the kallikrein locus and thus was designated as human kallikrein 10 (hK10), although we have been unable to detect any protease activity. Importantly, hK10 expression is decreased in a majority of breast cancer cell lines. Transfection of hK10 into hK10-negative breast cancer cells reduces the tumorigenicity. Using methylation-specific PCR and subsequent sequencing, we demonstrate a strong correlation between hypermethylation of hK10 and loss of mRNA expression. Further analysis showed that essentially 100% of normal breast specimens had hK10 expression, whereas 46% of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and the majority of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples lacked the hK10 mRNA. Importantly, hK10-negative DCIS diagnosed at the time of biopsy were subsequently diagnosed as IDC at the time of definitive surgery. It has been shown that hK10 protein expression is regulated by steroids. In addition to breast cancers, hK10 is downregulated in cervical cancer, prostate cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia, whereas it is upregulated in ovarian cancers. These results point to the paradoxical role of hK10 in human cancers and underscore the importance of further studies of this kallikrein.","['Zhang, Ying', 'Bhat, Ishfaq', 'Zeng, Musheng', 'Jayal, Goyal', 'Wazer, David E', 'Band, Hamid', 'Band, Vimla']","['Zhang Y', 'Bhat I', 'Zeng M', 'Jayal G', 'Wazer DE', 'Band H', 'Band V']","['Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Medicine, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute and Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 1001 University Place, Evanston, IL 60201, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA 76118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 99163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 99900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (KLK10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Kallikreins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kallikreins/*analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasms', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2006/06/28 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/06/28 09:00'],"['2006/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/BC.2006.090 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2006 Jun;387(6):715-21. doi: 10.1515/BC.2006.090.,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether activation of CAR may also protect against liver injury by directly blocking apoptosis is unknown. To address this question, CAR wild-type (CAR+/+) and CAR knockout (CAR-/-) mice were treated with the CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) and then with the Fas agonist Jo2 or with concanavalin A (ConA). Following the administration of Jo2, hepatocyte apoptosis, liver injury, and animal fatalities were abated in TCPOBOP-treated CAR+/+ but not in CAR-/- mice. Likewise, acute and chronic ConA-mediated liver injury and fibrosis were also reduced in wild-type versus CAR(-/-) TCPOBOP-treated mice. The proapoptotic proteins Bak (Bcl-2 antagonistic killer) and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) were depleted in livers from TCPOBOP-treated CAR+/+ mice. In contrast, mRNA expression of the antiapoptotic effector myeloid cell leukemia factor-1 (Mcl-1) was increased fourfold. Mcl-1 promoter activity was increased by transfection with CAR and administration of TCPOBOP in hepatoma cells, consistent with a direct CAR effect on Mcl-1 transcription. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis of a putative CAR consensus binding sequence on the Mcl-1 promoter decreased Mcl-1 promoter activity. Mcl-1 transgenic animals demonstrated little to no acute liver injury after administration of Jo2, signifying Mcl-1 cytoprotection. In conclusion, these observations support a prominent role for CAR cytoprotection against Fas-mediated hepatocyte injury via a mechanism involving upregulation of Mcl-1 and, likely, downregulation of Bax and Bak.","['Baskin-Bey, Edwina S', 'Huang, Wendong', 'Ishimura, Norihisa', 'Isomoto, Hajime', 'Bronk, Steven F', 'Braley, Karen', 'Craig, Ruth W', 'Moore, David D', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Baskin-Bey ES', 'Huang W', 'Ishimura N', 'Isomoto H', 'Bronk SF', 'Braley K', 'Craig RW', 'Moore DD', 'Gores GJ']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['F32 DK063780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46546/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07198/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Constitutive Androstane Receptor)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '76150-91-9 (1,4-bis(2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy))benzene)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Concanavalin A/toxicity', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Diseases/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Transcription Factors/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/toxicity']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.21236 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2006 Jul;44(1):252-62. doi: 10.1002/hep.21236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported results comparable to the literature as regards ANLL both in pediatric and adult cases. However, higher figures were encountered for the functional assay in ALL. As our ALL cases especially in pediatric age group show worse prognosis compared to literature, we hypothesized that the higher percentage of cases with positive Rh123 efflux assay might be a contributing factor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 108 cases were studied including 80 ALL and 28 ANLL. ALL cases included 48 male and 32 female with an age range of 6m to 18 yrs and a median of 7 yrs. ANLL cases included 18 male and 10 female with an age range of 6m to 18 yrs and a median of 8 yrs. P-gp expression was evaluated using 4E3 and UIC2 mAb, analyzed by Coulter XL flow cytometer and expressed as a ratio at a cut off of >or= 1.1 and/or >or= 5% positive cells. For the evaluation of MDR function Rh123 efflux assay using cyclosporine as a blocker and expressed as a ratio at a cutoff of >or= 1.1 and/or >or= 10% positive cells was performed. MDR expression and function were correlated to age, Hb, TLC, CD34 expression, immunophenotype and DNA index in ALL, FAB subtypes in ANLL as well as to CR, DFS and EFS in ALL. RESULTS: In ALL, P-gp expression was encountered in 26.4% of cases. Positive Rh efflux was reported in 61.5%. No correlation was encountered between neither expression nor functional assay with age, Hb, TLC, CD34 expression or immunophenotype. CR was achieved in 89.8%; neither P-gp expression nor Rh123 efflux had an impact on CR except for Rh123 efflux in T-ALL where a cutoff of 1.25 could predict CR at a total accuracy of 70.6%. DFS was 92.3% while EFS was 72.2% for the whole group. No significant difference was encountered neither between cases expressing or lacking P-gp nor between cases with negative or positive Rh123 efflux assay. In ANLL P-gp expression was encountered in 47.6% of cases, while positive Rh123 efflux assay was encountered in 75% of cases. No correlation as encountered between neither expression nor Rh123 efflux assay and neither age, Hb, TLC, CD34 expression nor FAB subtypes. CONCLUSION: Neither P-gp expression nor Rh123 efflux assay has any impact on survival in pediatric ALL. Rh123 ratio of 1.25 is predictive of CR in TALL.","['Kamel, Azza M', 'El-Sharkawy, Nahla', 'Yassin, Dina', 'Shaaban, Khaled', 'Hussein, Hany', 'Sidhom, Iman', 'Abo El-Naga, Sherif', 'Ameen, Manal', 'El-Hattab, Omer', 'Aly El-Din, Nelly H']","['Kamel AM', 'El-Sharkawy N', 'Yassin D', 'Shaaban K', 'Hussein H', 'Sidhom I', 'Abo El-Naga S', 'Ameen M', 'El-Hattab O', 'Aly El-Din NH']","['The Department of Clinical Pathology, NCI, Cairo University.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', '*Rhodamine 123', 'Survival Rate']",2006/06/27 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2005 Sep;17(3):165-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) plays an important role in the maintenance/growth and differentiation of the metanephric blastema, and constitutively activated STATs facilitate neoplastic behaviors of a variety of cancers, we hypothesized that dysregulation of STAT signaling may also contribute to WT pathogenesis. Accordingly, we evaluated STAT phosphorylation patterns in tumors and found that STAT1 was constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727 (S727) in 19 of 21 primary WT samples and two WT cell lines. An inactivating mutation of S727 to alanine reduced colony formation of WT cells in soft agar by more than 80% and induced apoptosis under conditions of growth stress. S727-phosphorylated STAT1 provided apoptotic resistance for WT cells via upregulation of expression of the heat-shock protein (HSP)27 and antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1. The kinase responsible for STAT1 S727 phosphorylation in WT cells was identified based upon the use of selective inhibitors as protein kinase CK2, not p38, MAP-kinase kinase (MEK)1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, protein kinase C or Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). The inhibition of CK2 blocked the anchorage-independent growth of WT cells and induced apoptosis under conditions of growth stress. Our findings suggest that serine-phosphorylated STAT1, as a downstream target of protein kinase CK2, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of WT and possibly other neoplasms with similar STAT1 phosphorylation patterns.","['Timofeeva, O A', 'Plisov, S', 'Evseev, A A', 'Peng, S', 'Jose-Kampfner, M', 'Lovvorn, H N', 'Dome, J S', 'Perantoni, A O']","['Timofeeva OA', 'Plisov S', 'Evseev AA', 'Peng S', 'Jose-Kampfner M', 'Lovvorn HN', 'Dome JS', 'Perantoni AO']","['Laboratory of Comparative Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",,['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Casein Kinase II/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Wilms Tumor/*metabolism/pathology']",2006/06/27 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209742 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209742 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Dec 7;25(58):7555-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209742.

The oncoprotein has the capacity to promote expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induces leukemia in association with other genetic alterations. Here, we show that RUNX1-ETO undergoes degradation in response to treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors, one of which, depsipeptide (DEP), is currently undergoing phase II clinical testing in a variety of malignancies. These compounds induce turnover of RUNX1-ETO without affecting the stability of RUNX1-ETO partner proteins. In addition, RUNX1-ETO physically interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). DEP treatment interrupts the association of RUNX1-ETO with HSP90 and induces proteasomal degradation of RUNX1-ETO. DEP and the HSP90 antagonist 17-allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG) both triggered RUNX1-ETO degradation, but without any additive or cooperative effects. These findings may stimulate the development of more rational and effective approaches for treating t(8;21) patients using histone deacetylase inhibitors or HSP90 inhibitors.","['Yang, G', 'Thompson, M A', 'Brandt, S J', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Yang G', 'Thompson MA', 'Brandt SJ', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/06/27 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209760 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209760 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jan 4;26(1):91-101. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209760.

Few investigations into the regulation of these enzymes by physiological stimuli have been reported. In this study, we investigated the influence of interferons (IFNs) type I (alpha, beta) and II (gamma) on ACE and TACE expression of human leukemic NB4 cells and monocytes. We assessed the expression of proteases by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence analyses. IFNgamma, but not type I IFNs, upregulated membrane ACE in a dose- and time-dependency and this was reflected by the increase of ACE enzymatic activity and ACE mRNA. ACE upregulation was dependent on protein synthesis. Treatment of the interferon responsive factor 1 (IRF1)-unresponsive HepG2 cell line with IFNgamma did not affect ACE expression, thus suggesting the participation of the IRF1 signaling pathway in IFNgamma-mediated ACE upregulation in myeloid cells. In contrast, both types of IFNs, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, downregulated surface TACE without affecting TACE transcript. Soluble TACE was not detected in the medium of IFN-treated cells. IFNgamma-mediated decrease of surface TACE in NB4 cells was reversible, and correlated with an increase in intracellular TACE, suggesting that cell surface TACE was internalized in response to IFNs. These findings, showing the presence of IFN-dependent controlled mechanisms by which ACE and TACE levels are regulated in human normal and leukemic myeloid cells, may have implications in the context of current investigations on the therapeutic potential of IFNs.","['Obeid, D', 'Nguyen, J', 'Lesavre, P', 'Bauvois, B']","['Obeid D', 'Nguyen J', 'Lesavre P', 'Bauvois B']","['INSERM 507, Hopital Necker, Batiment Lavoisier, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Monocytes/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2006/06/27 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209779 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209779 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jan 4;26(1):102-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209779.

We are developing immunotherapy approaches based on administration of large numbers of ex vivo interferon-gamma-activated macrophages to cancer patients. With a quantitative assay measuring killing of nonproliferating tumor cells, we evaluated whether, in physiologic conditions, these macrophages synergize with the anti-CD20 Ab rituximab for killing primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. ADCC reached levels of 70% to 80% at effector to target ratios as low as 1:1. Macrophage recruitment by Ab-opsonized tumor cells did not result in enhanced cytokine secretion, suggesting that the cytokine shower observed in rituximab-treated patients is not caused by macrophage activation, and that cytokines have no role in CLL killing. We observed that uptake of tumor material by macrophages was not directly correlated to tumor killing. Nonetheless, experiments in the presence of cytochalasin D showed that ADCC occurred mainly by phagocytosis. Tumor killing was largely mediated by Fc gammaRI and inhibited by increasing concentration of serum. Importantly, complement deposition on B-CLL cells did not seem to enhance macrophage ADCC in this model, as complement-depleted and complement-repleted human plasmas exerted comparable inhibition.","['Lefebvre, Marie-Laure', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Salcedo, Margarita', 'Nardin, Alessandra']","['Lefebvre ML', 'Krause SW', 'Salcedo M', 'Nardin A']","['IDM, 172 rue de Charonne, 75011 Paris, France.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology', 'Rituximab', 'Serum/physiology']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cji.0000203081.43235.d7 [doi]', '00002371-200607000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2006 Jul-Aug;29(4):388-97. doi: 10.1097/01.cji.0000203081.43235.d7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the rearrangements of B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL6 and Paired homeobox 5 (PAX5) genes in Indonesian follicular lymphoma (FL) patients. METHODS: We examined gene rearrangements using various kinds of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) on 24 patients' peripheral blood DNA. RESULTS: BCL2 rearrangement was found in 58% (14 of 24 patients), 8 at mbr (major breakpoint region), 2 at mcr (minor cluster region) and 4 at icr (intermediate cluster region), respectively. No rearrangement in BCL6 and PAX5 was detected. There was a significant difference in the incidence of spleen involvement between patients with BCL-2 rearrangement and without it (50% vs. 11%, p=0.04). BCL-2 rearrangement was correlated with spleen involvement (OR=9) and anemia (OR=2.3). CONCLUSION: BCL2 rearrangement in Indonesian FL was higher than previous reports from other Asia countries (58% vs. 48%, respectively). Our method using peripheral blood DNA might be useful for the molecular diagnosis of FL.","['Oehadian, Amaylia', 'Koide, Naoki', 'Fianza, Pandji Irani', 'Fadjari, Trinugroho Heri', 'Sumantri, Rachmat', 'Supandiman, Iman', 'Yokochi, Takashi']","['Oehadian A', 'Koide N', 'Fianza PI', 'Fadjari TH', 'Sumantri R', 'Supandiman I', 'Yokochi T']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal medicine, Padjadjaran University, Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Indonesia,Acta Med Indones,Acta medica Indonesiana,7901042,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,"['Anemia/epidemiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Splenic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['040579197 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Med Indones. 2006 Apr-Jun;38(2):72-6.,,,,['Acta Med Indones. 2006 Apr-Jun;38(2):65-6.

The hallmark of these translocations is the ectopic activation of a silent proto-oncogene through its relocation at the vicinity of an active regulatory element.

Recent progress in the understanding of the V(D)J recombination process has allowed a more accurate definition of the translocation mechanisms involved, and has revealed that V(D)J-mediated translocations result both from targeting mistakes of the recombinase, and from illegitimate repair of the V(D)J recombination intermediates.

Ovarian cryopreservation is a research way for fertility restoration on patients who will have gonadotoxic treatment. The aim of our work was to study the cases of ovarian tissue preserved in our Department, enabling us to assess the clinical and ethical problems of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from January 2001 onwards up to October 2005, on 14 patients, whose ovarian cortex was frozen our the University Fertility Center (Hopital de la Conception, Marseille, France). RESULTS: In our study, the patients' average age was 17+/-5.5 and the median was 14 years [13-24]. Eight patients were under 18 (11+/-3-years-old). The cryopreservation indications were especially haematological (N = 9). More than half of the patients (N = 8) had undergone a gonadotoxic treatment before ovarian cryopreservation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Ovarian cryopreservation is still a recent technology in reproductive medicine. The future of ovarian tissue after thawing, with its different techniques of autograft, is still not consensual. Experimental research remains essential to improve the freezing protocols and ovarian transplant in human medicine.","['Courbiere, B', 'Porcu, G', 'Saias-Magnan, J', 'Guillemain, C', 'Noizet, A', 'Michel, G', 'Grillo, J-M', 'Gamerre, M']","['Courbiere B', 'Porcu G', 'Saias-Magnan J', 'Guillemain C', 'Noizet A', 'Michel G', 'Grillo JM', 'Gamerre M']","[""Centre d'Assistance medicale a la procreation, hopital de la Conception, 147, boulevard Baille, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France. blandine.courbiere@ap-hm.fr""]",,['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Gynecol Obstet Fertil,"Gynecologie, obstetrique & fertilite",100936305,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryopreservation/*ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/etiology/surgery', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Ovary/*physiology/transplantation', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1297-9589(06)00186-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.gyobfe.2006.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Obstet Fertil. 2006 Jul-Aug;34(7-8):607-14. doi: 10.1016/j.gyobfe.2006.05.007.

Increasing evidence indicates that inflammatory responses in the central nervous system are not exclusively detrimental, but may also exert protective effects. Such protective effects are potentially mediated by the local secretion of neurotrophic factors by immune cells. We previously reported that T cells and monocytes in vitro and in inflammatory MS lesions produce leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the neuropoietic family of neurotrophins. In the present study, we report a reduced LIF production by CD4+ T cells of relapsing remitting MS patients as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, immunomodulatory agents such as leptin, IFN-beta and simvastatin were studied for their potential to alter LIF and secretion of other cytokines by T cells and monocytes of relapsing remitting MS patients and healthy controls. Low doses of simvastatin, but not IFN-beta or leptin enhanced LIF secretion by CD4+ T cells of RR-MS patients. We further demonstrated that LIF did not influence viability, proliferation and cytokine secretion of T cells. Together these data provide new information on the regulation of LIF secretion by immune cells. Further insights into the complex regulation of neurotrophic factors such as LIF may prove useful for treatment of MS.","['Vanderlocht, Joris', 'Hendriks, Jerome J A', 'Venken, Koen', 'Stinissen, Piet', 'Hellings, Niels']","['Vanderlocht J', 'Hendriks JJ', 'Venken K', 'Stinissen P', 'Hellings N']","['Hasselt University, Biomedical Research Institute and Transnational Universiteit Limburg, School of Life Sciences, Diepenbeek, Belgium.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects/immunology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis/blood/*immunology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/immunology/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/10/27 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(06)00145-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jneuroim.2006.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 2006 Aug;177(1-2):189-200. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2006.04.012.

Thus, we asked whether the stability of c-Myb in leukemic cells might be enhanced by mutations interfering with its degradation. We analyzed the c-myb gene in 133 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase and/or blast crisis by denaturing-high performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) and sequence analysis of PCR products corresponding to the entire coding sequence and each exon-intron boundary. No mutations were found. We found four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and identified an alternatively spliced transcript lacking exon 5, but SNPs frequency and expression of the alternatively spliced transcript were identical in normal and CML cells.

METHODS: Donor/recipient pairs included MHC fully mismatched, MHC haplomismatched, and MiHA mismatched strain combinations. T cell-depleted BM (TCD-BM) was transplanted in combination with untreated, fludarabine-treated, 7.5-Gy gamma-irradiated, or psoralen/UVA (PUVA)-treated splenocytes. GVL activity was studied by adding a lethal number of recipient-type lymphoma cells. Posttransplant survival was determined, and GVHD and GVL activity were assessed by clinical and pathological scoring. Hematopoietic chimerism and donor T-cell expansion were analyzed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples at 30 and 60 days posttransplant. RESULTS: Allogeneic splenocytes treated with fludarabine, 7.5 Gy gamma-irradiation, or PUVA had significantly diminished GVHD activity, and all treated donor T cells facilitated engraftment by low-dose TCD-BM. Allogeneic splenocytes treated with fludarabine and, to a lesser extent, PUVA retained GVL activity and contributed more to donor T-cell chimerism compared to gamma-irradiated donor splenocytes. CONCLUSION: Among ex vivo methods of treating donor T cells to limit their proliferative capacity, fludarabine exposure had the greatest differential ability to inhibit the GVHD activity of allogeneic lymphocytes, while preserving their GVL activity and ability to engraft recipients. Thus, ex vivo treatment with fludarabine was superior to gamma-irradiation or PUVA in separating GVL from GVHD activity in murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Li, Jian-Ming', 'Giver, Cynthia R', 'Waller, Edmund K']","['Li JM', 'Giver CR', 'Waller EK']","['Emory University, Winship Cancer Institute, Hematology/Oncology, Atlanta, Ga., USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA-74364-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00195-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Jul;34(7):895-904. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.03.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, B7-H1 on murine leukemia cells was reported to mediate resistance to cytolytic T-cell destruction. We here investigate the expression and function of the B7 homolog B7-H1 in human leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Leukemia cells from 30 patients and 9 human leukemia cell lines were investigated for B7-H1 expression by flow cytometry. Functional relevance of B7-H1 for tumor-immune interactions was assessed by coculture experiments using purified, alloreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells in the presence of a neutralizing anti-B7-H1 antibody. RESULTS: Significant B7-H1 expression levels on leukemia cells were detected in 17 of 30 patients and in eight of nine cell lines. In contrast to various other tumor entities and the data reported from a murine leukemia system, no significant inhibitory effect of leukemia-derived B7-H1 on CD4 and CD8 cytokine production (IFN-gamma, IL-2), proliferation or expression of T-cell activation markers (ICOS, CD69) was observed. Furthermore, in the presence of neutralizing B7-H1 antibody (mAb 5H1) occurred no significant changes in T cell IFN-gamma or IL-2 production or proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that leukemia-derived B7-H1 seems to have no direct influence on T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production in humans. Further experiments are warranted to delineate factors and characterize yet-unidentified B7-H1 receptor(s) that determine inhibitory and stimulatory functions of B7-H1 in human leukemia.","['Salih, Helmut Rainer', 'Wintterle, Sabine', 'Krusch, Matthias', 'Kroner, Antje', 'Huang, Yu-Hwa', 'Chen, Lieping', 'Wiendl, Heinz']","['Salih HR', 'Wintterle S', 'Krusch M', 'Kroner A', 'Huang YH', 'Chen L', 'Wiendl H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology II, University of Tuebingen, Germany.

In this study we wanted to explore whether CD229 might function as B-CLL-specific tumor-associated antigen (TAA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous, CD229-specific HLA-A2-restricted T cells were identified using IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assays and HLA-A2/dimer-peptide staining after 4 weeks of in vitro culture. RESULTS: We were able to expand autologous T cells from 9/11 B-CLL patients using native B-CLL cells as antigen presenting cells (APCs) in 5 cases, whereas for 4 samples an autologous T-cell response could only be evoked by use of CD40L-stimulated B-CLL cells as APCs. The number of CD8+ T cells could be expanded during 4 weeks of in vitro culture with native or CD40L-activated B-CLL cells while the amount of specific T cells recognizing CD229 peptides bound to HLA-A2 dimers increased on average 12-fold (native CLL) and 13-fold (CD40L-activated CLL), respectively. Using IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assays we could demonstrate that the expanded T cells were able to secrete IFN-gamma upon recognition of the antigen. These T cells not only recognized HLA-A0201-binding CD229-derived peptides presented by T2 cells, but also CD229-overexpressing autologous B-CLL cells in an MHC-I-restricted manner.

Using L5178Y cells.,125-52,"In this report, results are presented from an international study of the in vitro micronucleus assay using mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. This study was coordinated by an organizing committee supported by the SFTG (the French branch of the European Environmental Mutagen Society). Test chemicals included mannitol, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, colchicine and griseofulvin. Mitomycin C was used as a positive control. Each chemical was evaluated in at least two laboratories following a variety of different protocols (short and long exposures, varying recovery times, with and without cytochalasin B) in order to help determine a standard protocol for routine testing in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. Mannitol was the only exception, being tested in only one laboratory. Mannitol was negative, while bleomycin induced a concentration-dependent increase in micronucleated cells. Equivocal results were obtained for 5-fluorouracil, colchicine and griseofulvin. High levels of cytotoxicity interfered with the assessment of aneuploidy for colchicine and griseofulvin, preventing the ability to obtain clear results in all the treatment schedules. Experiments with 5-fluorouracil, colchicine and griseofulvin showed that both short and long treatment times are required as each compound was detected using one or more treatment protocol.

METHODS: K562 cel1s were incubated with Celecoxib of the concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 micromol/L for 36 hours, the cell vitality was determined by MTT assay, the early apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry (FC). The percentage of annexin V positive was detected by FC so as to evaluate the early apoptosis. The expression of PRb and P27(Kip) protein was detected by Western blotting. Another K562 cells were incubated with Celecoxib of the concentration of 40 micromol/L, Imatinib of the concentration of 0.2 micromol/L, or Celecoxib 40 micromol/L + Imatinib 0.2 micromol/L for 36 hours. Then the cell vitality and early apoptosis of the cells were detected so as to evaluate the synergistic effects of the combination of Celecoxib and Imatinib. RESULTS: Celecoxib inhibited the K562 cells vitality significantly in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic rate of K562 cells was elevated with the increasing Celecoxib concentration. Celecoxib down-regulated the expression of PRb protein and up-regulated the expression of P27(Kip) protein in the K562 cells. The combination of Celecoxib and Imatinib exhibited evidently synergistic effects in terms of anti-proliferation on K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis on leukemic cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The anti-proliferation effect of Celecoxib may be associated with the down-regulation of PRb expression and up-regulation of P27(Kip) expression.

The aim of this study is to carry out a large-scale screening for the HBV integrations sites in HCC samples from Chinese patients. METHODS: Cellular DNA was extracted from 40 HBV-related HCC by proteinase K digestion/phenol extraction method. One primer specific to HBV sequence and another primer directed to human Alu repeat were used to amplify the virus/cellular DNA junction. To avoid undesirable amplifications between Alu sequences, primers were constructed with dUTPs and destroyed by uracil DNA glycosylase treatment after 15 initial cycles of amplification. Only desirable fragments were then further amplified with specific primers to the known region and to a tag sequence introduced in the Alu-Specific primer. The PCR product was purified and subject to direct sequencing by ABI 3700 Auto sequencer. NCBI (national center for biotechnology information) BLAST and MapViewer search were used for identification of HBV location on human genomes. RESULTS: In 40 HBsAg positive HCC samples, 34 (85%) were showed to have at least one copy of HBV fragment in host genome, indicating HBV-Alu-PCR is a rapid way for identification of new cellular DNA sequences adjacent to HBV. Analysis from the 68 isolated viral-cellular junctions, X gene was found to be interrupted at any length, not specifically at DR1 and DR2 regions. Three-prime-deleted X gene was observed in 65 (96%) cases. HBV preferred to integrate into the intron and the up-stream regulatory region of the cellular genes. In no case HBV inserted into the exon. Our results also demonstrated that the cellular genes targeted by HBV are usually key regulators of cell proliferation and cell death. Three genes, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 4, G protein alpha transducing activity polypeptide 1 and fibronectin, were found to be recurrently targeted by HBV. CONCLUSION: HBV-Alu-PCR is a powerful tool for the study of HBV integration sites. Truncated X is a major form existed in the HBV integrants. HBV integration is not distributed evenly throughout the host genome and viral insertional mutagenesis may play an important role in the development of HCC.","['Tu, Hong', 'Gao, Hai-feng', 'Ma, Guo-ha', 'Liu, Yi']","['Tu H', 'Gao HF', 'Ma GH', 'Liu Y']","['Shanghai Cancer Institute, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, Shanghai 200032, China. tuhong66@yahoo.com']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Alu Elements/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*genetics/virology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Virus Integration']",2006/06/27 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 May 16;86(18):1249-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four patients fulfilling clinico-pathologic criteria for Sweet's syndrome seen during May-August 2002 prompted us to review reports on Indian patients from the indexed literature. METHODS: A PubMed and IndMed search for Sweet's syndrome revealed 11 reports appearing between 1985-2002 documenting 12 patients. The clinico-pathologic features, clinical course and treatment of all these 16 patients (including four new cases) were studied. RESULTS: The study comprised 12 females and four males between 35 days to 57 years of age. There were four children of < 12 years. Ulcerated, crusted lesions in one and typical, erythematous, tender, papulo-nodulo-plaques and targetoid lesions with pseudovesiculation were observed in 13 other patients particularly involving head, neck and upper limbs. Extracutaneous Sweet's syndrome manifesting as gingival hyperplasia and myositis was seen in one patient each. All had simultaneous onset of cutaneous lesions, fever, headache and malaise. Ocular involvement was observed in four patients only. Associated hematoligic disorders recorded were myelodysplasia in three, polycythemia vera in one and leukemia in three patients respectively. Two of these patients had treatment with all-transretinoic acid and low-dose cytosine-arbinoside before onset of Sweet's syndrome. One patient each had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and history of minor injury prior to cutaneous lesions. Another patient had pregnancy induced self-limiting Sweet's syndrome. Leukocytosis was present in 11 patients. Three of four new patients had positive tests for antistreptolysin-O and C-reactive protein. Characteristics histologic features were recorded in specimens of all patients. Eleven patients responded to systemic corticosteroids.

The active, dynamic, and timely prognosis of an unfavourable outcome represents a solid basis for the individual adaptation of antileukaemic and supportive therapy. A part of the ANLL NS 03 programme for the individualised therapy of acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia in patients no older than 60 years will be described. The programme is based on a network of prognostic models, identifying predictors and preventive measures against an unfavourable outcome. The crucial point of the ANLL NS 03 programme is to determine the optimal timing for the transplantation of allogeneic and autologous haematopoietic stem cells. Indicators of early death include the age of the patient, infection, and hemorrhagic syndrome. According to our models, the predictors of fatal bleeding and fatal infection are hyperleukocytosis, leucopenia, and granulocytopenia, respectively. Resistance to cytostatics can be predicted on day 14 from the onset of therapy using two original cytological-mathematical parameters: the absolute blast count (ABC) forming the intensity dimension, and parameter S forming the selectivity dimension, of the early effects of the first induction treatment. The ABC and S values determine the structure and timing of the second induction treatment. Transplantation of autologous and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells within the ANLL NS 03 programme is applied selectively during the early stages of the first remission in patients at high risk of an early relapse. Predictors of early relapse are leukocyte counts higher than 30x10(9)/l, remission induction during the second treatment, and the presence of myelodysplasia. In all other patient categories and in patients with cytogenetically favourable forms of acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia, transplantation is postponed until the second remission of the disease.","['Popovic, Stevan L']",['Popovic SL'],,,['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy']",2006/06/27 09:00,2006/08/24 09:00,['2006/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/sarh06s1072p [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2006 May;134 Suppl 1:72-7. doi: 10.2298/sarh06s1072p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available data are limited by patient numbers and coexisting pathologies. METHODS: The authors report on the use of immunosuppressants (cyclosporin A [CSA] and low-dose oral methotrexate [MTX] given continuously) and cytotoxic agents in the treatment of 29 patients with T-cell LGL leukemia age over the past 20 years. RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) to MTX (n = 8 patients) was 85.7% (complete hematologic response [CHR] rate, 14.3%; partial response [PR] rate, 71.4%) with dose-dependent responses observed and safe usage of doses >10 mg/m2 per week in 2 patients. The ORR to CSA (n = 23 patients) was 78.2% (CHR rate, 30.4%; PR rate, 47.8%). The median time to response for both agents was 1 month. Toxicity, although it was minor in most patients and was more common in the CSA group, included second malignancies in 5 patients. An ORR of 67% (all CHR) was attained with pentostatin (n = 4 patients); recurrences developed after a median of 4.6 years. Successful retreatment with pentostatin was possible but with increasing drug resistance. Cyclophosphamide induced CHR that lasted >7 years with bone marrow clearance in 1 of 4 patients. Alemtuzumab induced a PR in 1 patient who had refractory disease. CONCLUSIONS: Both MTX and CSA were efficacious in the treatment of T-cell LGL leukemia but generally required long-term maintenance therapy. The authors highlight the risks of second malignancies and persistence of bone marrow disease. Although MTX and CSA were effective as first-line therapy, alemtuzumab and pentostatin merit further investigation, particularly for refractory disease.","['Osuji, Nnenna', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir', 'Grech, Henri', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Swansbury, John G', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Osuji N', 'Matutes E', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Grech H', 'Del Giudice I', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Swansbury JG', 'Catovsky D']","['Section of Haemato-oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. nnenna.osuji@icr.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Databases as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22032 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Aug 1;107(3):570-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22032.,41,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,['Cancer. 2006 Dec 1;107(11):2744'],,,,,,

Twenty-six patients developed a secondary malignancy with an overall risk of 1.7% in this cohort. The male:female ratio was 17:10, with a median age of 7.66 at diagnosis (range, 2 to 16 y). Four patients (14.8%) with Hodgkin lymphoma; 3 each (11.1%) with retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; 2 each (7.4%) with Wilms tumor, Ewing sarcoma, medulloblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; and 1 each (3.7%) with ependymoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, astrocytoma had a secondary malignant disease during the long-term follow-up period. Secondary malignant diseases were osteosarcoma in 6 patients, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2, acute myelogenous leukemia in 2, and rare malignant disease in others. Four patients with osteosarcoma developed disease within the radiation field. Osteosarcoma was the most frequently occurring secondary neoplasm. Less toxic treatment modalities should be used to decrease the risk of secondary malignant diseases.","['Caglar, Kudret', 'Varan, Ali', 'Akyuz, Canan', 'Selek, Ugur', 'Kutluk, Tezer', 'Yalcin, Bilgehan', 'Atahan, I Lale', 'Buyukpamukcu, Munevver']","['Caglar K', 'Varan A', 'Akyuz C', 'Selek U', 'Kutluk T', 'Yalcin B', 'Atahan IL', 'Buyukpamukcu M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. caglar@tr.net']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*mortality/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200606000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/00043426-200606000-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2006 Jun;28(6):374-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200606000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pre-BCR signaling pathway for this process is largely unknown but may involve the adaptor protein BASH (BLNK/SLP-65). Here we report that the pre-B leukemia cell lines established from affected BASH-deficient mice rearrange kappaL-chain gene locus and down-regulate pre-BCR upon PMA treatment or BASH reconstitution. Analyses with specific inhibitors revealed that activation of novel PKC (nPKC) and MEK, but not Ras, is necessary for the rearrangement. Accordingly, retroviral transduction of active PKCeta, PKCepsilon, or Raf-1, but not Ras, induced the kappa gene rearrangement and expression in the pre-B-cell line. Tamoxifen-mediated BASH reconstitution resulted in the translocation of PKCeta to the plasma membrane and kappa chain expression. These data make evident that the Ras-independent BASH-nPKC-Raf-1 pathway of pre-BCR signaling induces the L-chain gene rearrangement and expression.","['Yamamoto, Mutsumi', 'Hayashi, Katsuhiko', 'Nojima, Takuya', 'Matsuzaki, Yumi', 'Kawano, Yohei', 'Karasuyama, Hajime', 'Goitsuka, Ryo', 'Kitamura, Daisuke']","['Yamamoto M', 'Hayashi K', 'Nojima T', 'Matsuzaki Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Karasuyama H', 'Goitsuka R', 'Kitamura D']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Research Institute for Biological Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Yamazaki 2669, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Preleukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52456-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-024968 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 15;108(8):2703-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-024968.

Cancer in adolescents and young adults is unique in the distribution of the types that occur. Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, testis cancer, female genital tract malignancies, thyroid cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain and spinal cord tumors, breast cancer, bone sarcomas, and nongonadal germ cell tumors account for 95% of the cancers in this age group. The frequency distribution of cancer types changes dramatically from age 15-30, such that the pattern at the youngest age does not resemble the one at the oldest. The incidence of cancer in this age group increased steadily during the past quarter century. This increase is declining and at the older end of the age range appears to be returning to the incidence of the 1970s. Males in the 15- to 29-year age group have been at higher risk of developing cancer, with the risk directly proportional to age. Non-Hispanic whites have had the highest risk of developing cancer during this phase of life, and Asians, American Indians and Native Alaskans the lowest. Males had a worse prognosis than females. African-Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives had a worse prognosis than white non-Hispanics and Asians. MORTALITY & SURVIVAL: At the beginning of the last quarter century, the diagnosis of cancer in 15- to 29-year-olds carried a more favorable prognosis, on the average, relative to cancer at other ages. Since then, there has been a lack of progress in survival improvement among older adolescents and young adults relative to all other ages. Survival improvement trends portend a worse prognosis for young adults diagnosed with cancer today than 25 years ago. The survival deficit is increasing with longer follow-up of the survivors, and is worse in males. Among 15- to 29-year-olds, non-Hispanic whites had the best survival and African Americans/blacks had the worst survival, with a 20% difference apparent by 5 years. Asians/Pacific Islanders had the second best survival, with Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives next in sequence. RISK FACTORS: In general, there are relatively scant data to support either an environmental causation or an inherited predisposition to cancer in this age group. The majority of cases of cancer occurring before age 30 appear to be spontaneous and unrelated to either carcinogens in the environment or family cancer syndromes. Overall, family cancer syndromes appear to account for less than 5% of the cases of cancer in the age group. Melanoma, cervical carcinoma and Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphomas accounting for the majority of environmentally induced malignancies (ultraviolet light, human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Epstein-Barr virus, respectively). Ultimately, a larger proportion of cases may be attributable to specific factors or genetic predisposition, but at present, most cancer in this age group appears to be sporadic and random.","['Bleyer, Archie', 'Viny, Aaron', 'Barr, Ronald']","['Bleyer A', 'Viny A', 'Barr R']","['Cancer Treatment Center, St. Charles Medical Center, 2500 N.E.

In inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this delayed apoptosis may lead to increased tissue damage and a failure of the inflammation to resolve. However, there are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether neutrophil apoptosis is delayed or accelerated in rheumatoid joints. In this report, we show that neutrophils isolated from the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA show accelerated rates of apoptosis when incubated ex vivo and that SF, despite containing a variety of antiapoptotic cytokines, is proapoptotic. Paradoxically, levels of the key neutrophil survival protein Mcl-1 are elevated in freshly isolated SF neutrophils compared with matched peripheral blood samples from the same patients, indicating that delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been signaled in vivo as the cells enter the joints. However, when SF was added to neutrophils and incubated under hypoxia (1% O(2)), conditions known to exist in vivo within joints, the SF was antiapoptotic. These data reveal that the rheumatoid synovial joint contains a complex mixture of pro- and antiapoptotic factors and that the low, local oxygen tensions that exist within these joints can exert profound effects on neutrophil survival. These experiments also highlight the importance of performing in vitro experiments under laboratory conditions that closely mimic those that occur in vivo; otherwise, misleading conclusions may be drawn.","['Cross, Andrew', 'Barnes, Theresa', 'Bucknall, Roger C', 'Edwards, Steven W', 'Moots, Robert J']","['Cross A', 'Barnes T', 'Bucknall RC', 'Edwards SW', 'Moots RJ']","['Department of Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZB, UK.']",,['eng'],['G0600404/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/immunology', 'Joints/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Oxygen/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*immunology', 'Synovial Fluid/immunology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/immunology']",2006/06/24 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0306178 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0306178 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Sep;80(3):521-8. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0306178.

This peptide, up-regulated under conditions of inflammation, has immunomodulatory and antimicrobial functions. We demonstrate that LL-37 is a potent inhibitor of human neutrophil apoptosis, signaling through P2X(7) receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors other than the formyl peptide receptor-like-1 molecule. This process involved modulation of Mcl-1 expression, inhibition of BID and procaspase-3 cleavage, and the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast to the inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis, LL-37 induced apoptosis in primary airway epithelial cells, demonstrating alternate consequences of LL-37-mediated modulation of apoptotic pathways in different human primary cells. We propose that these novel immunomodulatory properties of LL-37 contribute to peptide-mediated enhancement of innate host defenses against acute infection and are of considerable significance in the development of such peptides and their synthetic analogs as potential therapeutics for use against multiple antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases.","['Barlow, Peter G', 'Li, Yuexin', 'Wilkinson, Thomas S', 'Bowdish, Dawn M E', 'Lau, Y Elaine', 'Cosseau, Celine', 'Haslett, Christopher', 'Simpson, A John', 'Hancock, Robert E W', 'Davidson, Donald J']","['Barlow PG', 'Li Y', 'Wilkinson TS', 'Bowdish DM', 'Lau YE', 'Cosseau C', 'Haslett C', 'Simpson AJ', 'Hancock RE', 'Davidson DJ']","[""MRC/University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, W2.03, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Scotland.""]",,['eng'],['078265/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '3DD771JO2H (ropocamptide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/drug effects/immunology', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",2006/06/24 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1005560 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1005560 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Sep;80(3):509-20. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1005560.

Primitive NSCs [leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) dependent but exogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 independent] can be derived from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro and from embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) to E7.5 epiblast and E7.5-E8.5 neuroectoderm in vivo. Definitive NSCs (LIF independent but FGF2 dependent) first appear in the E8.5 neural plate and persist throughout life. Primitive NSCs give rise to definitive NSCs. Loss and gain of functions were used to study the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and its receptor, Flk1, in NSCs. The numbers of Flk1 knock-out mice embryo-derived and ES cell-derived primitive NSCs were increased because of the enhanced survival of primitive NSCs. In contrast, neural precursor-specific, Flk1 conditional knock-out mice-derived, definitive NSCs numbers were decreased because of the enhanced cell death of definitive NSCs. These effects were not observed in cells lacking Flt1, another VEGF receptor. In addition, the cell death stimulated by VEGF-A of primitive NSC and the cell survival stimulated by VEGF-A of definitive NSC were blocked by Flk1/Fc-soluble receptors and VEGF-A function-blocking antibodies. These VEGF-A phenotypes also were blocked by inhibition of the downstream effector nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Thus, both the cell death of primitive NSC and the cell survival of definitive NSC induced by VEGF-A stimulation are mediated by bifunctional NF-kappaB effects. In conclusion, VEGF-A function through Flk1 mediates survival (and not proliferative or fate change) effects on NSCs, specifically.","['Wada, Tamaki', 'Haigh, Jody J', 'Ema, Masatsugu', 'Hitoshi, Seiji', 'Chaddah, Radha', 'Rossant, Janet', 'Nagy, Andras', 'van der Kooy, Derek']","['Wada T', 'Haigh JJ', 'Ema M', 'Hitoshi S', 'Chaddah R', 'Rossant J', 'Nagy A', 'van der Kooy D']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Microbiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3E1. tamaki.wada@utoronto.ca']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SU 1498)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EQ43SC3GDB (Brachyury protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cinnamates/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fetal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neural Inhibition/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/classification/*drug effects/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/classification/*drug effects/physiology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/deficiency']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/25/6803 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0526-06.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2006 Jun 21;26(25):6803-12. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0526-06.2006.,,,,,PMC6673824,,,,,,,,,

As for PKCs, the particles were observed to express the mRNAs of PKC-alpha,-beta I, -beta-II, -delta, epsilon, eta and theta, but not-gamma and zeta. Using immunoblot analysis, PKC-beta I, -beta II and zeta were shown to exist in the particles, although the contents were lower than those in platelets. Furthermore, the presence of Gi2-alpha, a heterotrimeric G protein that is the major pertussis toxin substrate in human platelets, and beta subunits was observed in the particles. Taken together, the particles possess some similarity to human platelets based on the expression profiles of GTP-binding proteins and PKCs.","['Nagata, K', 'Okano, Y', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nagata K', 'Okano Y', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Molecular Pathobiochemistry, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan. kinagata@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,,,,2006/06/24 09:00,2006/06/24 09:01,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:01 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['DKT1RB39YVR8TP8H [pii]', '10.1080/09537109876528 [doi]']",ppublish,Platelets. 1998;9(5):291-6. doi: 10.1080/09537109876528.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We injected autologous DC into patients in late chronic or accelerated phases of CML. The patients received mature CD83+ and bcr-abl+ DC prepared from CD14+ cells. Two cohorts of three patients received four injections each of 3 x 10(6) DC and 15 x 10(6) DC/injection, respectively. The first patient was studied before imatinib mesylate (IM) was available, four patients were treated concurrently with IM therapy and one did not tolerate the IM and was off the drug at the time of DC therapy. IM effects on WBC counts precluded DC preparation in numbers sufficient for further dose escalation. The first patient received DC s.c. and all subsequent patients received DC into a cervical lymph node under ultrasound guidance. RESULTS: DC injections were well tolerated. We observed no clinical responses. T cells drawn later in the course of therapy were more sensitive to stimulation by CML DC in vitro. DISCUSSION: The increase in T-cell sensitivity to CML-specific stimulation that accompanied active immunization by CML DC justifies further clinical studies, possibly with modifications such as an increased frequency and number of DC injections.","['Litzow, M R', 'Dietz, A B', 'Bulur, P A', 'Butler, G W', 'Gastineau, D A', 'Hoering, A', 'Fink, S R', 'Letendre, L', 'Padley, D J', 'Paternoster, S F', 'Tefferi, A', 'Vuk-Pavlovic, S']","['Litzow MR', 'Dietz AB', 'Bulur PA', 'Butler GW', 'Gastineau DA', 'Hoering A', 'Fink SR', 'Letendre L', 'Padley DJ', 'Paternoster SF', 'Tefferi A', 'Vuk-Pavlovic S']","['Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA 15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 84368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Immunotherapy, Active/adverse effects/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['U376L0587336W585 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240600735743 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2006;8(3):290-8. doi: 10.1080/14653240600735743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro co-culture of platelets and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts with allogeneic platelets enhances blast proliferation and constitutive cytokine secretion. In the present study the effects of AML blasts on the platelet release of soluble mediators are characterized. Normal platelets released soluble (s) P-selectin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), both when cultured alone and in the presence of AML blasts, and for certain patients the presence of AML blasts increased the platelet release of these mediators. Addition of exogenous interleukin (IL) 10 to platelet-AML blast cultures further increased platelet release of PDGF and sP-selectin. For certain patients decreased AML blast cytokine secretion was observed when PDGF-specific antibodies were added to cultures with blasts plus platelets, these results indicate that platelet release of PDGF is a molecular mechanism for the enhancement of AML blast cytokine secretion.

Addition of platelets also increased constitutive blast secretion of Interleukin 1beta (IL1beta ), IL6, GM-CSF and TNFalpha, whereas platelets had no effect on the release of IL1 receptor antagonist. The effects of platelets on constitutive cytokine secretion were also detected when platelets and AML blasts were cultured in different chambers separated by a permeable membrane, and a further enhancement was achieved when blasts and platelets were cultured together.

However, none was able to show a survival advantage. Thus, a systematic Cochrane review may be able to further define the role of purine analogues in the first-line treatment of B-CLL. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing single-agent purine analogues with alkylator-based regimens were included. Medical databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE), conference proceedings and trial registers were searched. We included full-text and abstract publications as well as unpublished data. Relative risks (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated under a fixed-effects model, clinical and statistical heterogeneity was examined with sensitivity analyses and meta-regression. If applicable, numbers needed to treat or harm (NNT, NNH) were also determined. FINDINGS: Five trials with 1838 randomized patients were included. Importantly, four trials had a cross-over design. There was a trend for improved overall survival for patients receiving purine analogues as initial therapy but statistical significance was just not reached (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.78-1.01]). The RR for achieving an overall (RR 1.22 [95% CI 1.13-1.31]; NNT 8 [95% CI 6-13]) and complete response (RR 1.94 [95% CI 1.65-2.28]; NNT 6 [5-8]) was significantly improved, resulting in a longer progression-free survival (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.61-0.82]). Incidence of grade III/IV infections (RR 1.83 [95% CI 1.30-2.58]; NNH 20 [95% CI 12.5-50]) and haemolytic anaemia (RR 3.36 [95% CI 1.27-8.91]; NNH 21 [95% CI 6-185]) was significantly higher in patients receiving purine analogues. INTERPRETATION: Despite significantly increased response rates and longer progression-free survival with purine analogues as first-line therapy, we were not able to detect a statistically significant improvement of overall survival compared to alkylator-based regimens. Furthermore, the use of purine analogues augments the risk for grade III/IV infections and haemolytic anaemia.","['Steurer, Michael', 'Pall, Georg', 'Richards, Sue', 'Schwarzer, Guido', 'Bohlius, Julia', 'Greil, Richard']","['Steurer M', 'Pall G', 'Richards S', 'Schwarzer G', 'Bohlius J', 'Greil R']","['Innsbruck Medical University, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Anichstrasse 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. michael.steurer@uibk.ac.at']",['Cochrane Haematologic Malignancies Group'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0305-7372(06)00099-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2006 Aug;32(5):377-89. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.05.002.

Structurally, Fes consists of a unique N-terminal region, followed by SH2 (Src homology domain 2) and kinase domains. Two coiled-coil (CC) domains (CC1 and CC2) located within the unique N-terminal region are critical regulators of Fes activity in vivo and may function to recruit Fes activators and/or substrates. A yeast two-hybrid screen, utilizing a K-562 cell cDNA library and the Fes CC2 domain as bait, identified an interacting clone encoding the CC domain and B-box motifs (residues 114-357) of the transcriptional co-repressor KRAB-associated protein (KAP)-1. KAP-1(114-357) interacted with full-length Fes in yeast, and the KAP-1 CC domain was sufficient to bind the Fes N-terminal region in Sf-9 cells. Co-expression of Fes with full-length KAP-1 in human 293T cells stimulated Fes autophosphorylation and led to KAP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Association of endogenous Fes and KAP-1 was also observed in HL-60 myeloid leukaemia cells. Together, these data identify a novel Fes-KAP-1 interaction, and suggest a dual role for KAP-1 as both a Fes activator and downstream effector.","['Delfino, Frank J', 'Shaffer, Jonathan M', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Delfino FJ', 'Shaffer JM', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA058667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM28 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Insecta', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28']",2006/06/24 09:00,2006/10/14 09:00,['2006/06/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20060194 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20060194 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2006 Oct 1;399(1):141-50. doi: 10.1042/BJ20060194.,,,,,PMC1570157,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURES: We used in vivo phage display to interrogate early atherosclerotic lesions present in ApoE-/- mice with the goal of identifying plaque-associated endothelial cell internalized affinity ligands. RESULTS: We identified 30 phage families with some of these families exhibiting homology to known atherosclerotic proteins, namely, leukemia inhibitory factor, transferrin, and VLA-4. VLA-4 homologous peptides [termed vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) internalizing peptide-28 (VINP28)] bound to and were internalized by VCAM-1-expressing cells and were inhibited by soluble VCAM-1. In addition, a VINP28 modified multimodal nanoparticle showed high affinity for endothelial cells expressing VCAM-1 but low affinity for macrophages or smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSION: The identified peptides represent a set of probes to interrogate the cell surface repertoire and potentially allow early detection of atherosclerosis.","['Kelly, Kimberly A', 'Nahrendorf, Matthias', 'Yu, Amy M', 'Reynolds, Fred', 'Weissleder, Ralph']","['Kelly KA', 'Nahrendorf M', 'Yu AM', 'Reynolds F', 'Weissleder R']","['Center for Molecular Imaging Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 149, 13th Street, Rm 5404, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Imaging Biol,Molecular imaging and biology,101125610,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['*Affinity Labels', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/deficiency', 'Atherosclerosis/*diagnosis', 'Carotid Stenosis/*diagnosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Magnetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'Nanostructures', '*Peptide Library', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11307-006-0043-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Imaging Biol. 2006 Jul-Aug;8(4):201-7. doi: 10.1007/s11307-006-0043-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, most of these cases had AML with AML1/ETO rearrangement. The malignant cells were differentiated and considered mature cells after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. To clarify the possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we investigated the expression levels of G-CSFR in AML cells with AML1/ETO rearrangement by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The number of AML1/ETO+ cells expressing G-CSFR at baseline was significantly higher than that of AML1/ETO- AML cells (2673 vs 522). In addition, the G-CSFR gene was more highly expressed in AML1/ETO+ cells than in AML1/ETO- cells by real-time PCR. This study reveals that cases showing remission after treatment with G-CSF mostly had leukemia with AML1/ETO rearrangement. This finding might be explained by the higher expression of G-CSF receptor in AML1/ETO+ cells than in AML1/ETO- cells.

Antiapoptotic isoforms of p73 that lack part of the transactivation (TA) domain (DeltaTA-p73, i.e. p73Deltaex2, p73Deltaex3, p73Deltaex2/3 and DeltaN-p73) may cause resistance to anticancer agents through inhibition of p53 and/or proapoptotic p73 family members (TA-p73). We demonstrate in our study that the expression of total p73 mRNA was higher in childhood T-ALL compared to controls (P=0.004). In T-ALL, the relative contribution of antiapoptotic DeltaTA-p73 (88%) was larger than of proapoptotic TA-p73 (12%). Leukaemic cells of T-ALL patients expressing higher levels of antiapoptotic p73 were more resistant to the DNA-damaging drug daunorubicin compared to cells of patients with low or negative expression or these isoforms (P(trend)=0.045). Interestingly, p73Deltaex2 was the most abundantly expressed antiapoptotic isoform in daunorubicin-resistant patient cells (44% of total p73). No association was found between high expression of proapoptotic TA-p73 or antiapoptotic DeltaTA-p73 and relapse-risk. Our results suggest that childhood T-ALL is associated with a high expression of DeltaTA-p73. These isoforms may play a role in cellular resistance to DNA-damaging drugs in children at initial diagnosis of T-ALL.","['Meier, M', 'den Boer, M L', 'Meijerink, J P P', 'Broekhuis, M J C', 'Passier, M M C J', 'van Wering, E R', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Pieters, R']","['Meier M', 'den Boer ML', 'Meijerink JP', 'Broekhuis MJ', 'Passier MM', 'van Wering ER', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404288 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404288 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1377-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404288.

Allele frequencies in the controls showed a very low frequency of the variant allele in blacks, 0.7% compared to 4% in white controls. In light of this, analysis was restricted to a comparison of white cases and controls only. Overall genotype frequencies were similar in white ALL cases and normal white controls (P=0.58), indicating that in contrast to the previous report, A91V polymorphism is not associated with increased risk of childhood ALL.

In erythrocytes PGE2 induced suicidal cell death involves activation of nonselective cation channels leading to Ca2+ entry followed by cell shrinkage and triggering of Ca2+ sensitive cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure at the cell surface. The present study was performed to explore whether PGE2 induces apoptosis of nucleated cells similarly through cation channel activation and to possibly disclose the molecular identity of the cation channels involved. To this end, Ca2+ activity was estimated from Fluo3 fluorescence, mitochondrial potential from DePsipher fluorescence, phosphatidylserine exposure from annexin binding, caspase activation from caspAce fluorescence, cell volume from FACS forward scatter, and DNA fragmentation utilizing a photometric enzyme immunoassay. Stimulation of K562 human leukaemia cells with PGE2 (50 microM) increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity, decreased forward scatter, depolarized the mitochondrial potential, increased annexin binding, led to caspase activation and resulted in DNA fragmentation. Gene silencing of the Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential cation channel TRPC7 significantly blunted PGE2-induced triggering of PS exposure and DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, K562 cells express Ca2+-permeable TRPC7 channels, which are activated by PGE2 and participate in the triggering of apoptosis.","['Foller, Michael', 'Kasinathan, Ravi S', 'Duranton, Christophe', 'Wieder, Thomas', 'Huber, Stephan M', 'Lang, Florian']","['Foller M', 'Kasinathan RS', 'Duranton C', 'Wieder T', 'Huber SM', 'Lang F']","['Department of Physiology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Acid Sensing Ion Channels)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPC7 protein, human)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VW50CE070T (ethylisopropylamiloride)']",IM,"['Acid Sensing Ion Channels', 'Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/drug effects/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dinoprostone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Sodium Channels/drug effects/genetics', 'TRPC Cation Channels/drug effects/genetics']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['94125 [pii]', '10.1159/000094125 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2006;17(5-6):201-10. doi: 10.1159/000094125.

Infection of mice with self-destructing L. monocytogenes carriers delivering mRNA that encodes a nonsecreted form of ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in a significant OVA-specific CD8 T-cell response. In contrast, infection with L. monocytogenes delivering OVA-encoding DNA failed to generate specific T cells. Secretion of OVA by the carrier bacteria yielded the strongest immune response involving OVA-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. In addition, we investigated the antigen delivery capacity of a self-destructing, virulence-attenuated L. monocytogenes aroA/B mutant. In contrast to the wild-type strain, this mutant exhibited only marginal liver toxicity when high doses (5 x 10(7) CFU per animal administered intravenously) were used, and it was also able to deliver sufficient amounts of secreted OVA into mice. Therefore, the results presented here could lay the groundwork for a rational combination of L. monocytogenes as an attenuated carrier for the delivery of protein and nucleic acid vaccines in novel vaccination strategies.","['Loeffler, Daniela I M', 'Schoen, Christoph U', 'Goebel, Werner', 'Pilgrim, Sabine']","['Loeffler DI', 'Schoen CU', 'Goebel W', 'Pilgrim S']","['Dade Behring Marburg GmbH, P.O.

METHODS: An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on a validated tissue microarray containing 271 B cell lymphoma specimens, 197 of which included follow-up data. Statistical assessment was done by Pearson's chi(2) test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance and survival analysis. RESULTS: 266 (98%) cases were evaluable. Strong VEGF expression was observed in only 20 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Flk-1 and COX2 were expressed in 53 and 21 cases, respectively, mainly in DLBCLs, follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3 and mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), in a low proportion of cells. MVD decreased in the following order: DLBCLs, FLs, MCLs and small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL/CLLs). VEGF expression correlated with Ki-67, p53 and COX2 expression in the whole cohort and in DLBCLs. Flk-1 expression correlated with Ki-67 in the cohort and in SLL/CLL and FL grade 1 and 2. COX2 expression correlated with Ki-67 and p53. The analysed angiogenesis parameters did not correlate with clinical parameters or survival. CONCLUSIONS: Angiogenesis plays a differential role in various B cell lymphomas. Aggressive lymphomas express the potential molecular therapeutic targets VEGF and COX2, and have higher MVD. In a few low proliferation-fraction lymphomas, Flk-1 might have a role in proliferative advantage. Therapeutic strategies aimed at angiogenesis should take into account lymphoma heterogeneity.","['Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Heiss, Simone', 'Ebner, Stephanie', 'Sterlacci, William', 'Schaefer, Georg', 'Augustin, Florian', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan']","['Tzankov A', 'Heiss S', 'Ebner S', 'Sterlacci W', 'Schaefer G', 'Augustin F', 'Fiegl M', 'Dirnhofer S']","['Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. atzankov@uhbs.ch']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2006/06/23 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2006.038661 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2006.038661 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2007 May;60(5):476-82. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2006.038661.

In this study, the effects of different OS on the expression of endometrial integrin beta3 subunit and leukaemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) during the implantation window and the implantation rate in mice were investigated. METHODS: Three OS protocols were used, involving either pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) alone, PMSG plus GnRH agonist or PMSG plus GnRH antagonist. Uterus samples were collected at 48 h after OS or ovulation and were detected with immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses. Normal embryos at gestation day 4 were transferred into the uteri of mice in the control and OS groups. RESULTS: All OS groups showed a significant decrease in the expression of both the endometrial integrin beta3 subunit and LIF during the implantation window and the implantation rate. Among the three OS groups, GnRH agonist-treated mice showed a higher endometrial integrin beta3 subunit and LIF expression and a higher implantation rate. No significant difference was found in the measured indices between the GnRH antagonist and PMSG groups. CONCLUSIONS: OS may inhibit the expression of endometrial integrin beta3 subunit and LIF and impair endometrial receptivity in mice. OS with GnRH agonist, but not GnRH antagonist, may partially restore the endometrial physiological secretion and improve uterine receptivity.","['Ruan, Heng-Chao', 'Zhu, Xiao-Ming', 'Luo, Qiong', 'Liu, Ai-Xia', 'Qian, Yu-Li', 'Zhou, Cai-Yun', 'Jin, Fan', 'Huang, He-Feng', 'Sheng, Jian-Zhong']","['Ruan HC', 'Zhu XM', 'Luo Q', 'Liu AX', 'Qian YL', 'Zhou CY', 'Jin F', 'Huang HF', 'Sheng JZ']","[""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Gonadotropins, Equine)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '08AN7WA2G0 (Triptorelin Pamoate)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/drug effects/physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*agonists/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gonadotropins, Equine/*pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3/drug effects/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Morula/drug effects/physiology', 'Ovulation Induction/*methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Triptorelin Pamoate/*pharmacology', 'Uterus/cytology/drug effects/*physiology']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['del215 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/del215 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2006 Oct;21(10):2521-9. doi: 10.1093/humrep/del215.

Extramedullary involvement is a rare manifestation of acute and chronic leukemias and of multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, with the expanding use of targeted treatments there is an impression that the incidence of extramedullary relapses is increasing. We reviewed the reports on this phenomenon in patients treated with all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia, thalidomide and bortezomib for multiple myeloma and imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia. The pathogenetic mechanisms suggested are: life prolongation by these treatments allowing for disease progression arising from dormant cells; poor penetration of the drugs to sanctuary sites like the central nervous system; the requirement of some of these drugs, especially thalidomide, for the marrow microenvironment to exert their action; and finally, a possible active role for some of the drugs, like all-trans-retinoic acid. Since the use of these targeted therapies is expanding we should be aware of this association.","['Raanani, P', 'Shpilberg, O', 'Ben-Bassat, I']","['Raanani P', 'Shpilberg O', 'Ben-Bassat I']","['Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tikva.

In this review we define proteomics of the oncogene product p53 as the study of proteins in the p53 regulating signaling networks, as well as the protein study of members of the p53 family itself. Various messenger RNA splice forms as well as a multitude of post-translational modifications give a high number of protein isoforms in the p53 family. Some of the proteomic techniques allow detection of various isoforms, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and this methodology may therefore increasingly be used as a diagnostic tool in human disease. We introduce the p53 protein as an illustration of the complexity of post-translational modifications that may affect one highly connected protein and discuss the possible impact in AML diagnostics if the p53 profile is reflecting cell stress and status of signal transduction systems of the malignancy.","['Anensen, Nina', 'Haaland, Ingvild', ""D'Santos, Clive"", 'Van Belle, Werner', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Anensen N', 'Haaland I', ""D'Santos C"", 'Van Belle W', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitins)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/09/08 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920106777549731 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Jun;7(3):199-207. doi: 10.2174/138920106777549731.,107,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomere length decreases with each cell division, thus, reflecting the mitotic history of somatic cells. Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme which maintains telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes, is up-regulated in the vast majority of human neoplasia but not in normal somatic tissues. In contrast to other somatic cells, normal primitive human hematopoietic cells and some peripheral blood cells expressed low levels of telomerase activity. This activity is thought to play an important role in self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. In malignant disorders, telomere lengths are generally shortened and telomerase expression and activity enhanced with high differences in the levels. Although it is necessary to be cautious in interpreting these data, there are indications that telomere length and telomerase expression and activity can serve as a molecular marker of the clinical progression and prognosis of most leukemias. Approaches that directly target telomerase, telomeres or telomerase regulatory mechanisms have been developed. Some of these anti-telomerase strategies in combination with conventional drugs proved to be promising in some types of leukemias.","['Deville, Laure', 'Hillion, Josette', 'Lanotte, Michel', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne']","['Deville L', 'Hillion J', 'Lanotte M', 'Rousselot P', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['INSERM U685, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/enzymology/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/09/08 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920106777549768 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Jun;7(3):171-83. doi: 10.2174/138920106777549768.,158,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With current treatment modalities the five years overall survival hardly exceeds 50%. Cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics guide the clinician to select individualized therapy in certain subsets of AML, achieving long-term survival above 70% of these cases. However, approximately half of the AML patients have no risk stratifying features, and early reports indicate that proteomic approaches may be utilized for disease classification as well as development of novel biomarkers related to prognosis, diagnosis, and choice of therapeutic regimen. Proteomics, here defined as the analysis of all proteins in a cell, in a cell compartment or in a signaling pathway, has probably its greatest potential in investigating pathways that are easily targeted by small molecules or therapeutic antibodies. The major methodological challenges include detection sensitivity in a limited clinical material, a problem that in some cases can be solved through designated multiplexed protein assays based on single cells or cell extracts. In this review we will discuss pharmacoproteomic studies of drugs regulating leukemia specific targets like all-trans retinoic acid, histone deacetylase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as studies on drug resistance and graft-versus-host studies during stem cell transplantations.

This sequence specificity is similar to adozelesin and CC-1065. Using a 4-day continuous exposure, compound 1 inhibited the growth of K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells in culture. Compound 1 has appreciable cytotoxicity (IC50 value of 1.30 microM) relative to compound 2 (0.15 microM), the corresponding racemic and hydroxy-seco-CI-TMI analog. These results indicate that the aminophenethyl chloride group present in compound 1 has similar sequence specific and cytotoxic properties to the hydroxy-containing seco-precursors of CC-1065 and the duocarmycins.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrates preferentially within active transcription units, whereas murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrates preferentially near transcription start sites and CpG islands. We investigated the viral determinants of integration-site selection using HIV chimeras with MLV genes substituted for their HIV counterparts. We found that transferring the MLV integrase (IN) coding region into HIV (to make HIVmIN) caused the hybrid to integrate with a specificity close to that of MLV. Addition of MLV gag (to make HIVmGagmIN) further increased the similarity of target-site selection to that of MLV. A chimeric virus with MLV Gag only (HIVmGag) displayed targeting preferences different from that of both HIV and MLV, further implicating Gag proteins in targeting as well as IN. We also report a genome-wide analysis indicating that MLV, but not HIV, favors integration near DNase I-hypersensitive sites (i.e., +/- 1 kb), and that HIVmIN and HIVmGagmIN also favored integration near these features. These findings reveal that IN is the principal viral determinant of integration specificity; they also reveal a new role for Gag-derived proteins, and strengthen models for integration targeting based on tethering of viral IN proteins to host proteins.","['Lewinski, Mary K', 'Yamashita, Masahiro', 'Emerman, Michael', 'Ciuffi, Angela', 'Marshall, Heather', 'Crawford, Gregory', 'Collins, Francis', 'Shinn, Paul', 'Leipzig, Jeremy', 'Hannenhalli, Sridhar', 'Berry, Charles C', 'Ecker, Joseph R', 'Bushman, Frederic D']","['Lewinski MK', 'Yamashita M', 'Emerman M', 'Ciuffi A', 'Marshall H', 'Crawford G', 'Collins F', 'Shinn P', 'Leipzig J', 'Hannenhalli S', 'Berry CC', 'Ecker JR', 'Bushman FD']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, The Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.']",,['eng'],"['AI30927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI034786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI52845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI030927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI030927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI030927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Attachment Sites, Microbiological/genetics/physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA, Viral', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/chemistry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Glycosaminoglycans/genetics/physiology', 'HIV/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Puromycin/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']",2006/06/23 09:00,2006/08/03 09:00,['2006/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['06-PLPA-RA-0089R1 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.ppat.0020060 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2006 Jun;2(6):e60. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0020060.

Reciprocal Alteration of Innate Resistance or Susceptibility by Bone Marrow Transplantation Between Congenic Strains.,837-43,"Two newly established mouse strains which are congenic with standard inbred strains were used for the study of the locus Fv which controls the susceptibility to Friend leukemia virus in mice. A strain in each congenic pair shares the major histocompatibility gene with the corresponding partner strain but differs from the latter in the Fv locus. Mice with Fv(r)/Fv(r) genotype (DDD-Fv(r), C57BL/6) do not develop marked spleen enlargement upon virus challenge, whereas spleens of mice with Fv(s)/Fv(s) genotype (DDD, C57BL/6-Fv(s)) become large even with a virus inoculum 1/10(3) to 1/10(5) times that used for the resistant strains. Mice of each strain were heavily irradiated, inoculated with bone marrow cells taken from either syngenic or corresponding congenic mice, and challenged later with the leukemia virus. When Fv(s)/Fv(s) mice had been restored with bone marrow cells taken from Fv(r)/Fv(r) mice, the spleens remained small after the virus inoculation. In contrast, Fv(r)/Fv(r) mice receiving Fv(s)/Fv(s) cells responded to the virus with marked spleen enlargement. In the enlarged spleens of the C57BL/6 mice which do not otherwise allow the virus multiplication, a considerable amount of infectious virus was found. The altered response seems to be due to repopulation of destroyed tissues by the transplanted bone marrow cells. It is concluded that the locus Fv is expressed on hemopoietic cells, and cells derived from bone marrow play a predominant role in the development of splenomegaly by Friend leukemia virus.","['Odaka, T', 'Matsukura, M']","['Odaka T', 'Matsukura M']","['Institute of Medical Science, Takanawa, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,,,1969/12/01 00:00,1969/12/01 00:01,['1969/12/01 00:00'],"['1969/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1969/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1969/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.4.6.837-843.1969 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1969 Dec;4(6):837-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.4.6.837-843.1969.,,,,,PMC375946,,,,,,,,,

She had high HBV-DNA levels, and became positive for HBeAg, in the absence of detectable HBsAg. HBV-DNA was extracted from serum and the HBsAg encoding region of the genome was amplified by PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing. The HBV strain appeared to be subtype adw, but had higher nucleotide homology with ayw than adw isolates, supported further by phylogenetic tree analysis. Amino-acid sequence comparisons over the alpha determinant region revealed the following substitutions: C124N, G130R, and N146S. There were also unique substitutions outside the alpha determinant. All these mutations appeared to have a profound effect on the antigenicity of this region, which resulted in failure to detect HBsAg by commercially available diagnostic assays.

Manipulation of IL-15 signaling through gene aberration, overexpression, or receptor alterations has been shown to dramatically affect T-cell homeostasis, with overexpression leading to fatal leukemia. Here we show that TGF-beta is the critical negative regulator of murine CD8+ memory T-cell homeostasis with direct opposition to the positive effects of IL-15. This negative regulation is mediated, at least in part, by the ability of TGF-beta to modulate expression of the beta-chain of the IL-15 receptor, thus establishing a central axis between these 2 cytokines for homeostatic control of CD8+ memory T-cell populations.

Its expression profiles have suggested that it plays a role in the differentiation of blood cells during early human embryonic development and the pathogenesis of leukemia. To gain additional insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the ZNF268 gene and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of leukemia, we have mapped the 5'-end of the human ZNF268 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and primer extension assays. We then cloned the 5'-flanking genomic DNA containing the putative ZNF268 gene promoter and analyzed its function in several different human and mouse tissue culture cell lines. Interestingly, our studies show that the ZNF268 gene lacks a typical eukaryotic promoter that is present upstream of the transcription start site and directs a basal level of transcription. Instead, the functional promoter requires an essential element that is located within the first exon of the gene. Deletion and mutational analysis reveals the requirement for a cAMP response-element-binding protein (CREB)-binding site within this element for promoter function. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirm that CREB-2 binds to the site in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of CREB-2 enhances the promoter activity. These results demonstrate that the human ZNF268 gene promoter is atypical and requires an intragenic element located within the first exon that mediates the effect of CREB for its activity.","['Guo, Ming-Xiong', 'Wang, Di', 'Shao, Huan-Jie', 'Qiu, Hong-Ling', 'Xue, Lu', 'Zhao, Zhou-Zhou', 'Zhu, Chen-Gang', 'Shi, Yun-Bo', 'Li, Wen-Xin']","['Guo MX', 'Wang D', 'Shao HJ', 'Qiu HL', 'Xue L', 'Zhao ZZ', 'Zhu CG', 'Shi YB', 'Li WX']","['State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZNF268 protein, human)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",2006/06/22 09:00,2006/11/07 09:00,['2006/06/22 09:00'],"['2006/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(18)95152-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M602753200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Aug 25;281(34):24623-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M602753200.

The patients are treated with immunosuppressive therapies; however, in some cases treatment is not effective. We used enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), for the control of proteinuria in a case of immunosuppressive treatment (IST)-resistant nephrotic syndrome. A 15-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic peripheral blood SCT from a completely HLA-matched sibling after completion of a conditioning regimen composed of 12-Gy doses of total-body irradiation, 600 mg/m2 thiotepa, and 140 mg/m2 melphalan. Twenty-eight months after SCT, minimal-change nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of biopsy findings. Although neither cyclosporine (trough level, 100-150 ng/mL) nor corticosteroid was effective, proteinuria disappeared 2 months after the beginning of treatment with tacrolimus (trough level, 13-20 ng/mL), and remission was maintained for 23 months. Nephrotic syndrome recurred, however, and was resistant to tacrolimus. Findings at the second renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy. An ARB (candesartan, 4 mg/ day) in combination with an ACEI (enalapril, 5 mg/day) was started. Proteinuria improved within 2 weeks. We suggest that ARB combined with ACEI can be used to control proteinuria in patients with IST-resistant nephrotic syndrome after SCT.","['Osugi, Yuko', 'Yamada, Hiroshi', 'Hosoi, Gaku', 'Noma, Haruyoshi', 'Ikemiya, Misako', 'Ishii, Takefumi', 'Sako, Masahiro']","['Osugi Y', 'Yamada H', 'Hosoi G', 'Noma H', 'Ikemiya M', 'Ishii T', 'Sako M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.

Survivin, a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein family, correlates with inhibition of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and multiple drugs resistance. This study aimed to investigate the variation of the survivin gene expression in apoptosis induced by dexamethasone (Dex) in the human T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, CEM-WT cells. METHODS: The logarithmically growing CEM cells cultured in vitro (cell density 2 x10(5)/mL) were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 microM Dex, then were collected 24, 48 and 72 hrs later. Untreated CEM cells were used as Controls. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis was evaluated by morphology and flow cytometry. Survivin protein and gene were analyzed by Western Blot and RT-PCR. RESULTS: CEM cells growth was obviously inhibited by 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 microM Dex from 48 hrs. The inhibition effect was dose- and time-dependent. CEM cells treated with Dex (> or = 5 microM) exhibited typical apoptotic features. The apoptosis increased after 5 microM Dex treatment in a time-dependent manner, with the apoptosis percentage increasing from 14.9% (12 hrs) to 46.2% (48 hrs). Compared with that of the Control group, the expression of survivin protein was down-regulated, with the expression rate of 54.6%, 45.5%, 15.8% and 9.7% respectively at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs after 5 microM Dex treatment. 5 microM Dex treatment also resulted in a decrease of survivin mRNA expression. The survivin mRNA expression was 76.4%, 67.3%, 55.0%, 49.9%, 38.3% and 18.3% of the Control respectively at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs after Dex treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis induced by Dex in CEM cells is associated with downregulation of the survivin expression.","['He, Li', 'Liu, Yun-Peng', 'Hou, Ke-Zuo', 'Li, Dan', 'Zhu, Zhi-Tu', 'Zhang, Jing-Dong']","['He L', 'Liu YP', 'Hou KZ', 'Li D', 'Zhu ZT', 'Zhang JD']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China. hlcmu@yahoo.com.cn']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Survivin']",2006/06/22 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/06/22 09:00'],"['2006/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2006)03-0173-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2006 Jun;8(3):173-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By simultaneously affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell, such as deregulation of the programmed degradation of many cellular proteins, proteasome inhibition causes rapid apoptosis of these cells. Both in rapidly proliferating leukaemic cell lines and in primary leukaemic cells isolated from patients, proteasome inhibition results in antileukaemic activity. The normal counterparts of these cells are much more resistant to proteasome inhibitors (PI), thereby resulting in a favourable therapeutic index. Importantly, while leukaemic stem cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibition, normal haematopoietic stem cells are still viable after drug exposure. Nowadays, many PIs are being identified; bortezomib is the most well known since obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use in MM.

Other studies have examined the ability of amplicons to elicit immune responses against encoded antigens, and have shown that strong cellular immune responses can be generated against amplicon encoded HIV-1 antigens in mice. Thus, amplicon vectors have shown significant promise as vaccine vectors in a range of settings. These promising initial findings highlight the need to perform additional studies, including experiments to evaluate the immunogenicity of amplicon vectors in additional animal models, possibly including nonhuman primates. Overall, amplicon vectors offer compelling advantages when compared to other vaccine-delivery platforms, which include the capacity to incorporate a very large transgene payload and the potential to efficiently transduce mucosal surfaces. It will be important to design future studies to directly test and exploit these features of the amplicon system. The next few years therefore promise to be an exciting and important period in the development of amplicons as vaccine vectors.","['Santos, Kathlyn', 'Duke, Cindy M P', 'Dewhurst, Stephen']","['Santos K', 'Duke CM', 'Dewhurst S']","['University of Rochester, Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",,['eng'],"['F31 AI054330/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI056356/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007356/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/therapeutic use', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Vaccines/*genetics/therapeutic use']",2006/06/22 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2006/06/22 09:00'],"['2006/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156652306777592009 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2006 Jun;6(3):383-92. doi: 10.2174/156652306777592009.,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of this high telomerase activity, ATL cells retained shorter telomeres compared to those of uninfected cells isolated from the same patients. Because the safeguarding of telomere length is critical to the unlimited proliferation of tumor cells, we investigated the underlying mechanism for short telomere maintenance in ATL cells. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional expression of telomere-binding proteins TRF1, TRF2, TIN2 and POT1, known to regulate telomere homeostasis and protection, were evaluated. We found that TRF1 and TRF2 are overexpressed in in vivo patient's samples from ATL but not asymptomatic carriers, while levels of POT1 expression did not specifically increase in ATL. To gain insights into the regulation of TRF genes in HTLV-I infected cells, we investigated the expression of TIN2, a regulator of these genes, and found an increase in TIN2 expression in ATL patients. Together our results underscore the importance of telomerase and telomere length regulating factors as novel markers for ATL disease progression and as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HTLV-I-associated malignancies.","['Bellon, Marcia', 'Datta, Abhik', 'Brown, Megan', 'Pouliquen, Jean-Francois', 'Couppie, Pierre', 'Kazanji, Mirdad', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Datta A', 'Brown M', 'Pouliquen JF', 'Couppie P', 'Kazanji M', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (TINF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/*genetics', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/*genetics']",2006/06/21 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/06/21 09:00'],"['2006/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22026 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Nov 1;119(9):2090-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the possible mechanisms by which dideoxypetrosynol A exerts its anti-proliferative action in cultured human monocytic leukemia U937 cells. We observed that the proliferation-inhibitory effect of dideoxypetrosynol A was due to the induction of G1 arrest in the cell cycle, the effects of which were associated with up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of cyclin E, in a concentration-dependent manner without any change in cyclin-dependent-kinases (Cdks) expression. Dideoxypetrosynol A markedly induced the levels of Cdk inhibitor p16/INK4a expression. Furthermore, down-regulation of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by this compound was associated with enhanced binding of pRB and transcription factor E2F-1.

The authors investigated the expression of CD34, VEGF, bFGF, and TGF-beta and their receptors in different stages of B-CLL by analyzing bone marrow samples from 23 patients (11 with Rai stages 0-II; 12 with stages III or IV). TGF-beta2 was expressed more strongly in stages 0 to II than in stages III or IV (P=0.03). There was no significant difference in the intensity of CD34, TGF-beta1, VEGF, and bFGF and their receptors between stages 0 to II and stages III or IV.

The major limitation of TaqMan PCR assays is that they do not detect the size of the amplified target sequence. TaqMan PCR coupled with capillary electrophoresis is an alternative approach that can be used to circumvent this limitation. In this chapter, the utility of this approach in the identification and quantification of bcr-abl fusion transcripts produced as a result of t(9;22)(q34;q11) in chronic myelogenous leukemia is described. In this assay, abl primer labeled at its 5'-end with the fluorescent dye NED (Applied Biosystems [ABI], Foster City, CA) is incorporated into the bcr-abl fusion product during the real-time PCR. The incorporated NED fluorescent dye is then used subsequently to identify the specific fusion transcript present in a given specimen by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan (ABI) analysis. Knowledge of the type of fusion transcript present in a specimen is useful to rule out false-positive results and to compare clones before and after therapy.","['Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Taq Polymerase']",2006/06/21 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/06/21 09:00'],"['2006/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1-59745-069-3:135 [pii]', '10.1385/1-59745-069-3:135 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2006;335:135-45. doi: 10.1385/1-59745-069-3:135.,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study documents that tumors growing within an immune-privileged site within the eye develop a tumor escape phenotype in the absence of selective T cell pressure. P815 tumor cells that are recovered from progressively growing tumors within the anterior chamber of the eye escape elimination when injected into the flanks of a second group of syngeneic DBA/2 mice that were previously immunized against P815 tumor cells. The escape phenotype of eye-derived P815 tumors was stable and permanent when the tumor cells were cultured in vitro. Eye-derived tumor cells recovered from the anterior chamber of CB-17 SCID mice also escaped elimination when injected into the flanks of immunized mice, demonstrating that selective pressure by tumor Ag-specific T cells did not contribute to the development of the escape phenotype. In vitro studies demonstrated that eye-derived tumor cells were not lysed by specific CTL and were unable to restimulate primed Ag-specific T cells. Immune escape of eye-derived tumor cells was not due to down-regulation of either MHC class I or ICAM-1. Our data demonstrate that the immune-privileged environment within the eye induces a tumor escape phenotype that is not driven by selective T cell pressure. We predict that immune escape within the eye is driven by the unique ocular environment that permanently alters gene expression in eye-derived tumor cells.","['Chen, Peter W', 'Uno, Toshihiko', 'Ksander, Bruce R']","['Chen PW', 'Uno T', 'Ksander BR']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anterior Chamber/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Eye Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Escape/*genetics/*immunology']",2006/06/21 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/06/21 09:00'],"['2006/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/1/162 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.1.162 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jul 1;177(1):162-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.1.162.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phosphorylation of IgE receptors is followed by a series of intracellular signals, such as Ca(2+) mobilization, MAPK activation, and degranulation. Therefore, Lyn is a key molecule in the activation of mast cells, but the molecular mechanisms for the activation of Lyn are still unclear. Recently, it is suggested that the localization of Lyn in lipid rafts is critical for its activation in several cell lines, although the precise mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we found that flotillin-1, which is localized in lipid rafts, is involved in the process of Lyn activation. We obtained flotillin-1 knockdown (KD)(2) rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells, which express a low level of flotillin-1. In the flotillin-1 KD cells, we observed a significant decrease in Ca(2+) mobilization, the phosphorylation of ERKs, tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma-subunit of IgE receptor, and IgE receptor-mediated degranulation. We also found that flotillin-1 is constitutively associated with Lyn in lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cells, and Ag stimulation induced the augmentation of flotillin-1 binding to Lyn, resulting in enhancement of kinase activity of Lyn. These results suggest that flotillin-1 is an essential molecule in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell activation, and regulates the kinase activity of Lyn in lipid rafts.","['Kato, Naoto', 'Nakanishi, Mamoru', 'Hirashima, Naohide']","['Kato N', 'Nakanishi M', 'Hirashima N']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Tanabe-dori, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya 467-8603, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (flotillins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2006/06/21 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/06/21 09:00'],"['2006/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/1/147 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.1.147 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Jul 1;177(1):147-54. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.1.147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that such vectors induce gene transfer, both in vitro and in mice harboring human tumor xenografts, only through contact with target cells expressing MMPs that cleave the substrate introduced into the recombinant HA.

To examine the roles of the C/EBPbeta transactivation and regulatory domains in LPS-induced MCP-1 and IL-6 expression, we expressed various N-terminal truncations and deletions of C/EBPbeta in P388 murine B lymphoblasts, which lack endogenous C/EBPbeta expression and are normally unresponsive to LPS for expression of IL-6 and MCP-1. Unexpectedly, a region between amino acids 105 and 212 of C/EBPbeta that includes regulatory domains 1 and 2 facilitates C/EBPbeta activation of IL-6 expression, while having an inhibitory effect on MCP-1 expression. Thus, this region can mediate promoter-specific effects on cytokine and chemokine gene transcription.

However, higher-potency inducers than are available in currently identified short chain fatty acid derivatives are desirable for long-term use. Using several short-chain fatty acids with established gamma-globin induction activity, a pharmacophore template was constructed with the TFIT module of the flo software and used to select several new candidate compounds, three of which exhibited significant activity in a gamma-globin gene reporter transcriptional assay which detects only strong inducers. The data were used to construct a new pharmacophore and a 'pseudo' receptor around it. Six hundred and thirty low-molecular weight compounds were docked into this receptor model. Of 26 compounds selected and tested in functional assays, two compounds showed activity >500% over control levels and two had activity 200% over control range, significantly more active than previously identified short chain fatty acid derivative fetal globin gene inducers. Three compounds had less activity; the remainder showed moderate activity.

The pattern and location of insertions/duplications or deletions in CLL and their restriction to mutated IGHV rearranged genes strongly suggests that they resulted from somatic hypermutation. Their incidence in CLL is consistent with previous reports in normal, auto-reactive and neoplastic human B cells, thus seemingly indicating that these modifications generally arise without any particular disease-specific associations. A striking exception to this rule was identified in CLL IGHV3-21-expressing cases: one amino acid was deleted from the CDR2 region in 16/63 (25.4%) mutated CLL IGHV3-21 sequences (including public database-derived IGHV3-21 CLL cases + the present series) vs. only 2/257 (0.78%) public database-derived mutated non-CLL IGHV3-21 sequences; 15/16 CLL IGHV3-21 sequences carrying this deletion belonged to a subset with unique, shared HCDR3 and light chain CDR3 motifs. This finding further supports the idea of selective antigenic pressures playing a pathogenetic role in some CLL cases.","['Belessi, Chrysoula J', 'Davi, Frederic B', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas E', 'Degano, Massimo', 'Andreou, Thanassis M', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Laoutaris, Nikolaos P', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles Z', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Belessi CJ', 'Davi FB', 'Stamatopoulos KE', 'Degano M', 'Andreou TM', 'Moreno C', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Crespo M', 'Laoutaris NP', 'Montserrat E', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Anagnostopoulos AZ', 'Ghia P']","['Hematology Department, Nikea General Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200535751 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Jul;36(7):1963-74. doi: 10.1002/eji.200535751.,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB066974'],,,,,,,,

The main arguments against prophylaxis are the lack of survival benefit and the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. At present, clinical guidelines advise against routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis and current practice is to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics at the onset of fever in the neutropenic patient. However hospitalization, investigations and treatment all impact on resources as well as affecting patient quality of life, often resulting in chemotherapy delays and dose reductions. The benefits of prophylactic antibiotics have been emphasized by two major double-blind, placebo controlled trials with levofloxacin with very significant reductions in all infection-related events. Furthermore, the meta-analysis confirms a survival advantage and this is greatest with the use of fluoroquinolones. These benefits must be weighed against the problem of emerging antibiotic resistance. It has been shown that antibiotic prophylaxis does induce resistant organisms, but some studies have shown that the impact on clinical outcomes may not be as great as expected. Current evidence supports antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones in acute leukaemia and high-dose chemotherapy patients, commencing at the same time as chemotherapy. Febrile episodes are much commoner with the first cycle in patients with solid tumours or lymphoma having moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and these patients should be offered prophylaxis for at least the first cycle of chemotherapy. Further work is ongoing to facilitate the selection of patients with the greatest chance of benefit so that prophylaxis can be used efficiently.","['Lo, Nangi', 'Cullen, Michael']","['Lo N', 'Cullen M']","['University Hospital Birmingham Cancer Centre, Birmingham, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications/mortality']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.783 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2006 Sep;24(3):120-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.783.,40,,"['Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, responses obtained thus far have consisted of improvements in signs and symptoms without the elimination of a given disease. Toxicities derived from As2O3 are significant but manageable and reversible. However, the risk/benefit ratio of As2O3 in hematologic malignancies other than APL is still unclear.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is one of the most frequent salivary gland cancers among adults and children. METHODS: This survey was conducted among 34 French pediatric oncology departments. From 1980 to 2000, 18 cases were reported. RESULTS: Treatment included surgery or radiotherapy, or both. The 5-year survival rate was 93.7%. Eleven patients had been previously treated by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for a first malignant tumor, specifically, lymphoid leukemia (n = 4), lymphoma (n = 3), brain tumor (n = 2), sarcoma (n = 1), and retinoblastoma (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: MEC is very rare in the pediatric age group. Treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor plus radiotherapy, according to histologic staging. MEC has a good prognosis in young patients.

In a routine cervico-vaginal Papanicolau smear, abundant atypical lymphoid cells with round-to-oval nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios was observed. The nuclei of these cells had fine and dark chromatin and thickened nuclear membranes, with one or several nucleoli being visible. Biopsy under colposcope was performed, and a diagnosis of relapse of ALL was confirmed. The ongoing genital bleeding presented a problem with clinical management of the patient. It was decided to proceed with hysterectomy to end that problem and thereafter proceed with therapy directed against the leukemia.

The serum activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was moderately increased at admission (4712 U/L), and remained increased despite normal to minimally increased activities of liver- and muscle-specific enzymes. The heifer was serologically negative for BLV. Because of declining condition and poor prognosis, the heifer was euthanized on day 37 after presentation. At necropsy and on histologic examination, epitheliotropic and folliculotropic cutaneous lymphoma, with generalized involvement of lymph nodes and spleen and infiltration of liver and kidney, was diagnosed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were treated between 1994 and 2002. Patients underwent induction therapy with five cycles of standard agents, resection of the primary tumor and local radiation, and two consecutive courses of myeloablative therapy (including total-body irradiation) with PBSCR. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients have experienced relapse or died. Median follow-up time among the 46 patients who remain alive without progression is 5.6 years (range, 15.1 months to 9.9 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 5 years from diagnosis was 47% (95% CI, 36% to 56%), and PFS rate at 7 years was 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%). Overall survival rate was 60% (95% CI, 48% to 69%) and 53% (95% CI, 40% to 64%) at 5 and 7 years, respectively. The 5- and 7- year PFS rates from time of first transplantation for 82 patients who completed both transplants were 54% (95% CI, 42% to 64%) and 52% (95% CI, 40% to 63%), respectively. Five patients died from treatment-related toxicity after tandem transplantation. Relapse occurred in 37 (42%) of 89 patients, mainly within 3 years of transplantation and primarily in diffuse osseous sites. No primary CNS relapse or secondary leukemia was seen. One patient developed synovial cell sarcoma 8 years after therapy. CONCLUSION: High-dose therapy with tandem autologous stem-cell rescue is effective for treating high-risk neuroblastoma, with encouraging long-term survival. CNS relapse and secondary malignancies are rare after this therapy.","['George, Rani E', 'Li, Shuli', 'Medeiros-Nancarrow, Cheryl', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Marcus, Karen', 'Shamberger, Robert C', 'Pulsipher, Michael', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Diller, Lisa']","['George RE', 'Li S', 'Medeiros-Nancarrow C', 'Neuberg D', 'Marcus K', 'Shamberger RC', 'Pulsipher M', 'Grupp SA', 'Diller L']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. rani_george@dfci.harvard.edu']",,['eng'],['R21 CA110516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Neuroblastoma/*therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/18/2891 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6986 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jun 20;24(18):2891-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6986.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They act on specific target genes by recruiting protein complexes that deacetylate or acetylate histones and modify chromatin status. The regulation of this process is affected by histone methyltransferases, which can inhibit or activate transcription depending on their amino acid target. We show here that retinoic acid treatment of hematopoietic cells induces the expression of BTG2. Overexpression of this protein increases RARalpha transcriptional activity and the differentiation response to retinoic acid of myeloid leukemia cells and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In the absence of retinoic acid, BTG2 is present in the RARalpha transcriptional complex, together with the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 and Sin3A. Overexpressed BTG2 increases PRMT1 participation in the RARalpha protein complex on the RARbeta promoter, a target gene model, and enhances gene-specific histone H4 arginine methylation. Upon RA treatment Sin3A, BTG2, and PRMT1 detach from RARalpha and thereafter BGT2 and PRMT1 are driven to the cytoplasm. These events prime histone H4 demethylation and acetylation. Overall, our data show that BTG2 contributes to retinoic acid activity by favoring differentiation through a gene-specific modification of histone H4 arginine methylation and acetylation levels.","['Passeri, Daniela', 'Marcucci, Antonella', 'Rizzo, Giovanni', 'Billi, Monia', 'Panigada, Maddalena', 'Leonardi, Luca', 'Tirone, Felice', 'Grignani, Francesco']","['Passeri D', 'Marcucci A', 'Rizzo G', 'Billi M', 'Panigada M', 'Leonardi L', 'Tirone F', 'Grignani F']","['Patologia Generale and Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, Perugia University, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/13/5023 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01360-05 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Jul;26(13):5023-32. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01360-05.,,,,,PMC1489145,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The NK cell line KHYG-1 was irradiated at 1 gray (Gy) to 50 Gy with gamma-irradiation, and evaluated for cell proliferation, cell survival, and cytotoxicity against tumor targets. RESULTS: We showed that a dose of at least 10 Gy was sufficient to inhibit proliferation of KHYG-1 within the first day but not its cytolytic activity. While 50 Gy had an apoptotic effect in the first hours after irradiation, the killing of K562 and HL60 targets was not different from non-irradiated cells but was reduced for the Ph + myeloid leukemia lines, EM-2 and EM-3. CONCLUSIONS: gamma-irradiation (at least 10 Gy) of KHYG-1 inhibits cell proliferation but does not diminish its enhanced cytolytic activity against several tumor targets.

Treatment of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces the cells to differentiate into monocyte/macrophage-like cells. In this study, following TPA treatment, there was a significant increase in mu opioid peptide receptor (MOPR) mRNA levels in the differentiated HL-60 cells as measured by quantitative-competitive RT-PCR (QC-RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. Morphine's inhibition of forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP confirmed the functionality of the MOPR. TPA-induced differentiation also significantly enhanced the binding activities of two transcriptional factors, AP-1 and NFkB. Prolonged treatment of the TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells with morphine down-regulated MOPR mRNA expression and decreased the binding activities of AP-1 and NFkB, both of which were naloxone reversible. Thus, the direct correlation between AP-1 and NFkB binding activities and MOPR expression in HL-60 cells following TPA-induced differentiation as well as in TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells given prolonged treatment with morphine suggests that transcriptional factors, such as AP-1 and NFkB, may play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of MOPR expression in immune cells.","['Beltran, Jose A', 'Peek, Jennifer', 'Chang, Sulie L']","['Beltran JA', 'Peek J', 'Chang SL']","['Department of Biology, Seton Hall University, McNulty Hall, Room 215, South Orange, NJ 07079, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K02 DA 016149/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA 007058/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Narcotic Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid, mu)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Morphine/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Naloxone/pharmacology', 'Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Opioid, mu/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(06)00115-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2006.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2006 Aug;6(8):1331-40. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2006.03.017.

Surgical resection is the only curative treatment; no effective systemic treatment is available. We evaluated imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as a potential drug for systemic treatment of MTC, in 2 MTC-derived cell lines expressing multiple endocrine neoplasia-associated mutant RET receptors. METHODS: We determined RET expression and Y1062 phosphorylation using Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We determined the effects on cell proliferation by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with annexin V/propidium iodide staining to study imatinib-induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell death. RESULTS: Imatinib inhibited RET Y1062 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner after 1.5 hours of exposure. After 16 hours both RET Y1062 phosphorylation and protein expression levels were affected. Dose-dependent decreases in cell proliferation of both cell lines after exposure to imatinib with inhibitory concentration of 50% levels of 23 +/- 2 micromol/L and 25 +/- 4 micromol/L were seen. These values are high, compared with those for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We further could show that imatinib induced cell-cycle arrest, and apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib inhibits RET-mediated MTC cell growth affecting RET protein levels in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of imatinib necessary to inhibit RET in vitro, however, makes it impossible to conclude that imatinib monotherapy will be a good option for systemic therapy of MTC.","['de Groot, J W B', 'Plaza Menacho, I', 'Schepers, H', 'Drenth-Diephuis, L J', 'Osinga, J', 'Plukker, J Th M', 'Links, Th P', 'Eggen, B J L', 'Hofstra, R M W']","['de Groot JW', 'Plaza Menacho I', 'Schepers H', 'Drenth-Diephuis LJ', 'Osinga J', 'Plukker JT', 'Links TP', 'Eggen BJ', 'Hofstra RM']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Carcinoma, Medullary/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2a/*genetics', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2b/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0039-6060(05)00722-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surg.2005.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2006 Jun;139(6):806-14. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2005.10.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression of AID, however, mediates generalized hypermutation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here, we present evidence that AID is induced outside the germinal center in response to infection by the Abelson murine leukemia virus. The genotoxic activity of virally induced AID resulted in checkpoint kinase-1 (chk1) phosphorylation and ultimately restricted the proliferation of the infected cell. At the same time, it induced NKG2D ligand upregulation, which alerts the immune system to the presence of virally transformed cells. Hence, in addition to its known function in immunoglobulin diversification, AID is active in innate defense against a transforming retrovirus.","['Gourzi, Polyxeni', 'Leonova, Tatyana', 'Papavasiliou, F Nina']","['Gourzi P', 'Leonova T', 'Papavasiliou FN']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology, Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology, Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology, Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021.

The specific role of Noxa became apparent during glucose limitation and involves interaction with the labile Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1. Knockdown of Noxa or Mcl-1 results in protection or susceptibility, respectively, to apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation.

GLUT-1 is a twelve-transmembrane cell surface receptor with six extracellular (ECL) and seven intracellular domains. To analyze HTLV-1 cytotropism, we utilized polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the large extracellular domain of GLUT-1. The antibodies caused significant blocking of envelope (Env)-mediated fusion and pseudotyped virus infection of HeLa cells but had no significant effect on infection of U87 cells. This differential effect correlated with the detection of high-level surface expression of GLUT-1 on HeLa cells and very weak staining of U87 cells. To investigate this in terms of viral cytotropism, we cloned GLUT-1 cDNA from U87 cells and isolated two different versions of cDNA clones: the wild-type sequence (encoding 492 residues) and a mutant cDNA with a 5-base pair deletion (GLUT-1Delta5) between nucleotides 1329 and 1333. The deletion, also detected in genomic DNA, resulted in a frame-shift and premature termination producing a truncated protein of 463 residues. Transfection of the wild-type GLUT-1 but not GLUT-1Delta5 cDNA into CHO cells resulted in efficient surface expression of the human GLUT-1. Co-expression of GLUT-1 with GLUT-1Delta5 produces a trans-inhibition by GLUT-1Delta5 of GLUT-1-mediated HTLV-1 envelope (Env)-mediated fusion. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated physical interaction of the wild-type and mutant proteins. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated lower GLUT-1 RNA expression in U87 cells. We propose two mechanisms to account for the impaired cell surface expression of GLUT-1 on U87 cells: low GLUT-1 RNA expression and the formation of GLUT-1/GLUT-1Delta5 heterodimers that are retained intracellularly. Significant RNAi-mediated reduction of endogenous GLUT-1 expression impaired HTLV-1 Env-mediated fusion with HeLa cells but not with U87 cells. We propose a GLUT-1-independent mechanism of HTLV-1 infection of U87 cells. The results may have important implications for HTLV-1 neurotropism and pathogenesis.","['Jin, Qingwen', 'Agrawal, Lokesh', 'Vanhorn-Ali, Zainab', 'Alkhatib, Ghalib']","['Jin Q', 'Agrawal L', 'Vanhorn-Ali Z', 'Alkhatib G']","['Department of Neurology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210029, China.']",,['eng'],"['R21 CA098095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA98095-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytoma/pathology/*virology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Glioblastoma/pathology/*virology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/analysis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00305-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Sep 15;353(1):99-110. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.05.003.

The interaction between the cytokine stem cell factor (SCF) and its cognate receptor, the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), plays a central role in regulating MC growth and differentiation. Whereas germline and somatically acquired activating mutations of KIT have been identified in SM, the issue as to whether individual KIT mutation(s) are necessary and sufficient to cause MC transformation remains unclear based on currently available data. Activating mutations of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (FIP1 L1-PDGFRA) are identified in a significant number of SM cases that have associated eosinophilia. To date, as with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, activating mutations of KIT and PDGFRA appear to be alternative and mutually exclusive genetic events in SM. The World Health Organization has specified criteria for classification of SM into six major subtypes: cutaneous mastocytosis, indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematological non-mast-cell disorder (SM-AHNMD), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), mast cell leukemia, and mast cell sarcoma. The ability to molecularly classify individual SM cases based on the presence or absence of specific mutations allows for molecularly targeted therapy in a growing number of cases. Imatinib mesylate therapy might result in complete remission of SM cases with wild-type KIT, certain KIT mutations, such as F522C, or the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, but not of D816V-KIT-bearing SM. For the latter, interferon-alpha and 2-CdA are potential first- and second-line therapeutic options. Other drugs under investigation include novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as NF-kappaB inhibitors, which might display greater selectivity towards D816V-KIT as compared to wild type KIT. The pathogenesis of mastocytosis, its major clinical subtypes, and recent treatment advances are discussed in this chapter.","['Pardanani, A', 'Akin, C', 'Valent, P']","['Pardanani A', 'Akin C', 'Valent P']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Mayo Building W10A, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

CNL is now recognized as a distinct entity among the chronic myeloproliferative disorders and CMML is included within the new category of 'myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases' (MDS/MPD). Predominant neutrophilia defines CNL whereas CMML is defined by predominant and monocytosis.

The exclusion of underlying bcr/abl-driven oncogenesis is an essential component in the diagnosis of these chronic leukemic processes. The optimal therapy for both CNL and CMML remains uncertain. Current management decisions are based on small studies or extrapolated from therapeutic strategies that are effective in similar chronic, clonal myeloid disorders.

However, over the last decade, significant advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of eosinophilic disorders have shifted an increasing proportion of cases from this idiopathic HES 'pool' to genetically defined eosinophilic diseases with recurrent molecular abnormalities. The majority of these genetic lesions result in constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinases, the phenotypic consequence of which is an eosinophilia-associated myeloid disorder. Most notable among these is the recent discovery of the cryptic FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene fusion in karyotypically normal patients with systemic mast cell disease with eosinophilia or idiopathic HES, redefining these diseases as clonal eosinophilias. Rearrangements involving PDGFRA and PDGFRB in eosinophilic chronic myeloproliferative disorders, and of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the 8p11 stem cell myeloproliferative syndrome constitute additional examples of specific genetic alterations linked to clonal eosinophilia. The identification of populations of aberrant T-lymphocytes secreting eosinophilopoietic cytokines such as interleukin-5 establish a pathophysiologic basis for cases of lymphocyte-mediated hypereosinophilia. This recent revival in understanding the biologic basis of eosinophilic disorders has permitted more genetic specificity in the classification of these diseases, and has translated into successful therapeutic approaches with targeted agents such as imatinib mesylate and recombinant anti-IL-5 antibody.","['Gotlib, Jason', 'Cross, N C P', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Gotlib J', 'Cross NC', 'Gilliland DG']","['Stanford Cancer Center, 875 Blake Wilbur Drive, Room 2327B, Stanford, CA 94305-5821, USA. jason.gotlib@stanford.edu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In conclusion, BM biopsy should be considered as major diagnostic tool for evaluation and follow-up of patients enrolled in prospective studies.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Vardiman, J']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Vardiman J']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str.9, D-50924 Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In turn, myeloid malignancies are broadly categorized into either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid disorder (CMD), depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of AML-defining cytomorphologic and cytogenetic features. The CMD are traditionally classified by their morphologic appearances into discrete clinicopathologic entities based primarily on subjective technologies. It has now become evident that most CMD represent clonal stem cell processes where the primary oncogenic event has been characterized in certain instances; Bcr/Abl in chronic myeloid leukemia, FIP1L1-PDGFRA or c-kit(D816V) in systemic mastocytosis, rearrangements of PDGFRB in chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and rearrangements of FGFR1 in stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome. In addition, Bcr/Abl-negative classic myeloproliferative disorders are characterized by recurrent JAK2(V617F) mutations, whereas other mutations affecting the RAS signaling pathway molecules have been associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

However, subclinical (and also clinical) cardiotoxicity occurs below these empirical doses and may begin to induce cardiac damage in an unpredictable and progressive manner after the first dose of treatment. As a result, treatment with anthracyclines may be withdrawn from patients prematurely or substituted with less efficacious alternative therapies. Through discontinuing further use of anthracyclines, relapsed patients previously treated with these agents may consequently be treated with second-line therapy that is less effective and possibly less well tolerated.

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in long-term survivors of childhood cancer is characterized by reduced left ventricular wall thickness and mass, which is indicative of decreased cardiac muscle and depressed left ventricular contractility which is indicative of unhealthy heart muscle. Risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include high cumulative anthracycline doses, high anthracycline dose intensity, and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines can exacerbate anthracycline-induced cardiac tissue damage. Several studies have shown that cardiomyopathy disease progression can be delayed in adults by using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril. Studies in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer showed that enalapril has significant benefits in preventing cardiac functional deterioration on a short-term basis, but this is not sustained. Anthracycline-associated cardiotoxic effects can be combatted by preventing cardiac injury during chemotherapy administration. There is evidence that dexrazoxane significantly reduces the cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and epirubicin in adult patients with a wide range of tumor types. A study of the efficacy of dexrazoxane in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children and adolescents with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showed that significantly fewer dexrazoxane-treated patients (21%) had elevated serum cardiac troponin (a biomarker of acute myocardial injury) levels than patients treated with chemotherapy alone (50%; P <.001). Dexrazoxane was also shown to have no effect on the event-free survival rate at 2.5 years, emphasizing that it does not detrimentally affect the efficacy of anthracycline therapy.","['Lipshultz, Steven E']",['Lipshultz SE'],"['Department of Pediatrics, and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.

Cardiac damage has been shown at cumulative doses as low as 200 mg/m2, well below levels currently assumed to induce injury. The widespread use of anthracyclines in childhood leukemia has resulted in an improved long-term prognosis; however, these patients are subsequently at high risk of developing long-term cardiac damage, with studies suggesting as many as 65% of survivors of childhood leukemia will develop cardiac abnormalities. Middle aged and elderly patients who are prone to cardiac disease may be more vulnerable to the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines.

By screening about 1200 murine leukemia virus (MLV)-induced lymphomas, we found proviral insertions at the Icsbp locus in 14 tumors, 13 of which were mature B-cell lymphomas or plasmacytomas. Only one was a T-cell lymphoma, although such tumors constituted about half of the samples screened. This indicates that the Icsbp locus can play a specific role in the development of mature B-lineage malignancies. Two proviral insertions in the last Icsbp exon were found to act by a poly(A)-insertion mechanism. The remaining insertions were found within or outside Icsbp. Since our results showed expression of Icsbp RNA and protein in all end-stage tumor samples, a simple tumor suppressor function of ICSBP is not likely. Interestingly, proviral insertions at Icsbp have not been reported from previous extensive screenings of mature B-cell lymphomas induced by endogenous MLVs. We propose that ICSBP might be involved in an early modulation of an immune response to exogenous MLVs that might also play a role in proliferation of the mature B-cell lymphomas.","['Ma, Shi Liang', 'Sorensen, Annette Balle', 'Kunder, Sandra', 'Sorensen, Karina Dalsgaard', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Morris, David W', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Ma SL', 'Sorensen AB', 'Kunder S', 'Sorensen KD', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Morris DW', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.F.

Since STI571 may reverse multidrug-resistance of K562/MDR cells in vitro, we studied the effect of STI571 on multidrug-resistant K562 cells in vivo. METHODS: Multidrug-resistant human leukemia cell line K562-n/VCR expresses both bcr/abl fusion gene and multi-drug resistance (mdr1) gene. It is a vincristine resistant cell line subcloned from the vincristine (VCR) sensitive cell line K562-n induced by vincristine in vitro. K562-n and K562-n/VCR cells were inoculated subcutaneously into both sides of nude mice breast (5 x 106 cells/each) to establish a human leukemia xenograft model. The incidence and volume of tumor were observed. In the tumor-bearing nude mice, anti-tumor drugs vincristine, daunorubicin (DNR), STI571, and STI571 plus VCR for the treatment of mdr1 and bcr/abl double positive leukemia were studied respectively. RESULTS: The tumor incidence was 100% in the nude mice inoculated with either K562-n or K562-n/VCR. The transcription of the mdr1 gene and expression of P-gp were negative in K562-n cells but positive in K562-n/VCR cells. The intracellular accumulation of DNR in K562-n cells was higher than that in K562-n/VCR cells (P < 0.05). The tumor incidence of K562-n/VCR cells in nude mice was much higher than that of K562-n cells in chemotherapy groups, and the mean volume of the tumors was also larger (P < 0.05). STI571 combined with VCR significantly suppressed the proliferation of K562-n/VCR cells. CONCLUSIONS: The MDR characteristics of K562-n/VCR in vivo were the same as in vitro. STI571 had a significant tumor-suppressing effect on VCR-sensitive leukemia cells and a moderate effect on MDR leukemia cells. VCR combined with STI571 had an excellent tumor-suppressing effect on both K562-n/VCR and K562-n in the human-nude mice xenograft model.","['Gao, Lei', 'Chen, Li', 'Fei, Xin-hong', 'Qiu, Hui-ying', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Wang, Jian-min']","['Gao L', 'Chen L', 'Fei XH', 'Qiu HY', 'Zhou H', 'Wang JM']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2006 Jun 5;119(11):911-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms associated with this environmental influence remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in U937 cell line, to find out the relations between leukemia drug resistance and the MSCs. METHODS: U937 cells were cultured in suspension or grew adherently with MSCs. The cell growth curve was drawn and the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry. Apoptosis and sensitivity of U937 to daunoblastina (DNR) were quantified by DNA ladder detection and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. The gene expression profile chip technology was used to determine and analyze the changes in apoptosis-related gene expression after adherent culture and the expression of MDR1 mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the same time. RESULTS: In the adherent culture, the proliferation of the U937 cells was inhibited, the G0/G1 phase cells increased (F = 64.9726, P < 0.0001), G2/M phase cells were decreased (F = 98.1361, P < 0.0001) and the natural apoptosis rate was decreased (F = 24.0866, P < 0.0001) compared with those in the suspended culture. U937 cell viability was enhanced and cell apoptosis was blocked during DNR treatment in adherent culture with MSCs. Thirty-nine differently expressed genes were screened from the 487 apoptosis related genes in the adherent culture U937 cells. Among the 37 upregulated genes, Bcl-XL was upregulated most significantly. Two genes were downregulated. Adherent culture did not induce MDR1 mRNA expression in U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs play a role in modulating the proliferation of U937 cells and response of U937 cells to DNR, and Bcl-XL apoptosis-inhibiting gene may be most important in determining the sensitivity of leukemic cells to treatment, which is not related to MDR1.","['Lin, Yu-mei', 'Zhang, Gui-zhen', 'Leng, Zong-xiang', 'Lu, Zhen-xia', 'Bu, Li-sha', 'Gao, Shen', 'Yang, Shao-juan']","['Lin YM', 'Zhang GZ', 'Leng ZX', 'Lu ZX', 'Bu LS', 'Gao S', 'Yang SJ']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology China-Japan United Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130031, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects']",2006/06/20 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2006 Jun 5;119(11):905-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The positive rate of SHP-1 and Caspase-1, 3 gene in acute leukemia was 33.3%, 80.0% and 100.0%. The positive rate of SHP-1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-blastic phase and CML-chronic phase was 0.0%, 37.5%.

METHODS: Quantitative analysis of DC was performed with multiplex PCR amplification of short tandem repeats markers (STR-PCR) and capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence detection in 84 patients who received allo-HSCT. Sequential chimerism both prior to and following adoptive immunotherapy were evaluated in 16 patients. RESULTS: Increase of mixed chimerism and decrease of DC < 90% were found in 22 of the 84 patients. Six of the 22 patients who did not receive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) all died of relapse. Adoptive immunotherapy was used to treat the remaining 16 patients. Before the time of relapse or graft rejection, STR-PCR indicated decrease of DC in 12 of the 16 patients, with levels ranging from 24.8% - 86.2%. A response to immunotherapy was achieved in 11 of the 16 patients (68.8%). In these patients, the value of DC increased with conversion to a predominant donor profile (> or =90%). 6 of the 11 patients converted to stable full donor chimerism (FDC) and 5 of the 11 patients to transformed stable mixed chimerism (MC) shortly after immunotherapy. All these 11 patients who responded to immunotherapy developed graft versus host disease (GVHD). While in the patient without response, the level of DC decreased persistently or declined after a transient increase. Three patients without response received second DLI but still failed to response. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that sequential and quantitative monitoring of DC can identify the patients who have high risk of relapse or graft failure and can be used to guide adoptive immunotherapy at early stage to improve the response of immunotherapy in those patients who undergo cytogenetic or molecular relapse. Furthermore the serial and quantitative detection of DC has been shown to be a valuable tool to evaluate early the efficacy of treatment. As well, it can present a rational basis for treatment intensification in patients who did not respond to first-line adoptive immunotherapy treatment.","['Tang, Xiao-wen', 'Wu, De-pei', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Zhu, Zi-ling', 'Chang, Wei-rong', 'Ruan, Chang-geng']","['Tang XW', 'Wu DP', 'Sun AN', 'Zhu ZL', 'Chang WR', 'Ruan CG']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China. xwtang1@sina.com']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/06/20 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2006 May;45(5):359-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The changes of body weight and various systems of body were observed after treatment with As(2)O(3) injection. The arsenic content in blood, urine and hair was detected with atom absorbed-spectrum analysis. RESULTS: Mild reactions were observed in 57.43% (147/256) of the patients and they could subside after cessation of arsenic treatment or allotherapy. Chronic mild poisoning manifestations including arsenic furuncle, liver dysfunction and peripheral nerve injury were found in 2.73% (7/256) of the patients and they subsided gradually after treatment. Chronic severe poisoning was found in 1.17% of the patients and all of them died of liver failure. As(2)O(3) might cause decrease of peripheral blood WBC in catabatic patients. There was no infection after allopathy without ceasing arsenic medication. The results showed that As(2)O(3) could distribute over and discharge from the plasma without accumulation in blood. The results also demonstrated the main route of excretion for As(2)O(3) is through urine and there is definite accumulation in the hair 50 days after treatment. CONCLUSION: Most of the side effects of As(2)O(3) are mild and recoverable. Allotherapy could be effective to relieve the complications without stopping arsenic medication. A few patients with complicating hepatitis may suffer from chronic poisoning. As(2)O(3) may cause increase of peripheral blood WBC in induced catabatic APL patients. The side effects must be prevented early.","['Wu, Nan', 'Hu, Long-hu', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Fan, Sheng-jin', 'Wang, Yan', 'Han, Xue-ying']","['Wu N', 'Hu LH', 'Zhou J', 'Fan SJ', 'Wang Y', 'Han XY']","[""Department of Hematology, The 12th People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou 510620, China. gzNanwu@sina.com.cn""]",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2006/06/20 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2006 Apr;45(4):310-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A longitudinal study was carried out between February 1999 and November 2001 in seven commercial dairy farms in Argentina using 1535 lactating cows. Time-interval parameters were analysed using a parametric survival model with shared frailty, time until infection was analysed using a Bayesian interval-censoring survival model and the infection transmission parameter (beta) was estimated by a generalized linear model. The reproduction ratio (R0) was calculated. In total, 1000 cows tested positive and 494 tested negative. The predicted median age at infection was 4.6 years for seroconverted cows. For infected herds, the proportion of positive calves was as high as for infected cows and showed a large proportion of infected breeding heifers. Peaks in the overall average incidence per season-year were observed during autumn and spring. Results reveal that the period around parturition is a high-risk period. Moreover, heavily infected herds seem to have an increased proportion of young stock infected. The overall beta was estimated as 2.9/year (95% CI 1.9-3.7) and combined with a relatively long infectious period it resulted in a high reproductive ratio (R0=8.9). Therefore, a high effectiveness of control measures needs to be achieved to eradicate the disease.","['Monti, G E', 'Frankena, K', 'De Jong, M C M']","['Monti GE', 'Frankena K', 'De Jong MC']","['Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology Group, Wageningen Institute of Animal Sciences, Wageningen, The Netherlands. gustavomonti@uach.cl']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Epidemiol Infect,Epidemiology and infection,8703737,,IM,"['Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Cattle', 'Disease Outbreaks/*veterinary', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/*veterinary', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/pathogenicity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Models, Statistical']",2006/06/20 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2006/06/20 09:00'],"['2006/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0950268806006637 [pii]', '10.1017/S0950268806006637 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Infect. 2007 Feb;135(2):228-37. doi: 10.1017/S0950268806006637.

The expressed doubts apply not only to possible health effects, but also to biophysical mechanisms by which those effects occur. The paper presents these controversies. In general opinion there is as yet no conclusive evidence to consider EMF as a factor harmful to health (may be except the relationship between power frequence magnetic field and some neoplastic diseases, especially leukemia in children). It is also unknown which of biophysical mechanisms may be the underlying reason for possible health effects. All these mean that studies in this area should be continued.

METHODS: The gene expression patterns in NB4 cells pre- and post-treatment with As4S4 were analyzed by cDNA microarray, and differentially expressed genes related with apoptosis were identified. The mRNA expression levels of these apoptosis related genes in the peripheral blood of APL patients treated with As4S4 pre- and post-remission were examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among the differentially expressed genes in NB4 cells pre- and post-treatment with As4S4, two genes were related with cellular apoptosis, which were Apaf-1 and PNAS-2. Apaf1 ratio between pre- and post- As4S4 in NB4 cells was 2.910, PNAS-2 ratio was 0.420. RT-PCR results showed that the expression ratios of Apaf-1, caspase-9 and PNAS-2 in APL patients pre- and post-remission were 2.31 and 3.21, 0.99 respectively. CONCLUSION: As4S4 induced cellular apoptosis in NB4 cells involves the expression changes of the two genes: the up-regulation of Apaf1 and down-regulation of PNAS-2. The increased expressions of Apaf1 and caspase-9 indicate that As4S4 induced apoptosis in APL cells is through mitochondrial pathway, but not the death-receptor pathway. The role played by PNAS-2 in cellular apoptosis needs to be clarified.","['Teng, Zhi-ping', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Zhu, Hong-hu', 'Hao, Hong-ying', 'Qin, Xiao-ying', 'Hao, Le', 'Xu, Hong', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Teng ZP', 'Zhang P', 'Zhu HH', 'Hao HY', 'Qin XY', 'Hao L', 'Xu H', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hemotology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. tengzhipiong@sina.com""]",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Significant apoptosis was observed, concomitant with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL downregulation, mitochondrial instability and caspase-3 activation. AML1-ETO oncoprotein was degraded in parallel to caspase-3 activation. EriB-mediated apoptosis was associated with NF-kappaB inactivation by preventing NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and inducing IkappaBalpha cleavage, and disturbance of MAPK pathway by downregulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activating AP-1. Without affecting normal hematopoietic progenitor cells proliferation, EriB was effective on primary t(8;21) leukemia blasts and caused AML1-ETO degradation.

In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in Ara-C resistance, the gene expression profile of Ara-C-resistant K562 human myeloid leukemia cells (K562/AC cells) was compared to that of Ara-C-sensitive K562 cells (K562 cells) by using a cDNA microarray platform. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene was upregulated in K562/AC cells. The biological significance of IGF-I overexpression was further examined in vitro. When K562 cells were incubated with IGF-I ligand, they were protected from apoptosis induced by Ara-C. In contrast, a significant inhibition of growth and increase of apoptosis of K562/AC cells were induced by IGF-I receptor neutralizing antibody, or suramin, a nonspecific growth factor antagonist. Moreover, from the analysis of 27 AML patients, we have shown that IGF-I expression levels are higher in patients at refractory stage, after Ara-C combined chemotherapy, than those in patients at diagnosis. These results suggest that the inhibition of IGF-I and its downstream pathway is a valuable therapeutic approach to overcome Ara-C resistance in AML.","['Abe, Shori', 'Funato, Tadao', 'Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Yamamoto, Joji', 'Tomiya, Yasuo', 'Yamada-Fujiwara, Minami', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Kameoka, Junichi', 'Kaku, Mitsuo', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Sasaki, Takeshi']","['Abe S', 'Funato T', 'Takahashi S', 'Yokoyama H', 'Yamamoto J', 'Tomiya Y', 'Yamada-Fujiwara M', 'Ishizawa K', 'Kameoka J', 'Kaku M', 'Harigae H', 'Sasaki T']","['Department of Rheumatology and Hematology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/metabolism', 'Suramin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/06/17 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2006/06/17 09:00'],"['2006/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/tjem/209.217 [pii]', '10.1620/tjem.209.217 [doi]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2006 Jul;209(3):217-28. doi: 10.1620/tjem.209.217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of p53 in primary tumors and cell lines is mediated by several molecular mechanisms, including deletions and rearrangements. However, generation of a p53 fusion gene has not yet been reported. Here we report a novel p53/an autosomal homolog of the fragile X mental retardation (FXR2) chimeric gene generated by an interstitial deletion. Western blot analyses have shown that the p53/FXR2 protein is indeed expressed in a Down syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, CMK11-5 cells. To investigate the properties of the p53/FXR2 protein, we observed its subcellular localization. Flag-tagged expression vectors were transfected into COS-7 cells and the proteins were stained with an anti-Flag antibody. The p53/FXR2 protein was expressed at high levels in the cytoplasm, whereas wild-type p53 and FXR2 were localized primarily in the nucleus and in the periphery of the nucleus, respectively. Treatment with a topoisomerase II inhibitor, VP16, failed to induce expression of a p53 target gene, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF-1/CIP1), in CMK11-5 cells, and transient transfection analysis showed that the p53/FXR2 protein failed to transactivate the p21(WAF-1/CIP1) promoter.

Major responses associated with cytogenetic complete response developed in patients receiving prolonged dosing schedules of aza-CR.

Six of six responding patients with pretreatment methylation of p15 or CDH-1 promoters reversed methylation during the first cycle of therapy (methylation-specific PCR), whereas none of six nonresponders showed any demethylation.

In the present work, the effect of retinoids on the leukemic hypereosinophilia-derived EoL-1 cell line and on primary HES-derived cells has been investigated. We show that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibits eosinophil colony formation of HES-derived bone marrow cells and is a powerful inducer of apoptosis of the EoL-1 cell line. Apoptosis was shown in the nanomolar concentration range by phosphatidylserine externalization, proapoptotic shift of the Bcl-2/Bak ratio, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases, and cellular morphology. Unlike in other ATRA-sensitive myeloid leukemia models, apoptosis was rapid and was not preceded by terminal cell differentiation. Use of isoform-selective synthetic retinoids indicated that retinoic acid receptor-alpha-dependent signaling is sufficient to induce apoptosis of EoL-1 cells. Our work shows that the scope of ATRA-induced apoptosis of malignancies may be wider within the myeloid lineage than thought previously, that the EoL-1 cell line constitutes a new and unique model for the study of ATRA-induced cell death, and that ATRA may have potential for the management of clonal HES.","['Robert, Carine', 'Delva, Laurent', 'Balitrand, Nicole', 'Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Papp, Bela']","['Robert C', 'Delva L', 'Balitrand N', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Masszi T', 'Chomienne C', 'Papp B']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR-S 718, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, University of Paris VII, Paris, France.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/biosynthesis']",2006/06/17 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/17 09:00'],"['2006/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/12/6336 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0078 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jun 15;66(12):6336-44. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified TSG101 as a binding partner for Bcr. Because TSG101 is a subunit of the mammalian endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), which regulates protein sorting during endosomal trafficking, this association suggests that Bcr may have a related cellular function. The docking site for TSG101 has been mapped to the COOH terminus of Bcr, indicating that this interaction may be disrupted in CML. Overexpression studies with full-length TSG101 and Bcr reveal that this interaction can be recapitulated in mammalian cells. The association can also be observed between natively expressed proteins in a panel of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines, where a second subunit of the ESCRT complex, vacuolar sorting protein 28 (Vps28), was also found to interact with Bcr. Both Bcr and TSG101 exhibit a punctate cytoplasmic distribution and seem to colocalize in HeLa cells, which would be consistent with an in vivo association. Bacterially purified Bcr and TSG101 also bind, suggesting that the interaction is direct and is not dependent on ubiquitination. Disruption of the endosomal pathway with an ATPase-defective Vps4 mutant results in the cellular redistribution of Bcr, and suppression of Bcr in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA impairs epidermal growth factor receptor turnover. Taken together, these observations suggest that Bcr is a component of the mammalian ESCRT complexes and plays an important role in cellular trafficking of growth factor receptors.","['Olabisi, Oyenike O', 'Mahon, Gwendolyn M', 'Kostenko, Elena V', 'Liu, Zhuoming', 'Ozer, Harvey L', 'Whitehead, Ian P']","['Olabisi OO', 'Mahon GM', 'Kostenko EV', 'Liu Z', 'Ozer HL', 'Whitehead IP']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and University Hospital Cancer Center, New Jersey Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA097066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA117049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA113049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG04821/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (VPS28 protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (VPS4A protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/06/17 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/17 09:00'],"['2006/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/12/6250 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0536 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jun 15;66(12):6250-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because aberrant hypermethylation may be used as a marker for disease, a sensitive method for the global detection of DNA methylation events is of particular importance. We describe a novel and robust technique, called methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation, which allows the unbiased genome-wide profiling of CpG methylation in limited DNA samples. The approach is based on a recombinant, antibody-like protein that efficiently binds native CpG-methylated DNA. In combination with CpG island microarrays, the technique was used to identify >100 genes with aberrantly methylated CpG islands in three myeloid leukemia cell lines. Interestingly, within all hypermethylation targets, genes involved in transcriptional regulation were significantly overrepresented. More than half of the identified genes were absent in microarray expression studies in either leukemia or normal monocytes, indicating that hypermethylation in cancer may be largely independent of the transcriptional status of the affected gene. Most individually tested genes were also hypermethylated in primary blast cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, suggesting that our approach can identify novel potential disease markers.

Here, we show that the transcription factor TAL1 (also known as SCL) binds to the promoter of the NFKB1 gene that encodes p50 and represses its transcription to set up this unique response in T-ALL cells. When TAL1 expression is reduced in CEM T leukemia cells, basal NFKB1 expression is increased, and the levels of p65:cRel complex and transcription of its target gene, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), are reduced in response to etoposide treatment. Moreover, a significant negative correlation between NFKB1 and TAL1 or LMO1 was found in primary human TAL1/LMO1 double-positive T-ALL samples previously described by Ferrando et al.

Forodesine, a potent inhibitor of PNP, was designed based on the transition-state structure stabilized by the enzyme. Previous studies established that forodesine in the presence of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes. A phase 1 clinical trial of forodesine in T-cell malignancies demonstrated significant antileukemic activity with an increase in intracellular dGuo triphosphate (dGTP). High accumulation of dGTP in T cells may be dependent on the levels of deoxynucleoside kinases. Because B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells have high activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), we hypothesized that these lymphocytes would respond to forodesine. This postulate was tested in primary lymphocytes during in vitro investigations. Lymphocytes from 12 patients with CLL were incubated with forodesine and dGuo. These CLL cells showed a wide variation in the accumulation of intracellular dGTP without any effect on other deoxynucleotides. This was associated with DNA damage-induced p53 stabilization, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, and activation of p21. The dGTP accumulation was related to induction of apoptosis measured by caspase activation, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, and PARP cleavage. Based on these data, a phase 2 clinical trial of forodesine has been initiated for CLL patients.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Nimmanapalli R', 'Ravandi F', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 71, The University of Texas M.

Previously, we have shown that a methyl cytosine-binding complex binds to the methylated rho-globin gene in vitro. We have now chromatographically purified and characterized this complex from adult chicken primary erythroid cells. Four components of the MeCP1 transcriptional repression complex were identified: MBD2, RBAP48, HDAC2, and MTA1. These 4 proteins, as well as the zinc-finger protein p66 and the chromatin remodeling factor Mi2, were found to coelute by gel-filtration analysis and pull-down assays. We conclude that these 6 proteins are components of the MeCPC. In adult erythrocytes, significant enrichment for MBD2 is seen at the inactive rho-globin gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, whereas no enrichment is observed at the active beta(A)-globin gene, demonstrating MBD2 binds to the methylated and transcriptionally silent rho-globin gene in vivo. Knock-down of MBD2 resulted in up-regulation of a methylated rho-gene construct in mouse erythroleukemic (MEL)-rho cells.

Since donor lymphocyte infusions have clinical activity in JMML, T-cell-mediated immunotherapy could provide a nonredundant treatment approach to compliment current therapies. Gamma-globin, an oncofetal protein overexpressed by clonogenic JMML cells, may serve as a target of an antitumor immune response. We predicted 5 gamma-globin-derived peptides as potential human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes and showed that 4 (g031, g071, g105, and g106) bind A2 molecules in vitro. Using an artificial antigen-presenting cell (aAPC) that can process both the N- and C-termini of endogenously expressed proteins, we biochemically confirmed that g105 is naturally processed and presented by cell surface A2. Furthermore, g105-specific CD8(+) CTLs generated from A2-positive healthy donors were able to specifically cytolyze gamma-globin(+), but not gamma-globin(-) JMML cells in an A2-restricted manner.

HTLV-1 Tax protein plays a critical role in HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis and is an attractive target for vaccine development. Although HTLV-1 Tax is the most dominant antigen for HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) CTLs in HTLV-1-infected individuals, few epitopes recognized by CD4(+) helper T lymphocytes in HTLV-1 Tax protein have been described. The aim of the present study was to study T-helper-cell responses to HTLV-1 Tax and to identify naturally processed MHC class II-restricted epitopes that could be used for vaccine development. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An MHC class II binding peptide algorithm was used to predict potential T-helper cell epitope peptides from HTLV-1 Tax. We assessed the ability of the corresponding peptides to elicit helper T-cell responses by in vitro vaccination of purified CD4(+) T lymphocytes. RESULTS: Peptides Tax(191-205) and Tax(305-319) were effective in inducing T-helper-cell responses. Although Tax(191-205) was restricted by the HLA-DR1 and DR9 alleles, responses to Tax(305-319) were restricted by either DR15 or DQ9. Both these epitopes were found to be naturally processed by HTLV-1(+) T-cell lymphoma cells and by autologous antigen-presenting cells that were pulsed with HTLV-1 Tax(+) tumor lysates. Notably, the two newly identified helper T-cell epitopes are found to lie proximal to known CTL epitopes, which will facilitate the development of prophylactic peptide-based vaccine capable of inducing simultaneous CTL and T-helper responses.

G-CSF reduces the depth and duration of neutropenia in lymphoma patients and thus allows the design of more dose intense chemotherapy regimen which were shown to improve outcome particularly in patients with diffuse large B-cell and Hodgkin's lymphoma. G-CSF has been studied in patients with acute leukemias (ALL and AML) both concomitantly to induction chemotherapy to sensitize leukemic cells and after chemotherapy to reduce the duration of neutropenia and incidence of severe infection but it's benefit in these settings is still controversial. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can benefit from G-CSF in association with erythropoietin, particularly for patients with relative good prognosis according to the IPSS score at diagnosis. Still, an improvement of Quality of life needs to be demonstrated in the vue of the cost of these strategies. In aplastic anemia (AA), G-CSF has been used as a support during infection or in association with immunosuppressive treatments but caution is needed regarding the risk of clonal evolution in AA. The benefit of low dose G-CSF in chronic severe neutropenia is well established but the long term consequences of continuous G-CSF support are not known.

This prompted us to synthesize additional Gemini compounds with further modifications and evaluate their anticancer effects. Most effective in this series was 1,25-dihydroxy-20S-21(3-hydroxy-3-methyl-butyl)-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-vitamin D3 [Gemini-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-D3]. This analog was approximately 10-fold more potent than previously characterized Gemini compounds in inhibiting the clonal growth of HL-60, MCF-7 and LNCaP cell lines. Also in MCF-7 cells, Gemini-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-D3 caused dephosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase, Akt, resulting in dephosphorylation of the Akt target proteins, Forkhead transcription factor and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Downstream effectors of mTOR were also inhibited by the analog as demonstrated by decreased phosphorylation of both S6 kinase, and the translation inhibitor, 4E-BP1. The mTOR pathway regulates mRNA translation; exposure of MCF-7 cells to Gemini-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-D3 decreased their rate of protein synthesis and increased the association of 4EBP-1 with the translation initiation factor, eIF4E.

The envelope glycoprotein (GP) of filoviruses mediates viral entry into cells and is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and vaccine design. Here, we asked if the efficiency of virion incorporation of EBOV-GP impacts attachment and entry into target cells and modulates susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. In order to control the level of EBOV-GP expression, we generated cell lines expressing the GPs of the four known EBOV subspecies in an inducible fashion. Regulated expression of GP on the cell surface allowed production of reporter viruses harboring different amounts of GP. A pronounced reduction of virion incorporation of EBOV-GP had relatively little effect on virion infectivity, suggesting that only a few copies of GP might be sufficient for efficient engagement of cellular receptors. In contrast, optimal interactions with cellular attachment factors like the DC-SIGN protein required incorporation of high amounts of GP. Antibody-mediated neutralization of virions bearing high amounts of GP was slightly more efficient than neutralization of virions harboring low amounts of GP, suggesting that the efficiency of GP incorporation into virions might modulate susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. Finally, regulated expression of GP in permissive 293 cells did not reduce EBOV-GP-driven infection but diminished vesicular stomatitis virus GP (VSV-G) and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) GP mediated entry in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, intracellular GP does not seem to downmodulate expression of its receptor(s) but might alter expression and/or function of molecules involved in VSV-G and A-MLV-GP-dependent entry. Our results suggest that the efficiency of virion incorporation of GP could impact EBOV attachment to target cells and might modulate control of viral spread by the humoral immune response.","['Marzi, Andrea', 'Wegele, Anja', 'Pohlmann, Stefan']","['Marzi A', 'Wegele A', 'Pohlmann S']","['Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (envelope glycoprotein, Ebola virus)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ebolavirus/genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Virulence', 'Virus Assembly']",2006/06/17 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/06/17 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00298-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.04.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Sep 1;352(2):345-56. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.04.038.

Recently, alpha/beta+/CD8+ STCL has been recognized by the new World Health Organization (WHO)-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification of primary cutaneous lymphomas as a distinct entity in the group of CTCLs. OBSERVATIONS: We reviewed a series of 53 biopsies from 26 patients (F : M = 19:7; median age: 48; range 18-87) of cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas characterized by prominent involvement of the subcutaneous tissue. We could classify our cases according to the following seven categories--(i) STCL: n = 16; (ii) extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: n = 2; (iii) cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma: n = 2; (iv) anaplastic CD30+ large T-cell lymphoma: n = 1; (v) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, secondary cutaneous: n = 3; (vi) lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, secondary cutaneous: n = 1; (vii) specific cutaneous manifestations of myelogenous leukemia: n = 1. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the protean nature of lymphomas with prominent involvement of the subcutaneous fat tissues. The term STCL should be restricted to a homogeneous group of cases characterized morphologically by an exclusive involvement of subcutaneous tissues, immunohistochemically by a T-cytotoxic alpha/beta phenotype, and biologically by a relatively good prognosis.","['Massone, Cesare', 'Lozzi, Gian Piero', 'Egberts, Friederike', 'Fink-Puches, Regina', 'Cota, Carlo', 'Kerl, Helmut', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo']","['Massone C', 'Lozzi GP', 'Egberts F', 'Fink-Puches R', 'Cota C', 'Kerl H', 'Cerroni L']","['Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism/*pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Subcutaneous Tissue/metabolism/*pathology']",2006/06/17 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/17 09:00'],"['2006/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP493 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0303-6987.2006.00493.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2006 Jun;33(6):418-25. doi: 10.1111/j.0303-6987.2006.00493.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar, albeit less detailed, information is now available for other lymphoid organs, e.g., normal bone marrow, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus and spleen. Flow-cytometric immunophenotyping forms the basis of modern classification of acute and chronic leukemias and is increasingly applied for initial diagnostic work-up of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

Activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is present during rHuG-CSF treatment and is associated with endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation. We evaluated whether PMN activation by rHuG-CSF may alter the blood oxidative status and subsequently affect the vascular cell function. Fourteen healthy individuals received rHuG-CSF for HPC harvesting. Blood was drawn before starting rHuG-CSF (T0), on the last day of rHuG-CSF (T1) and 1 week after stopping rHuG-CSF (T2). Levels of CD11b, myeloperoxidase (MPO), hydroperoxides, nitric oxide (NO), and soluble endothelium (sES), leukocyte (sLS), and platelet (sPS) selectins were measured. During rHuG-CSF, CD11b, MPO and hydroperoxides significantly increased, while NO levels significantly decreased, compared with T0. At T2 all these markers returned to baseline values. Significant increments of all selectins were observed during rHuG-CSF. At T2 sES and sEP significantly decreased back to pre-treatment values, whereas sLS remained significantly high. These data show that rHuG-CSF induces a transient inflammatory status characterized by circulating activated PMN, which release reactive oxygen species and intracellular proteases, promoting the onset of an abnormal oxidative status. This process may modify the hemostatic balance towards a pro-thrombotic state.","['Cella, G', 'Marchetti, M', 'Vignoli, A', 'Randi, M L', 'Saggiorato, G', 'Pasetto, L', 'Pagnan, A', 'Barbui, T', 'Falanga, A']","['Cella G', 'Marchetti M', 'Vignoli A', 'Randi ML', 'Saggiorato G', 'Pasetto L', 'Pagnan A', 'Barbui T', 'Falanga A']","['Department of Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche, Universita degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Selectins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'CD11b Antigen/blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophil Activation/*drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/blood', 'Peroxidase/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Selectins/*blood', 'Thrombosis/*etiology']",2006/06/16 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404271 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404271 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1430-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404271.

To reexamine the recombination rates for MLV, experiments were performed to control for nonrandom copackaging of viral RNA, and it was found that MLV and HIV-1 exhibit similar crossover rates.

We now demonstrate that the L2 protein is able to interact with the microtubule network via the motor protein dynein. L2 protein was found attached to microtubules after uncoating of incoming human papillomavirus pseudovirions. Based on immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, the L2 region interacting with dynein is mapped to the C-terminal 40 amino acids. Mutations within this region abrogating the L2/dynein interaction strongly reduce the infectivity of pseudoviruses, indicating that this interaction mediates the minus-end-directed transport of the viral genome along microtubules towards the nucleus.","['Florin, Luise', 'Becker, Katrin A', 'Lambert, Carsten', 'Nowak, Thorsten', 'Sapp, Cornelia', 'Strand, Dennis', 'Streeck, Rolf E', 'Sapp, Martin']","['Florin L', 'Becker KA', 'Lambert C', 'Nowak T', 'Sapp C', 'Strand D', 'Streeck RE', 'Sapp M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 1501 Kings Highway, Shreveport, LA 71130-3932, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (L2 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (oncogene viral capsid protein L2, human papillomavirus type 33)', 'EC 3.6.4.2 (Dyneins)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Dyneins/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Space/*metabolism/virology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/metabolism/virology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Papillomaviridae/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",2006/06/16 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/13/6691 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00057-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(13):6691-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00057-06.,,,,,PMC1488977,,,,,,,,,

Tax is also diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and affects the functions of cytoplasmic cellular proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the distribution of Tax between the cytoplasm and nucleus remain to be identified. Since Tax has been shown to promote genome instability by perturbing cell cycle progression and DNA repair mechanisms following DNA damage, we examined the effect of genotoxic stress on the subcellular distribution and interacting partners of Tax. Tax localization was altered in response to various forms of cellular stress, resulting in an increase in cytoplasmic Tax and a decrease in Tax speckled structures. Concomitantly, colocalization of Tax with sc35 (a TSS protein) decreased following stress. Tax translocation required the CRM1 nuclear export pathway, and a transient interaction between Tax and CRM1 was observed following stress. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution of Tax and the interactions between Tax and cellular proteins respond dynamically to cellular stress. Changes in Tax distribution and interacting partners are likely to affect cellular processes that regulate cellular transformation.","['Gatza, Michael L', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Gatza ML', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza MS-385, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA077371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/virology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Space/metabolism/virology', 'Karyopherins/*metabolism', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2006/06/16 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/13/6657 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02270-05 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(13):6657-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02270-05.,,,,,PMC1488944,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that the replications of genomic- and antigenomic-strand HDV RNAs have different sensitivities to alpha-amanitin, suggesting that these two strands are synthesized in different transcription machineries in the cells, but the nature of these transcription machineries is not clear. In this study, we performed metabolic labeling and immunofluorescence staining of newly synthesized HDV RNA with bromouridine after HDV RNA transfection into hepatocytes and confirmed that HDV RNA synthesis had both alpha-amanitin-sensitive and -resistant components. The antigenomic RNA labeling was alpha-amanitin resistant and localized to the nucleolus. The genomic RNA labeling was alpha-amanitin sensitive and more diffusely localized in the nucleoplasm. Most of the genomic RNA labeling appeared to colocalize with the PML nuclear bodies. Furthermore, promyelocytic leukemia protein, RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and the Pol I-associated transcription factor SL1 could be precipitated together with hepatitis delta antigen, suggesting the association of HDV replication complex with the Pol I and Pol II transcription machineries. This conclusion was further confirmed by an in vitro replication assay. These findings provide additional evidence that HDV RNA synthesis occurs in the Pol I and Pol II transcription machineries, thus extending the capability of the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to utilizing RNA as templates.","['Li, Yi-Jia', 'Macnaughton, Thomas', 'Gao, Lu', 'Lai, Michael M C']","['Li YJ', 'Macnaughton T', 'Gao L', 'Lai MM']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 2011 Zonal Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90033-1054, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (Hepatitis delta Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (TAF1B protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Amanitins/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hepatitis Delta Virus/*physiology', 'Hepatitis delta Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intranuclear Space/*metabolism/virology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/*physiology']",2006/06/16 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/13/6478 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02650-05 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Jul;80(13):6478-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02650-05.,,,,,PMC1488965,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting.

Discovery of molecular markers that better define NHL should improve diagnosis, prognosis and understanding of the biology. We developed a CpG island DNA microarray for discovery of aberrant methylation targets in cancer, and now apply this method to examine NHL cell lines and primary tumors. This methylation profiling revealed differential patterns in six cell lines originating from different subtypes of NHL. We identified 30 hypermethylated genes in these cell lines and independently confirmed 10 of them. Methylation of 6 of these genes was then further examined in 75 primary NHL specimens composed of four subtypes representing different stages of maturation. Each gene (DLC-1, PCDHGB7, CYP27B1, EFNA5, CCND1 and RARbeta2) was frequently hypermethylated in these NHLs (87, 78, 61, 53, 40 and 38%, respectively), but not in benign follicular hyperplasia. Although some genes such as DLC-1 and PCDHGB7 were methylated in the vast majority of NHLs, others were differentially methylated in specific subtypes. The methylation of the candidate tumor suppressor gene DLC-1 was detected in a high proportion of primary tumor and plasma DNA samples by using quantitative methylation-specific PCR analysis. This promoter hypermethylation inversely correlated with DLC-1 gene expression in primary NHL samples. Thus, this CpG island microarray is a powerful discovery tool to identify novel methylated genes for further studies of their relevant molecular pathways in NHLs and identification of potential epigenetic biomarkers of disease.","['Shi, Huidong', 'Guo, Juyuan', 'Duff, Deiter J', 'Rahmatpanah, Farahnaz', 'Chitima-Matsiga, Rebecca', 'Al-Kuhlani, Mufadhal', 'Taylor, Kristen H', 'Sjahputera, Ozy', 'Andreski, Melinda', 'Wooldridge, James E', 'Caldwell, Charles W']","['Shi H', 'Guo J', 'Duff DJ', 'Rahmatpanah F', 'Chitima-Matsiga R', 'Al-Kuhlani M', 'Taylor KH', 'Sjahputera O', 'Andreski M', 'Wooldridge JE', 'Caldwell CW']","['Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO 65203, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA097880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DLC1 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2006/06/16 09:00,2007/02/09 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgl092 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgl092 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2007 Jan;28(1):60-70. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgl092.

Bronchoscopy is generally to be used as a diagnostic tool in order to find a causative pathogen. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective study the combination of protected specimen brush (PSB) and protected bronchoalveolar lavage (PBAL) was compared with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for evaluated feasibility and diagnostic yield in granulocytopenic patients with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: All specimens from 63 bronchoscopic procedures (35 BAL and 28 PSB-PBAL) were investigated by cytological examination and various microbiological tests. If clinically relevant and feasible, based on the clinical condition and/or the presence of thrombocytopenia, lung tissue samples were obtained. RESULTS: The majority of the 58 included patients were diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukaemia and developed a severe neutropenia (BAL-group: 27 days; PSB-PBAL group: 30 days). Microbiological and cytological examination of 63 bronchoscopic procedures (35 BAL and 28 PSB-PBAL) yielded causative pathogens in 9 (26%) patients of the BAL-group and 8 (29%) patients of the PSB-PBAL group (PSB and PBAL 4 each). Aspergillus fumigatus was the pathogen most frequently (13%) detected. Using all available examinations including the results of autopsy, a presumptive diagnosis was established in 43% of the patients in the BAL group and 57% of those in the PSB-PBAL group; in these cases microbial aetiology was correctly identified in 67% and 57%, respectively. The complication rate was of these procedures were low, and none of the patients experienced serious complications due to the invasive techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that modern bronchoscopic techniques such as PSB and PBAL did not yield better diagnostic results compared to BAL in granulocytopenic patients with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates.

To investigate gp130 dimerization, we performed co-precipitation experiments with the endogenous cytokine receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) and with gp130 variants carrying two different C-terminal peptide tags. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was employed to detect dimerization of two fluorescent-tagged gp130 variants. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used for FRET detection in live cells. gp130 and LIF-R could be coprecipitated in the absence of ligand. The interaction, however, was intensified by the addition of LIF. Similar results were obtained with the gp130 variants and confirmed by FRET analysis in live cells. The present study clearly demonstrates the existence of preformed but inactive gp130/LIF-R hetero- and gp130/gp130 homo-dimers.

Most patients (26; 93%) had haematological malignancies (19 had leukaemia); half (14) were allogeneic stem-cell transplant recipients. Twelve patients (43%) had severe neutropenia (< or = 100/mm3) with a mean duration of 65 days (range 10-500 days), and ten (36%) patients had received a significant dose of corticosteroids. Most (19; 68%) FOAIs were caused by contiguous extension, while nine (32%) were associated with haematogenous spread. Pain, joint instability and local drainage were seen in 28 (100%), six (21%), and seven (25%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (57%) patients had symptoms for < 1 month. The sinuses (ten; 36%) and the vertebral spine (six; 21%) were the most common sites involved. Moulds were the predominant pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus (two); non-fumigatus Aspergillus spp. (eight); non-specified Aspergillus spp. (three); Fusarium spp. (six); Zygomycetes (five); Scedosporium apiospermum (two); and Exserohilum sp. (one). Candida was the causative pathogen in four cases (including two cases of mixed FOAIs). Arthritis and post-operative FOAIs were both uncommon manifestations, occurring in two patients each. All patients received systemic antifungal therapy (combinations in 20 cases), and 19 cases underwent adjunctive surgery. The crude mortality rates (at 12 weeks) were 44% (9/20) in the patients who underwent surgery and antifungal therapy vs. 33% (2/6) in patients who received antifungal therapy alone (p not significant). FOAI is a rare, yet severe, manifestation of localised or systemic mycoses, caused predominantly by moulds, and is seen typically in patients with haematological malignancies.","['Kumashi, P R', 'Safdar, A', 'Chamilos, G', 'Chemaly, R F', 'Raad, I I', 'Kontoyiannis, D P']","['Kumashi PR', 'Safdar A', 'Chamilos G', 'Chemaly RF', 'Raad II', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

Numerous systemic diseases have been associated with urticarial vasculitis, including certain hematologic disorders. This distinctive form of cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis can be resistant to standard therapeutic modalities, necessitating more aggressive intervention. METHODS: We report a case of refractory urticarial vasculitis developing in association with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a 46-year-old man. We also reviewed the literature to identify other cases of urticarial vasculitis managed with this therapeutic modality. RESULTS: The disease progressively improved during 6 treatments with plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). In the additional cases identified in the literature, plasmapheresis was generally effective and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, we propose that plasmapheresis be considered a treatment option for refractory urticarial vasculitis.","['Alexander, Jessica L', 'Kalaaji, Amer N', 'Shehan, James M', 'Yokel, Benjamin K', 'Pittelkow, Mark R']","['Alexander JL', 'Kalaaji AN', 'Shehan JM', 'Yokel BK', 'Pittelkow MR']","['Mayo Medical School, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Drugs Dermatol,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,101160020,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Plasmapheresis', 'Vasculitis/complications/pathology/*therapy']",2006/06/16 09:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2006/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Drugs Dermatol. 2006 Jun;5(6):534-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may be even considered as alternative drugs to corticosteroids in reducing cerebral peritumoural oedema. An important focus for drugs acting in the central nervous system is achieving a high extent of brain penetration. Today there is increasing evidence for the importance of transporters, especially P-glycoprotein (Pgp), for drug disposition and resulting clinical response. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the concentrations of the potent keto derivatives, the 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (KBA) and the acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), in proportion to boswellic acids lacking a keto group, like the beta-boswellic acid, are much lower in plasma than in the orally administered extract. Moreover the brain/plasma ratio for KBA and AKBA determined in preliminary experiments on rats was only about 0.51 and 0.81, respectively, in spite of their lipophilicity. Until now little is known about the cerebral pharmacokinetics of boswellic acids and how it may be influenced. Since many drugs are known to interact with Pgp at the level of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier the modulatory potencies of the Boswellia serrata extract of H15(R) and the major boswellic acids on the transport activity of Pgp have been determined in two in vitro assays. A human lymphocytic leukaemia cell line (VLB cells) expressing Pgp was chosen as model for human Pgp, and porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC cells) were taken as model for the blood-brain barrier using calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) as Pgp substrate. It was found that the Boswellia extract, as well as the keto-boswellic acids inhibit the transport activity of Pgp in the micromolecular range in both cell types. No modulation was observed using those boswellic acids which have no keto group in their structure. The inhibition of Pgp at the blood-brain barrier by Boswellia extract is probably not relevant for the brain availability of other Pgp substrates, because of the low plasma levels determined for KBA and AKBA. However the presented data could not exclude the possibility of drug interactions caused by modulation of Pgp by extracts of Boswellia serrata on the gastrointestinal level.","['Weber, Claudia-Carolin', 'Reising, Karen', 'Muller, Walter E', 'Schubert-Zsilavecz, Manfred', 'Abdel-Tawab, Mona']","['Weber CC', 'Reising K', 'Muller WE', 'Schubert-Zsilavecz M', 'Abdel-Tawab M']","['Institute of Pharmacology, ZAFES, Biocenter, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '631-69-6 (boswellic acid)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', '*Boswellia', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/blood/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Swine', 'Triterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/07/25 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2006-931536 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2006 May;72(6):507-13. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-931536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied IL-6 in breast cancer cell lines and have shown that autocrine production of IL-6 can confer multi-drug resistance in vitro by inducing multidrug resistance gene-1 transcription with subsequent overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP). Both IL-6 and PGP expression can be measured in malignant cells using immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. We hypothesized that patients whose tumors expressed higher amounts of IL-6 or PGP would be less likely to respond to paclitaxel, an agent affected by the PGP pathway. If so, then IL-6 could serve as a predictive factor for paclitaxel sensitivity. Both IL-6 and PGP expression were measured in patients treated in a randomized trial that compared three doses of single agent paclitaxel (175, 210, and 250 mg/m(2) over 3 h every 3 weeks) in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer (CALGB 9342). No difference in complete and partial response was found among the three treatment arms. Tissue blocks in this trial were analyzed for IL-6 (154 patients) and PGP (149 patients) in paraffin-embedded sections from tumor samples; clinical characteristics of these patients were similar to the total sample of 469 patients. There were no significant differences among IL-6 or PGP scores whether measured as continuous or dichotomous variables, or by other scoring, and response to paclitaxel. In multivariate analysis neither IL-6 nor PGP was a significant predictor of time to progression or overall survival.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 43 B-CLL patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HVs) were examined by conventional and quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA of RHAMM/CD168, fibromodulin, syntaxin and NY-Ren60 was expressed in 55-90%, and mRNA of HSJ2, MAZ and OFAiLRP was expressed in 90-100% of the patients. No expression of WT-1, hTERT, BAGE, G250, MAGE1 or survivin was observed. Low (2-20%) expression frequencies of MPP11, PINCH, PRAME and proteinase were detected. RHAMM/CD168, fibromodulin, PRAME and MPP11 showed expression in B-CLL patients, but not in HVs. Because of the exquisite tissue expression of RHAMM/CD168 and its high expression frequency in CLL patients, mixed lymphocyte peptide culture (MLPC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and flow cytometry were performed for antigen specific T-cells. In MLPC, RHAMM specific responses by CD8+HLA-A2/R3tetramer+CCR7-CD45RAhigh effector T-cells were detected.

Consequently, these patients also evidence individually different clinical courses when administered with anti-leukemia drugs. In order to find new, more precise molecular markers for leukemia classification, we have analyzed the gene expression profiles from 65 diagnostic bone marrow specimens of adult patients with AML, ALL, CML or CLL by using high-throughput DNA microarrays harboring approximately 8,300 unique human genes or expression sequence tags. In the present study, we identified a group of leukemia-specific genes, which manifest gene expression profiles distinctly representative of normal bone marrow samples, as determined by a significance analysis of microarray (SAM) and GeneSpring 6.1 programs. We also determined the minimal number of genes showing a difference between acute and chronic leukemia patient groups. Furthermore, the unsupervised cluster analysis revealed a gene subset which can be used to distinguish between AML, ALL, CML and CLL patient groups, based on expression signatures. The expression levels of differentially regulated genes were verified via the principle component analysis (PCA). Our results may provide a novel set of molecular criteria for the classification of leukemia patients, and may also facilitate effects to discovery new targets, allowing for more effective treatment of leukemia patients.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Lee, Chang Hyun', 'Kim, Seung Jun', 'Hwang, Seung Yong', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee CH', 'Kim SJ', 'Hwang SY', 'Kim TS']","['College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2006/06/15 09:00,2007/08/04 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Jul;29(1):57-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are reports of groups with high prevalences of HTLV-1 infection in Peru, but there is limited knowledge of the epidemiology of infection or which routes of infection are most important. We studied 2,492 women presenting to a large maternity hospital in Lima for prenatal, delivery, or abortion services. HTLV-1 seropositivity was confirmed in 42 women (1.7%; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.2). Seroprevalence increased with age but did not vary by region of birth or recency of migration to Lima. Age greater than 30 years and sexual intercourse before 20 years of age were strongly and independently associated with infection. History of abortion and history of transfusion were of borderline significance. Women whose male partner had a characteristic that might be a marker for risk of sexually transmitted infections were also more likely to be infected. HTLV-1 is common among Peruvians throughout the country and is maintained by a low level of neonatally acquired infection that is amplified by sexual transmission. In addition to screening of the blood supply, instituted in 1997, programs designed to reduce neonatal and sexual transmission should be effective.","['Alarcon, Jorge O', 'Friedman, Heidi B', 'Montano, Silvia M', 'Zunt, Joseph R', 'Holmes, King K', 'Quinnan, Gerald V Jr']","['Alarcon JO', 'Friedman HB', 'Montano SM', 'Zunt JR', 'Holmes KK', 'Quinnan GV Jr']","['Facultad de Medicina/Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru.']",,['eng'],"['K01 TW000007/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI031448/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R03TW00679/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS055627/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'TW00007/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW000007/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 AI001600/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-31448/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-27757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 AI001600-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23AI00160/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,,IM,"['Abortion, Induced', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'Geography', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Peru/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Partners']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/08/30 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.qai.0000221680.52563.d5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2006 Aug 15;42(5):604-9. doi: 10.1097/01.qai.0000221680.52563.d5.,,,,,PMC2683844,,,,['NIHMS109759'],,,,,

Recently, we found that human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells and human peripheral blood eosinophils express the CB2 receptor. We also found that 2-AG induces the migration of these cells in a CB2 receptor-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated whether the 2-AG-induced migration of human eosinophils is due to chemotaxis or chemokinesis. We also compared the ability of 2-AG to induce the migration of eosinophils with those of other eosinophil chemoattractants. METHODS: Eosinophils were separated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. The migration of eosinophils to various stimulants was examined using Transwell inserts. In view of the fact that 2-AG is rapidly metabolized by cells, we employed 2-AG ether, an ether-linked nonhydrolyzable analog of 2-AG, instead of 2-AG to determine whether the 2-AG-induced migration is due to chemotaxis or chemokinesis. RESULTS: 2-AG ether induced the migration of human eosinophils, like 2-AG. The 2-AG ether-induced migration was reduced by the coincubation of eosinophils with 2-AG ether in the upper compartment of the Transwell inserts, indicating that the migration is attributable to chemotaxis. The concentration of 2-AG required to induce the eosinophil migration appears to be pathophysiologically relevant, although the order of the pharmacologically effective concentration of 2-AG was approximately ten times lower than those of platelet-activating factor, RANTES and eotaxin. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that 2-AG is involved in the infiltration of eosinophils during allergic inflammation.","['Kishimoto, Seishi', 'Oka, Saori', 'Gokoh, Maiko', 'Sugiura, Takayuki']","['Kishimoto S', 'Oka S', 'Gokoh M', 'Sugiura T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (CCL11 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors, Eosinophil)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokine CCL5/pharmacology', 'Chemokines, CC/pharmacology', 'Chemotactic Factors, Eosinophil/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/immunology/metabolism']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['92704 [pii]', '10.1159/000092704 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2006;140 Suppl 1:3-7. doi: 10.1159/000092704.,,,"['Copyright 2006 S.

Truncation mutations of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) are associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia in patients with severe congenital neutropenia. Although increased proliferative signaling by a representative G-CSFR truncation mutation (termed d715) has been documented, the molecular basis for this hyperproliferative phenotype has not been fully characterized. Given the accumulating evidence implicating Src family kinases in the transduction of cytokine receptor signals, the role of these kinases in the regulation of G-CSF signaling was examined. We show that Hck and Lyn, Src family kinases expressed in myeloid cells, are negative regulators of granulopoiesis that act at distinct stages of granulocytic differentiation. Whereas Hck regulates the G-CSF-induced proliferation of granulocytic precursors, Lyn regulates the production of myeloid progenitors. Interestingly, d715 G-CSFR myeloid progenitors were resistant to the growth-stimulating effect of treatment with a Src kinase inhibitor. Together, these data establish Lyn and Hck as key negative regulators of granulopoiesis and raise the possibility that loss of Src family kinase activation by the d715 G-CSFR may contribute to its hyperproliferative phenotype.","['Mermel, Craig H', 'McLemore, Morgan L', 'Liu, Fulu', 'Pereira, Shalini', 'Woloszynek, Jill', 'Lowell, Clifford A', 'Link, Daniel C']","['Mermel CH', 'McLemore ML', 'Liu F', 'Pereira S', 'Woloszynek J', 'Lowell CA', 'Link DC']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S Euclid Ave, Campus Box 8007, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,['eng'],"['K08 HL 004546-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 10193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Hck protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/deficiency/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/11/03 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52438-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-024307 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 15;108(8):2562-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-024307.

Surprisingly, in 17 patients (36.2%) (4 at diagnosis, 11 during chronic phase, and 2 in accelerated phase), we found several unique secondary chromosome abnormalities including trisomy 13, partial trisomy 13, and abnormalities of 1p, 3p, 6p, 7p, 10p, and 11p, which are different from the so-called additional chromosome abnormalities (extra Ph, +8, i(17q), +19, and +21) observed in blastic phase CML. FISH analysis revealed the Ph translocation with der(9) deletion in 11 patients (23.4%). Of these, 2 had two clones, with and without der(9) deletion, suggesting that der(9) deletion would occur in a subset of patients during disease progression.

While characterizing an LFS family with a documented defect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. Her mother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a soft tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization of a primary skin fibroblast cell line revealed that the patient had a novel balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 15: t(11;15)(q23;q15).

Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR) are rather rare, and the significance and frequency of different anomalies are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the chromosomes and chromosomal regions which are involved in CCR during progression of the disease and the frequency of nonrandom changes. Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and multicolor FISH (mFISH) were used to study karyotypes of 18 CML patients with CCR ascertained by G-banding. Most often involved in CCR were chromosomes 2 (x6); 3, 7, and 17 (x5); 1 and 4 (x4); and 5, 6, 11, and 12 (x3); regions 1q, 2q, 5q, 7p, and 17p; and breakpoints 17p11.2 (x3) and 7p15 (x2).

We have explored the augmentive effect of rituximab on the anti-CD19 immunotoxin BU12-SAPORIN in a model of human lymphoma. Intact rituximab and its F(ab)2 derivative both augmented the immunospecific protein synthesis inhibitory effects of BU12-SAPORIN in a complement-independent manner. A combination of rituximab + BU12-SAPORIN completely abolished the proliferation of Ramos cells in vitro and also induced a significantly greater degree of apoptosis in these cells. Treatment with rituximab, BU12-SAPORIN or a combination of both induced poly(ADPribose) polymerase and caspase 3 cleavage, although this was always consistently greater in combination-treated cells. zVAD almost completely inhibited apoptosis in rituximab- or BU12-SAPORIN-treated cells but only partially in combination-treated cells. In severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-Ramos mice the combination of rituximab + BU12-SAPORIN was significantly better therapeutically than either single agent. The immunological fidelity of the therapeutic effect because of combination treatment was demonstrated through the failure of rituximab to augment an irrelevant anti-CD7 immunotoxin. The therapeutic efficacy of rituximab and combination treatment was reduced in SCID-Ramos mice depleted of serum complement while natural killer cell depletion failed to show any convincing role for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This study shows a clear therapeutic advantage from using rituximab to immunospecifically augment immunotoxin cytotoxicity warranting further investigation.","['Flavell, David J', 'Warnes, Sarah L', 'Bryson, Christine J', 'Field, Sarah A', 'Noss, Armorel L', 'Packham, Graham', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Warnes SL', 'Bryson CJ', 'Field SA', 'Noss AL', 'Packham G', 'Flavell SU']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Unit and Cancer Research UK, Division of Cancer Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, University of Southampton Medical School, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, Hampshire, UK. d.j.flavell@soton.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD55 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD59 Antigens/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Plant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Rituximab', 'Saporins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6155 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06155.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Jul;134(2):157-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06155.x.

Serial studies using chimeric viruses derived from the A8-V and the 57 virus (57-V), which is a non-neuropathogenic strain of Friend murine leukemia virus, proved that the long terminal repeat (LTR) and 5' leader (LTR-leader/A8) derived from A8-V, in addition to the env gene (env/A8) of A8-V, are necessary for the neuropathogenesis of A8-V. The enhancer element within the LTR of A8-V (LTR/A8) has been supposed to contribute to the severe manifestation of spongiosis by inducing high levels of viral production in the brain after A8-V infection. However, the recombinant viruses R7c and R7f, which lack the enhancer element of A8-V, induced spongiosis with high incidence rates, although the isolated viral titers of the infected brain display very low levels, which are even comparable to the 57-V infection. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that infection with neuropathogenic chimerae, R7c and R7f, induced increased expression of viral antigens than that produced by infection with non-neuropathogenic chimeric virus, Rec5, despite the fact that R7c, R7f and Rec5 all exhibited similar levels of viral proliferation in the brain postinfection. Thus, neuropathology induced by A8 infection is not dependent upon the viral proliferation rate but rather the level of viral antigen expression.","['Watanabe, Rihito', 'Takase-Yoden, Sayaka']","['Watanabe R', 'Takase-Yoden S']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Tangi-cho 1-236, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan. rihito@t.soka.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Neuropathology,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,9606526,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Brain Diseases/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Clone Cells', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neuroglia/virology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism/*pathology']",2006/06/15 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00680.x [doi]'],ppublish,Neuropathology. 2006 Jun;26(3):188-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00680.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of cell death triggered by NBDHEX has been deeply investigated in leukemia cell lines. Kinetic data indicate a similar NBDHEX membrane permeability between multidrug resistance cells and their sensitive counterpart revealing that NBDHEX is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein export pump. Unexpectedly, this molecule promotes a caspase-dependent apoptosis that is unusual in the P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cells. The primary event of the apoptotic pathway is the dissociation of glutathione S-transferase P1-1 from the complex with c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Interestingly, leukemia MDR1-expressing cells show lower LC50 values and a higher degree of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity than their drug-sensitive counterparts. The increased susceptibility of the multidrug resistance cells toward the NBDHEX action may be related to a lower content of glutathione S-transferase P1-1.

It was hypothesized that their expression patterns might yield information on apoptosis as it occurs in normal and reactive lymphoid cells, and also be of value for the detection of lymphoma subtypes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Both molecules were studied in paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cell lines by immunoperoxidase staining, and were also studied by western blotting. Human tonsillar B-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry for LCK expression. RESULTS: LCK was detected for the first time in germinal centers and, at lower levels, in mantle zone B cells. The presence of LCK in B cells was confirmed by western blotting. Cross-linking surface IgM reduced LCK expression whereas cross-linking surface CD40 appeared to have the opposite effect. BAFF-R was present on mantle zone B cells but absent or weakly expressed in germinal center cells. Most lymphomas of germinal center origin (e.g. follicular lymphoma) and also many mantle cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and most T-cell neoplasms expressed LCK. In contrast, BAFF-R was expressed in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, but often absent in grade 3 follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Both LCK-positive and BAFF-R-positive DLBCL tended to be of germinal-center phenotype. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The reciprocal expression pattern of LCK and BAFF-R in germinal center and mantle zone B cells may reflect their opposing roles in apoptosis. Their detection in lymphoma tissue biopsies may therefore be of clinical relevance in predicting response to treatment.","['Paterson, Jennifer C', 'Tedoldi, Sara', 'Craxton, Andrew', 'Jones, Margaret', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Collins, Graham', 'Roberton, Helen', 'Natkunam, Yasodha', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Campo, Elias', 'Clark, Edward A', 'Mason, David Y', 'Marafioti, Teresa']","['Paterson JC', 'Tedoldi S', 'Craxton A', 'Jones M', 'Hansmann ML', 'Collins G', 'Roberton H', 'Natkunam Y', 'Pileri S', 'Campo E', 'Clark EA', 'Mason DY', 'Marafioti T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",,['eng'],['GM37905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/06/14 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/06/14 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):772-80.,,,,['Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):725A.

The role of this fusion gene during leukemogenesis is not yet fully understood; one approach to investigate its function is to selectively deplete the E2A-PBX1 protein and examine the consequences. DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the efficacy of anti-E2A-PBX1 siRNA in the 697 pre-B leukemia cell line. Transfection was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and FACS, while E2A-PBX1 mRNA expression was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The reduction of the level of the corresponding fusion protein was assessed by western blot analysis and the expression of putative downstream target genes was detected by SYBR Green PCR. RESULTS: We demonstrated efficient downregulation induced by anti-E2A-PBX1 siRNA in 697 t(1;19)-positive leukemia cells. In particular, E2A-PBX1 silencing affected the EB-1 gene, which encodes for a protein that could contribute to the transformed phenotype of pre-B ALL. The detected EB-1 expression was reduced to 25% of the normal expression level in non-transfected 697 cells. Furthermore, the significant decrease in Wnt16b mRNA levels (but not of the Wnt16a isoform of the Wnt16 gene), observed following depletion of the fusion gene, confirms the hypothesis that Wnt16b is a target of E2A-PBX1. The siRNA inhibition was followed by an increase in apoptosis and similar results were obtained in two other ALL cell lines, one with and one without the t(1;19) translocation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Targeted-E2A-PBX1 inhibition leads to reduced expression of the EB-1 and Wnt16b genes; aberrant expression of these genes may be a key step in leukemogenesis in t(1;19)-positive pre-B leukemia.","['Casagrande, Giovanna', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Casagrande G', 'te Kronnie G', 'Basso G']","['Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MAPRE1 protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT16 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics']",2006/06/14 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/06/14 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):765-71.,,,,['Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):724.

To test new targeted therapeutics, it is critical to develop sensitive analytical tools to detect abnormal activation of these pathways and to monitor their inhibition in response to treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed Akt and ERK phosphorylation in 32 samples from patients using western blot and a two-color flow cytometry protocol using CD34. To circumvent the CD34 negative AML found in our series, we developed a two-color protocol using CD45 to isolate the blast cell population. Finally, a four-color protocol was used to detect phosphorylation in an enriched population of AML stem cells. RESULTS: We compared western blot analysis and flow cytometry for the detection of PI3K/Akt and ERK activation and found a 100% correlation between the two techniques in a series of 32 AML samples. Using a flow cytometry protocol, we were able to analyze all the patients' samples, even those with low blast infiltration or CD34 negative blast cells. We were also able to detect the phosphorylated proteins in the most immature blast cell population with the CD34+ CD38-/low CD123+ phenotype. Interpretations and CONCLUSION: Our study shows that flow cytometry is a reliable method for detecting Akt and ERK phosphorylation in all patients' samples. Activation can also be detected in the most immature blast cells, which represent exquisite target cells for new therapeutics.","['Bardet, Valerie', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Lacombe, Catherine']","['Bardet V', 'Tamburini J', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D', 'Lacombe C']","['Universite Paris-Descartes, Faculte de Medecine, Institut Cochin (INSERM U567, CNRS-UMR 8104), Paris, France. valerie.bardet@cch.aphp.fr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*blood', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*blood']",2006/06/14 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/06/14 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):757-64.,,,,['Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):723B.

Peripheral blood (PB) HSCT was introduced in 1992 and PB has become the source of choice of autologous stem cells worldwide. Autologous PB stem cells result in faster hematopoietic recovery, but may be associated with a higher risk of relapse. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of 336 patients transplanted after 1992 with either bone marrow (BM) (n=104) or PB (n=232). RESULTS: Various factors had an impact on event-free survival in univariate analysis: age hazard ratio [HR]=1.1 per 10 years; p=0.12), source of stem cells (HR=1.2, p=0.22), interval between diagnosis and transplantation (HR=1.0 per month; p=0.87), and therapy-related vs primary disease (HR=0.5; p=0.002). In the multivariate Cox model, the event-free survival was not different after PB or BM HSCT with a HR of 0.93 (95% confidence interval of 0.67 - 1.30; p=0.67). The relapse risk after transplantation with stem cells from either source was similar with a HR of 1.1. A significant interaction (p=0.02) between age and the source of stem cells indicated a more favorable potential of autologous PB HSCT in young age groups. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Autologous PB and BM HSCT result in equivalent outcomes. Therefore, given the more rapid hematopoietic recovery PB is the preferred source of stem cells.","['de Witte, Theo', 'Brand, Ronald', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Delforge, Michel', 'Biersack, Harold', 'Or, Reuven', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Bandini, Beppe', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['de Witte T', 'Brand R', 'van Biezen A', 'Delforge M', 'Biersack H', 'Or R', 'Meloni G', 'Bandini B', 'Sierra J', 'Kroger N', 'Gratwohl A', 'Niederwieser D']","['Dept. of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['MDS subcommittee of the EBMT Chronic Leukemia Working Party'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/06/14 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/06/14 09:00'],"['2006/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):750-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL marrow cell populations -enriched for hematopoietic progenitors by means of a negative selection procedure- were assessed for their proliferation and expansion potentials, in liquid cultures supplemented with a mixture of early- and late-acting recombinant stimulatory cytokines, throughout a 25-day culture period. ALL cells, although capable of responding to the stimulatory signals provided by hematopoietic stimulators, showed deficient proliferation potentials (reduced capacity to generate more nucleated cells), as compared with their normal counterparts. The capacity to generate myeloid and erythroid progenitors was also significantly reduced in ALL cultures. Interestingly, the functional alterations observed in ALL cultures (i.e., deficient proliferation and expansion potentials) were more pronounced in those from Ph+ patients than in those from Ph- patients. This study indicates that bone marrow cell populations - enriched for hematopoietic progenitor cells - from ALL patients possess deficient proliferation and expansion potentials in vitro, and that such functional alterations are more severe when cells are derived from Ph+ patients, as compared to their Ph- counterparts.","['Martinez-Jaramillo, Guadalupe', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Sanchez-Valle, Elizabeth', 'Montesinos, Juan Jose', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Martinez-Jaramillo G', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Montesinos JJ', 'Mayani H']","['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Siglo XXI National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/genetics/pathology']",2006/06/14 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/06/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00158-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Jan;31(1):83-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.05.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to the ATP-binding site of the target kinase and prevents the transfer of phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues of various substrates. At oral doses of 200-600 mg, the majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing the BCR-ABL fusion protein and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) achieve a bio-molecular and clinical response, frequently complete, associated with limited toxicity. Several other human cancers, as small-cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, seminoma, some sarcomas, and adenoid cystic carcinomas may over-express KIT or PDGF-R, and clinical trials to evaluate the role of IM in the treatment of such cancers are currently ongoing. We determined c-KIT with Dako CD 117 antibody in 5 cases of advanced ocular melanoma (OM) and we found positive immuno-reactivity for CD 117 in three patients. We treated all patients with palliative-use IM at the oral dose of 400 mgr daily. We obtained in expressing positive immuno-reactivity for CD 117 patients: a reduction of malignant ascites in one, a partial remission in the neck nodes in another, and progression of liver metastases in the third. Evidences of progression has been reported in the other two patients expressing negative immuno-reactivity for CD 117. We conclude that the effect of IM should be assessed only in OM with positive immuno-histochemical c-kit (CD 117) expression. IM might be a potential therapeutic strategy for these patients.","['Fiorentini, G', 'Rossi, S', 'Lanzanova, G', 'Biancalani, M', 'Palomba, A', 'Bernardeschi, P', 'Dentico, P', 'De Giorgi, U']","['Fiorentini G', 'Rossi S', 'Lanzanova G', 'Biancalani M', 'Palomba A', 'Bernardeschi P', 'Dentico P', 'De Giorgi U']","['Department of Oncology , General City Hospital S.

PROCEDURE: Survivors and second malignancies were identified from the BC Cancer Registry. Risk of second malignancy was evaluated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative risk. The effect of demographic, temporal, and disease-related characteristics on risk was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-five second malignancies were observed after 26,071 person-years of follow-up. Relative rate of developing a second malignancy among survivors was 5 times higher than expected (SIR = 5.0, 95% CI, 3.8-6.5), and absolute excess risk was 1.7 deaths per 1,000 person-years. Cumulative incidence of a second malignancy was 5.1% at 25 years after diagnosis of the first cancer. SIRs and absolute excess risk of subsequent cancer was higher among females (SIR = 5.9, 95% CI, 4.5-8.3 and AER = 2.66). While relative risk of second cancer was higher for those diagnosed before 10 years of age (SIR = 10.6, 95% CI, 7.1-16.0), absolute excess risk was slightly higher for those diagnosed after 10 years of age. SIRs were significantly elevated for all follow-up periods, but absolute excess risk of a second cancer was highest among patients surviving more than 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of a subsequent neoplasm is evident among childhood cancer survivors diagnosed in more recent periods than has been previously reported, continues years after diagnosis, and varies according to several risk factors. Continued surveillance is essential to quantify and characterize long-term and changing risks for appropriate follow-up.","['MacArthur, Amy C', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Rogers, Paul C', 'Goddard, Karen J', 'Phillips, Norm', 'McBride, Mary L']","['MacArthur AC', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Rogers PC', 'Goddard KJ', 'Phillips N', 'McBride ML']","['Cancer Control Research Program, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'British Columbia/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",2006/06/13 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/06/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20921 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):453-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20921.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined overall and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort of 2,354 individuals diagnosed with a cancer or tumor prior to 20 years of age between 1970 and 1995 in British Columbia (BC), Canada who survived at least 5 years. PROCEDURE: Late deaths in a survivor cohort ascertained from the BC Cancer Registry were identified using death registrations. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risk of death, and cumulative risk of death were determined. Demographic, temporal, and disease-related factors in risk of late mortality were also assessed. RESULTS: After 24,491 person-years of follow-up, there were 181 deaths, 139 of which were cancer related. Excess risk of late mortality among survivors was 7 deaths per 1,000 person-years at risk (AER = 6.6). Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was ninefold higher relative to the underlying BC population (SMR = 9.1, 95% CI, 7.8-10.5), and was greatest for those with a recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis, and for those diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and nervous system tumors. Absolute excess risk of late death was significantly higher for males and for those diagnosed prior to 1980, but did not vary according to age at diagnosis. Relative mortality was significantly increased due to cancer-related causes of death (SMR = 81.7, 95% CI, 68.6-95.8), as well as circulatory (SMR = 9.7, 95% CI, 4.2-19.1) and respiratory (SMR = 16.8, 95% CI, 4.6-43.0) diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort with long follow-up, there continues to be excess late mortality among childhood and adolescent cancer survivors due to both cancer and non-cancer causes, even among more recently diagnosed survivors.","['MacArthur, Amy C', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Rogers, Paul C', 'Goddard, Karen J', 'Abanto, Zenaida U', 'McBride, Mary L']","['MacArthur AC', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Rogers PC', 'Goddard KJ', 'Abanto ZU', 'McBride ML']","['Cancer Control Research Program, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'British Columbia/epidemiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Risk', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",2006/06/13 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/06/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20922 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):460-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Septins are cytoskeletal GTPases, which form heteropolymeric complexes. They are involved in cytokinesis and other cellular processes, such as vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. SEPT11 has strong homology to SEPT8. Previously, we identified the interaction of SEPT5 and SEPT8. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we now demonstrate that SEPT11 partners with SEPT5. The molecular interaction of SEPT11 with SEPT5 was verified by coprecipitation of SEPT5 and SEPT11 from lysates of the human T-cell leukaemia cell line JURKAT and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The interaction between SEPT5 and SEPT11 requires the GTP-binding domain and the C-terminal extension. Western analysis in various mouse and human tissues revealed that expression of SEPT11 is restricted to the same tissues as those expressing SEPT5, suggesting that SEPT11 and SEPT5 are components of a cell-specific septin complex. SEPT5, which is expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), has been reported to play an important role in exocytosis. We now report that HUVECs also express SEPT11. Given the interactivity between SEPT5 and SEPT11 as shown above and their coexpression in HUVECs, it may be that a complex formed by these two proteins is involved in the exocytosis mechanism in HUVECs.","['Blaser, S', 'Roseler, S', 'Rempp, H', 'Bartsch, I', 'Bauer, H', 'Lieber, M', 'Lessmann, E', 'Weingarten, L', 'Busse, A', 'Huber, M', 'Zieger, B']","['Blaser S', 'Roseler S', 'Rempp H', 'Bartsch I', 'Bauer H', 'Lieber M', 'Lessmann E', 'Weingarten L', 'Busse A', 'Huber M', 'Zieger B']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Freiburg, Mathildenstrasse 1, D-79106 Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Brain Chemistry/genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*physiology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Drug Interactions', 'Endothelial Cells/*physiology', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/chemistry', 'Myocardium/chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Septins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2006/06/13 09:00,2006/09/30 09:00,['2006/06/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2006 Sep;210(1):103-10. doi: 10.1002/path.2013.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Deletion of the SMMHC assembly competence domain (ACD), conserved among skeletal, smooth and nonmuscle myosins, prevents multimerization, inhibition of CBF and inhibition of cell proliferation. To define the amino acids critical for ACD function, three outer surface residues of ACD helices A-D, the subsequent helices E-H or the more N-terminal X or Z helices were now mutated. Variants were assessed for multimerization in low ionic strength in vitro and for nuclear localization as a measure of in vivo multimerization. Mutation of individual helices C-H reduced multimerization, with alteration of the outer surface of helices D or E having the greatest effect. The ability of these SMMHC variants to slow murine myeloid progenitor proliferation largely paralleled their effects on multimerization. Divergence at the boundaries of the ACD may reflect quantitative differences between in vitro and in vivo filament assembly. Each helix mutant retained the ability to bind the mSin3A corepressor.

We show that caspase-10 is activated in etoposide-treated cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A caspase-10 peptide inhibitor, a caspase-10 dominant-negative mutant or a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of the enzyme negatively interfere with drug-induced cell death and caspase-2, -3, -8 and -9 activation. The extrinsic pathway to apoptosis is not involved in drug-induced caspase-10 activation that occurs downstream of Bax redistribution to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from this organelle. siRNA-mediated downregulation of Apaf-1 prevents etoposide-mediated activation of caspase-10. In a cell-free assay, cytochrome c and dATP treatment of cell extracts after immunodepletion of either caspase-3 or caspase-9 indicates that caspase-10 is activated downstream of caspase-9. Then, caspase-10 is involved in a feedback amplification loop that amplifies caspase-9 and -3 activities. Altogether, these data indicate an active role for caspase-10 in cytotoxic drug-induced tumor cell death, downstream of the mitochondria.","['Filomenko, R', 'Prevotat, L', 'Rebe, C', 'Cortier, M', 'Jeannin, J-F', 'Solary, E', 'Bettaieb, A']","['Filomenko R', 'Prevotat L', 'Rebe C', 'Cortier M', 'Jeannin JF', 'Solary E', 'Bettaieb A']","['Inserm U 517, Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, IFR100, Faculty of Medicine, Dijon cedex, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 10/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Recurrence', '*Signal Transduction']",2006/06/13 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/06/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209733 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209733 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Dec 7;25(58):7635-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209733.

Human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). ATL cells are aneuploid, but the causes of aneuploidy are incompletely understood. Here, we show that centrosome amplification is frequent in HTLV-I-transformed cells and that this phenotype is caused by the viral Tax oncoprotein. We also show that the fraction of Tax protein that localizes to centrosomes interacts with TAX1BP2, a novel centrosomal protein composed almost entirely of coiled-coil domains. Overexpression of TAX1BP2 inhibited centrosome duplication, whereas depletion of TAX1BP2 by RNAi resulted in centrosome hyperamplification.

Yet, how these proteins functionally interact is not known. Here, we reveal that STIM1 and Orai1 expressed together reconstitute functional SOCs. Expressed alone, Orai1 strongly reduces store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. However, expressed along with the store-sensing STIM1 protein, Orai1 causes a massive increase in SOCE, enhancing the rate of Ca(2+)entry by up to 103-fold. This entry is entirely store-dependent since the same coexpression causes no measurable store-independent Ca(2+) entry. The entry is completely blocked by the SOC blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. Orai1 and STIM1 coexpression also caused a large gain in CRAC channel function in rat basophilic leukemia cells. The close STIM1 homologue, STIM2, inhibited SOCE when expressed alone but coexpressed with Orai1 caused substantial constitutive (store-independent) Ca(2+) entry. STIM proteins are known to mediate Ca(2+) store-sensing and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane coupling with no intrinsic channel properties. Our results revealing a powerful gain in SOC function dependent on the presence of both Orai1 and STIM1 strongly suggest that Orai1 contributes the PM channel component responsible for Ca(2+) entry. The suppression of SOC function by Orai1 overexpression likely reflects a required stoichiometry between STIM1 and Orai1.","['Soboloff, Jonathan', 'Spassova, Maria A', 'Tang, Xiang D', 'Hewavitharana, Thamara', 'Xu, Wen', 'Gill, Donald L']","['Soboloff J', 'Spassova MA', 'Tang XD', 'Hewavitharana T', 'Xu W', 'Gill DL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201.

For assay readout an ultra-sensitive fluorescence scanner with submicrometer resolution was used. To minimize autofluorescence 150-microm thin glass slides with an aldehyde-functionalized surface were developed. These methodological improvements allowed the detection of 5'mC in synthetic oligonucleotides hybridized to microarrays with atto molar analytical sensitivity.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying JWA gene function involved in oxidative stress is still unknown. In this study, the potential role of JWA was further investigated in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced DNA damage and cell apoptosis in K562 cells. Series of the oxidative stress models were established to observe if JWA was involved in DNA damage or cell apoptosis induced by H2O2 exposure. These results indicated that the inhibitory effect on K562 cells' viability induced by H2O2 was concentration and time dependent. JWA was more sensitive to H2O2 (0.01 mmol/L) than the heat-shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp27), and its expression pattern was similar to that of hsp70. In addition, JWA, hsp70, hsp27, and p53 were overexpressed and the expression patterns of JWA, hsp70, and p53 were similar during cell apoptosis. H2O2 led to the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3. In conclusion, these results suggested that JWA might be an effective environmental responsive gene that functions as a parallel with hsp70 in oxidative stress-responsive pathways in K562 cells. Like hsp70, JWA might enhance intracellular defenses and function against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in leukemia cells. At the same time, JWA was involved in the p53-associated signal pathways of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, which is also caspase-3 dependent.","['Zhu, Ting', 'Chen, Rui', 'Li, Aiping', 'Liu, Jia', 'Gu, Dengan', 'Liu, Qizhan', 'C Chang, Hebron', 'Zhou, Jianwei']","['Zhu T', 'Chen R', 'Li A', 'Liu J', 'Gu D', 'Liu Q', 'C Chang H', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratories of Human Functional Genomics and of Applied Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Furthermore, relapse and resistance to treatment often occur despite continued treatment with ATRA. Thereafter, combination treatment strategies have been suggested to circumvent these problems. The present study demonstrates that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a major component of honeybee propolis, enhanced ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in HL-60, a human promyelocytic cell line. The differentiation was assessed by Wright-Giemsa stain, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and membrane differentiation marker CD11b. In addition, CAPE enhanced ATRA-induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by decreasing the association of cdk2-cyclin E complex. Finally, it was demonstrated that CAPE promoted the ATRA-mediated nuclear transcription activation of RARalpha assessed by EMSA assay and enhanced the expression of target genes including RARalpha, C/EBPepsilon, and p21 protein resulting in the differentiation development of leukemia.

Incubation of isolated mitochondria with a lysate of U937 cells that had been treated with GGO resulted in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Utilizing this cell-free system, we purified a 21-kDa protein that induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and appeared to be involved in the apoptosis that is induced in U937 cells by GGO. We designated this protein cytochrome c-releasing factor 21 (CRF21). Overexpression of CRF21 in HeLa cells induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, with subsequent apoptosis.

In this study, we determined the enhancing activities of these derivatives on 1,25-(OH)2D3- and ATRA-induced differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Importantly, some of these derivatives were found to synergistically enhance the differentiation of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner when coupled with low doses of either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or ATRA.

Previously, we identified an inherited syndrome of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and radio-ulnar synostosis that is associated with a point mutation in the third helix of HOXA11 homeodomain (HOXA11-DeltaH3). Here, we demonstrate that this mutation results in a significantly truncated protein with impaired DNA-binding efficiency. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirm that wild-type HOXA11 (HOXA11-WT) interacts in vitro with the DNA-binding consensus sequence for HOXA11, and that this interaction is most efficient when the TALE transcription factor, Meis1b, is also present. However, the binding between HOXA11-DeltaH3 and DNA is abrogated even in the presence of Meis1b, suggesting the point mutant causes a disruption in the DNA-binding capacity. We investigated whether the point mutation also affected the physical protein-protein interaction between HoxA11 and Meis1b. Using GST pulldown assays, we find Meis1b interactions with both HOXA11-WT and HOXA11-DeltaH3 in the presence of DNA. DNAse treatment decreased these interactions, suggesting that the interaction is a protein-protein association, and DNA may serve to stabilize this interaction. Stable expression of FLAG-HOXA11-WT or -DeltaH3 in K562 cells significantly impacts megakaryocytic differentiation. Staurosporine (STSP) induced K562 cells to differentiate into a megakaryocytic phenotype. Treatment leads to an increase in surface expression of the megakaryocytic/platelet-specific antigen, CD61, and causes morphological changes consistent with megakaryocytic differentiation. CD61 surface expression on STSP treated HOXA11-WT and -DeltaH3 expressing cells was significantly reduced as compared to untransfected K562 cells. Interestingly, we found only a slight difference in CD61 expression between wild-type and mutant HOXA11 K562. These data suggest that HoxA11 inhibition of differentiation may involve nonhomeodomain sequences. Finally, our laboratory has detected a small amount of HoxA11 mRNA in cells isolated from unfractionated human cord blood and murine ES cell culture cocultured on OP9 for 6 days in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This finding suggests HoxA11 may be endogenously expressed in very early hematopoietic precursor cells. Taken together, these data begin to give us insight into the molecular mechanisms by which HoxA11 may be involved in regulating megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Horvat-Switzer, Regina D', 'Thompson, Alexis A']","['Horvat-Switzer RD', 'Thompson AA']","[""Molecular and Cellular Pathobiology Program, Children's Memorial Research Center, Division of Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL 60614, USA.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (HOXA11 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Radius', '*Synostosis', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Ulna']",2006/06/13 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2006/06/13 09:00'],"['2006/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(06)00088-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2006.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2006 Jul-Aug;37(1):55-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2006.04.001.

Additionally, a silent polymorphism (T1025T) was found in two of 20 MDS samples, one of 43 NHL samples, two of 40 osteosarcoma samples and Ishikawa. The polymorphism was established by identifying two of 92 normal samples with the same change.

However CD117 is also expressed in some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. CD34 is highly expressed in both ALL and ANLL. This study was to explore the clinical significance of the co-expression of CD117/CD34 in adult patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect the positive rate and expression level of CD117 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of 92 patients with ALL and 81 patients with ANLL. The difference between the rates of CD117 expression and CD117/CD34 co-expression in ALL patients and the difference of CD117/CD34 co-expression between ALL and ANLL patients were compared. Twenty healthy individuals were set as controls. RESULTS: The positive rate of CD117 was significantly lower in ALL than in ANLL (15.2% vs. 71.6%, P<0.001). The co-expression rate of CD117/CD34 was significantly lower in ALL than in ANLL (5.4% vs. 55.5%, P<0.001). The positive rate of CD117 was significantly higher than co-expression rate of CD117/CD34 in ALL (15.2% vs. 5.4%, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: CD117 may be used as an immunologic marker for acute myeloid leukemia. The co-expression rate of CD117/CD34 is lower than that of CD117 alone in ALL, and therefore, this may be used in the exclusive diagnosis of ALL.","['Shi, Hao', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Xiao, Ai-Qin', 'Zhang, Zhi-Rong', 'Zhang, Ri']","['Shi H', 'Zhu F', 'Xiao AQ', 'Zhang ZR', 'Zhang R']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital, Taishan Medical College, Taian, Shandong, 271000, P.

Therapeutic neglect and legitimate concerns about toxicity are responsible. Yet randomized phase III data in the elderly have demonstrated a survival benefit for single-agent chemotherapy compared with best supportive care, and retrospective analyses of fit elderly patients enrolled on platinum agent-based trials have shown similar survival rates, albeit more toxicity, compared with younger counterparts. To date, however, there are no phase III trials specific to the elderly population demonstrating a survival benefit for platinum agent-based combinations compared with the constituent nonplatinum single agent; such efforts are ongoing. Performance status is a critical prognostic factor in advanced-stage NSCLC. Retrospective analyses of multiple trials conducted before 1995 suggested that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC and compromised PS experienced substantial toxicity and virtually no benefit from systemic chemotherapy, leading most cooperative groups to suspend research in this cohort. But this trend has changed. A subset analysis of patients with a PS of 2 enrolled on a recent Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial showed a significant survival benefit for carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone, and recent randomized phase II efforts evaluating platinum agent-based combinations have yielded median survival times of > 6 months with acceptable toxicity rates. Although the Selective Targeting for Efficacy in Lung Cancer, Lower Adverse Reaction trials testing polyglutamated paclitaxel failed to show a survival advantage compared with standard agents, interest in testing new, less toxic agents continues.

METHODS: The bone marrow tissues were obtained by trephine biopsy from 272 patients, and then put on the slides to make the imprints. The imprints was stained by Wright-Giemsa method, and the bone marrow smears and imprints were examined simultaneously according to the bone marrow cellularity criteria. RESULT: In bone marrow cellularity, four grades (distinct decrease, extreme decrease, distinct increase, and extreme increase) were significantly higher in bone marrow imprints than those in bone marrow smears (P <0.05), but there was no significantly differences between bone marrow imprints and sections (P >0.05). Using bone marrow sections as standard, in cellularily decreasing samples, the consistent rate of bone marrow imprints and smears were both high (84.4% and 97.9%), in the group of the normal and increased cellularity, the consistent rate of the bone marrow imprints (84.4% and 97.7%) was significantly higher than that in smears (60% and 64%, P<0.01). The sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, positive predictive value and positive likelihood rate of bone marrow imprints were all higher than those of the smears. Using the bone marrow sections as gold standard, in 124 cases with decreased cellularity in smears, the positive diagnosis rate for aplastic anemia and dyshaematopoiesis based on bone marrow imprints was 37.1% with a false positive rate of 7.3% which was lower than that of the bone marrow smears (false positive rate of 29.8%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: To evaluate bone marrow cellularity, bone marrow imprint is better than bone marrow smear. The combination of the two examinations can make the diagnosis more convenient and quicker.","['Lu, Xing-guo', 'Huang, Lian-sheng', 'Xu, Xiao-hua', 'Yang, Jun-jun', 'Zhu, Lei', 'Zhao, Xiao-ying', 'Xu, Gen-bo']","['Lu XG', 'Huang LS', 'Xu XH', 'Yang JJ', 'Zhu L', 'Zhao XY', 'Xu GB']","['Department of Haematol, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China. xingguolu@163.com']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

It is generally considered a favorable prognostic indicator. Some TEL-AML1+ ALL patients present at diagnosis with extra copies of the fusion, enumerated by FISH. The aim of the study was to determine whether additional copies of TEL-AML1 have clinical significance. PROCEDURE: Charts of all TEL-AML1+ ALL patients at the UM and Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota between 1996 and 2004 were reviewed. RESULTS: Eight patients (7 males/1 female, mean age 46 months) with two or more TEL-AML1 fusion signals and 24 with single TEL-AML1 fusion signals (18 males/6 females, mean age 52 months) were identified. There was no statistically significant difference in age or gender between the two groups. Patients with double TEL-AML1+ had a higher frequency of myeloid markers CD13 (P = 0.04) or CD33 (P = 0.003) than single TEL-AML1+ patients. Single TEL-AML1+ patients had higher WBC (P = 0.04) than double TEL-AML1+ patients. A trend toward slower therapy response was seen in double TEL-AML1+ patients versus single, (1 of 7 [14%] <5% marrow blasts on Day 7 vs. 13 of 23 [56%], P = 0.09). Double TEL-AML1+ patients had a higher relapse rate (P = 0.09) than single TEL-AML1+ patients. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing FISH to distinguish subgroups of TEL-AML1 fusion patients may have important prognostic implications. The presence of an extra fusion may portend poorer prognosis. A larger and longer-term follow-up study will be required to verify the possible clinical significance of the presence of multiple TEL-AML1 fusions.","['Al-Sweedan, Suleimman A', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Steiner, Marie E', 'Bostrom, Bruce C', 'Casey, Timothy', 'Hirsch, Betsy A']","['Al-Sweedan SA', 'Neglia JP', 'Steiner ME', 'Bostrom BC', 'Casey T', 'Hirsch BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/06/10 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20911 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 May;48(5):510-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20911.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro data demonstrated that all of them showed higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin against the human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line (A-549), the human stomach carcinoma cell line (SGC-7901), the human cervix carcinoma cell line (HELA), the human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116), the human liver carcinoma cell line (BEL-7402), the murine leukemia cell line (P-388) and the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). Complex 3 exhibits the highest activity, with growth inhibition rates of over 80% at 10(-8) mol L(-1) against the A-549, HCT-116 and HELA tumor cell lines. Interestingly, ligands L1-L4 are also very cytotoxic against the cell lines tested. Complexes 1-4 are stable in aqueous solution for 2 days in the presence of the biological reducing agent glutathione. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry data showed that DNA isolated from cells treated with complexes 1 and 3 contained gold with gold-to-nucleotide ratios of approximately 1:6,400 and 1:4,900, respectively. Fluorescence titration, UV and circular dichroism analyses proved that the steric and electrostatic effects of the ligand remarkably influence the interactions of their gold(III) complexes with DNA. The DNA binding ability of the complexes has been correlated with their cytotoxicity, which could potentially provide a new rationale for the future design of terpyridine-based metal complexes with antitumor potential.","['Shi, Pengfei', 'Jiang, Qin', 'Zhao, Yongmei', 'Zhang, Yangmiao', 'Lin, Jun', 'Lin, Liping', 'Ding, Jian', 'Guo, Zijian']","['Shi P', 'Jiang Q', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Lin J', 'Lin L', 'Ding J', 'Guo Z']","[""State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Pyridines)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'NH9L3PP67S (pyridine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Gold/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Pyridines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', '*Static Electricity']",2006/06/10 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00775-006-0120-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2006 Sep;11(6):745-52. doi: 10.1007/s00775-006-0120-y.

Oligonucleotide arrays with 112 apoptotic genes were used, and data analysis was performed on seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 10 follicular lymphoma frozen tumor samples from six and seven patients, respectively. The overall gene expression pattern was strikingly similar among all 17 samples, regardless of the type of lymphoma and history of chemotherapy exposure. MCL1, TNFRSF1B and TNFRSF7 were highly expressed in most cases. The apoptotic gene expression between the groups of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=3) and untreated follicular lymphoma (n=6) was also similar (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.94). Comparison between the groups of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=3) and postchemotherapy chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=4) revealed six genes with >2-fold changes, including BIRC5/Survivin that was higher in the postchemotherapy samples. This finding was validated by immunohistochemistry. Similar analysis of follicular lymphoma cases did not identify any significant differences. To conclude, our findings suggest that chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma share common apoptotic defects, and highlight the importance of MCL1 and the TNF pathway.

Here we report that tissue transglutaminase (TG2), a protein cross-linking enzyme, was induced, then partially translocated into the nucleus, and became strongly associated with the chromatin during the differentiation process. The transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-link content of both the cytosolic and the nuclear protein fractions increased while NB4 cells underwent cellular maturation. Inhibition of cross-linking activity of TG2 by monodansylcadaverin in these cells led to diminished nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) positivity, production of less superoxide anion, and decreased expression of GP91PHOX, the membrane-associated subunit of NADPH oxidase. Neutrophils isolated from TG2(-/-) mice showed diminished NBT reduction capacity, reduced superoxide anion formation, and down-regulation of the gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase, compared with wild-type cells. It was also observed that TG2(-/-) mice exhibited increased neutrophil phagocytic activity, but had attenuated neutrophil chemotaxis and impaired neutrophil extravasation with higher neutrophil counts in their circulation during yeast extract-induced peritonitis. These results clearly suggest that TG2 may modulate the expression of genes related to neutrophil functions and is involved in several intracellular and extracellular functions of extravasating neutrophil.","['Balajthy, Zoltan', 'Csomos, Krisztian', 'Vamosi, Gyorgy', 'Szanto, Attila', 'Lanotte, Michel', 'Fesus, Laszlo']","['Balajthy Z', 'Csomos K', 'Vamosi G', 'Szanto A', 'Lanotte M', 'Fesus L']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Debrecen, Medical and Health Science Center, H-4012 Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Hungary. zoli@indi.biochem.dote.hu']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Cybb protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'DNA/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*enzymology/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*enzymology/physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transglutaminases/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/06/10 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52585-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-02-007948 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Sep 15;108(6):2045-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-02-007948.

Previous studies in animal models have shown that oncogenic NRAS is unable to induce myeloid malignancies effectively, and it was suggested that oncogenic NRAS might only act as a secondary mutation in leukemogenesis. In this study, we examined the leukemogenicity of NRAS using an improved mouse bone marrow transduction and transplantation model. We found that oncogenic NRAS rapidly and efficiently induced chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)- or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)- like disease in mice, indicating that mutated NRAS can function as an initiating oncogene in the induction of myeloid malignancies. In addition to CMML and AML, we found that NRAS induced mastocytosis in mice. This result indicates that activation of the RAS pathway also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis. The mouse model for NRAS leukemogenesis established here provides a system for further studying the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies and for testing relevant therapies.","['Parikh, Chaitali', 'Subrahmanyam, Ramesh', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Parikh C', 'Subrahmanyam R', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, MS029, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110, USA.']",,['eng'],['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2006/06/10 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52518-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-009498 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 1;108(7):2349-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-009498.

SALL4B transgenic mice developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like features and subsequently AML that was transplantable. Increased apoptosis associated with dysmyelopoiesis was evident in transgenic mouse marrow and colony-formation (CFU) assays. Both isoforms could bind to beta-catenin and synergistically enhanced the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our data suggest that the constitutive expression of SALL4 causes MDS/AML, most likely through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

Ultrastructural examination of Scl-null megakaryocytes revealed a disorganized demarcation membrane and reduction in platelet granules. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that Scl-null platelets lacked NF-E2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated Scl binding to the NF-E2 promoter in the human megakaryoblastic-cell line Meg-01, along with its binding partners E47, Lmo2, and the cofactors Ldb1 and GATA-2.

Several agents targeting STPs are under development; however, redundancy and cross-talk between STPs could activate multiple downstream effectors and this could negate the effect of single-target inhibition. The frequency of concurrent activation of multiple STPs in AML and the prognostic relevance of STP activation in AML are unknown. STP protein expression (PKCalpha, ERK2, pERK2, AKT, and pAKT) was measured by Western blot in samples from 188 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated AML. In univariate and multivariate analysis high levels of PKCalpha, ERK, pERK, and pAKT, but not AKT, were adverse factors for survival as was the combination variable PKCalpha-ERK2&pERK2-pAKT. Survival progressively decreased as the number of activated pathways increased. Patients were more likely to have none or all 3 pathways activated than was predicted based on the frequency of individual pathway activation, strongly suggesting that cross-activation occurred. Simultaneous activation of multiple STPs is common in AML and has a progressively worse adverse effect on prognosis.

Such activation requires upstream engagement of p38 MAPK, as demonstrated by experiments using pharmacological inhibitors of p38 or p38alpha knock-out cells. Arsenic-induced apoptosis was enhanced in cells in which MSK1 expression was decreased using small interfering RNA and in Msk1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that this kinase is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner to regulate As2O3 responses. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of MSK1 enhanced the suppressive effects of As2O3 on the growth of primary leukemic progenitors from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients.

METHODS: miR-181a RNA duplexes were designed and synthesized according to the mature sequence of miR-181a. Forty-eight hours after transfection of in vitro cultured K562 cells using Oligofectamine, gene expression profiles of the cells were studied and analyzed using Agilent Human 1A Oligo microarray. RESULTS: Totalling 228 differentially expressed genes were identified from the 20,173 screened genes, including 59 up-regulated ones (consisting of metabolism-associated genes, tumor suppressor genes, signal transduction-associated genes, immunity and defense-associated genes etc), and 169 down-regulated ones (consisting of oncogenes, DNA-binding and transcription genes, metabolism-associated genes, signal transduction-associated genes, cell cycle and development-associated genes etc.) in the transfected K562 cells as compared with the control K562 cells. Changes in expressions of CTCF, ZAP70, SEMA4C and RALA were confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: miR-181a transfection for 48 h induces gene expression profile changes in K562 cells, indicating the functionality of the miR-181a. These differentially expressed genes are related to the functions of the microRNA, and may also be the basis of the regulation model of posttranscriptional gene silencing. These findings provide an evidence for further study of the machineries and functions of the microRNA in mammalian cells.","['Zhou, Jue-yu', 'Ma, Wen-li', 'Fei, Jia', 'Ding, Da-peng', 'Shi, Rong', 'Jiang, Li', 'Zheng, Wen-ling']","['Zhou JY', 'Ma WL', 'Fei J', 'Ding DP', 'Shi R', 'Jiang L', 'Zheng WL']","['Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. zhoujueyu@yahoo.com.cn']",,['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2006/06/10 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2006 May;26(5):606-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to report the clinical characteristics and outcome of all children and young adults 10-19 years of age diagnosed with ALL in Denmark between 1992 and 2001. MATERIAL: The study includes 99 patients 10-19 years of age with ALL in Denmark during a ten year period found in the complete NOPHO (Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology) registry and through the Danish Cancer Registry and local pathology databases. Data were retrieved by reviewing medical charts of the patients. A total of 61 children (10-14 years) treated on pediatric protocols and 38 young adults (15-19 years) were diagnosed with ALL. Data were reported as of January 1st 2005. RESULTS: There were no difference with respect to the distribution of T-ALL, CNS-leukemia, total white blood count and high risk chromosomal abnormalities between the two groups. There was a statistical significant lower event free survival (p<0.01) and lower overall survival (p<0.01) in young adults compared with 10-14 year-old children (0.38 vs 0.60 and 0.47 vs 0.67). There were more transplant-related deaths in the young adults. Higher treatment intensity in children may be an additional explanatory factor. Children received more prednisone, vincristine and high-dose methotrexate than young adults. CONCLUSION: Young adult patients with ALL might benefit from therapy with pediatric NOPHO ALL protocols.","['Schroder, H', 'Kjeldahl, M', 'Boesen, A M', 'Nielsen, O J', 'Schmidt, K', 'Johnsen, H E', 'Gregersen, H', 'Heyman, M', 'Gustafsson, G']","['Schroder H', 'Kjeldahl M', 'Boesen AM', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Schmidt K', 'Johnsen HE', 'Gregersen H', 'Heyman M', 'Gustafsson G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus, Skejby Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. hsa@sks.aaa.dk']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Dan Med Bull,Danish medical bulletin,0066040,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/06/10 09:00,2006/08/02 09:00,['2006/06/10 09:00'],"['2006/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dan Med Bull. 2006 Feb;53(1):76-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had not received any blood transfusion in the 6 months before BMT. From day 0 to day + 68 he received four red blood cell concentrates and 18 platelet concentrates. The bone marrow donor had been HBs ag and anti-HBc negative. INVESTIGATIONS: A stored serum sample of the recipient obtained on day -8 was available and proved to be negative for HBsAg and Anti-HBc IgM, but positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs. A serum sample from day -22 was negative for all these parameters. DIAGNOSIS: These results can be explained by the administration of 17.5 g of a polyvalent immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrate for CMV prophylaxis on day -9: anti-HBc and anti-HBs (1814 IU/l) were found in the lot that the patient had received. Nine further doses of immunoglobulin concentrates were given up to day + 68. COURSE: Four months after the last administration of Ig concentrates, the patient was negative for HBs ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs. CONCLUSION: Ig concentrates contain not only those antibodies, which are given to a patient for treatment, but also all other antibodies contained in the donor plasma pool. Thus administration of Ig concentrates can cause a ""false-positive"" hepatitis B serology by passive transfer of these antibodies. Such an artificial seroconversion may also lead to a false suspicion of a transfusion transmitted hepatitis B infection.","['Strobel, E', 'Schoniger, M']","['Strobel E', 'Schoniger M']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Immunologie und Krankenhaushygiene, Klinikum Schwabing, Stadtisches Klinikum Munchen GmbH.

With PMA, ERK stimulated MCL1 mRNA expression and ML-1 cell differentiation, and ERK additionally stabilized expression of the MCL1 protein. However, with MTDAs, transient ERK and ensuing JNK activation contributed to initial MCL1 upregulation and viability-retention, but sustained JNK activation eventually resulted in cell death. MCL1 was upregulated by PMA in THP-1 and U937 myeloid leukemia cells, but by MTDAs only in THP-1 cells. MCL1 expression was constitutively elevated in multiple myeloma cell lines, and was not affected by PMA/ERK or MTDAs. Thus, MCL1 expression level and sensitivity to regulation are important considerations in selecting approaches for targeting this antiapoptotic gene product to kill cancer cells.","['Vrana, Julie A', 'Cleaveland, Emily S', 'Eastman, Alan', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Vrana JA', 'Cleaveland ES', 'Eastman A', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 53759/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/*physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2006/06/09 09:00,2007/01/27 09:00,['2006/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-7787-y [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Aug;11(8):1275-88. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-7787-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that FLT3 may contribute to leukemogenesis in a patient with myeloproliferative disorder and a t(12;13)(p13;q12) translocation through generating a fusion gene with the ETS variant gene 6 (ETV6) gene. ETV6 has been reported to fuse to various partner genes, including TK and transcription factors. Both ETV6/FLT3 and reciprocal FLT3/ETV6 transcripts were detected in the patient mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. At the protein level, however, only ETV6/FLT3 products were expressed. Among them, one retains the helix-loop-helix (HLH) oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the JM as well as TK domain of FLT3. FLT3 receptor in leukemic cells might be inappropriately activated through dimerization by HLH domain of ETV6, which consequently interfered with proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.","['Vu, H A', 'Xinh, P T', 'Masuda, M', 'Motoji, T', 'Toyoda, A', 'Sakaki, Y', 'Tokunaga, K', 'Sato, Y']","['Vu HA', 'Xinh PT', 'Masuda M', 'Motoji T', 'Toyoda A', 'Sakaki Y', 'Tokunaga K', 'Sato Y']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Ultrafine Structure, Research Institute of International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2006/06/09 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404266 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404266 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1414-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404266.

These cases have a poor prognosis with current therapy. The FLT3 kinase is overexpressed and constitutively activated in MLL-rearranged ALL cells. The FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 selectively kills these cells, but is unlikely to be curative if used as monotherapy. To identify potentially synergistic combination strategies, we studied CEP-701 and six standard chemotherapeutic agents in three sequences of exposure (S1: chemotherapy followed by CEP-701, S2: simultaneous exposure to both; and S3: CEP-701 followed by chemotherapy) using MLL-rearranged ALL cell lines and patient bone marrow samples. MTT cytotoxicity and annexin V binding apoptosis assays were used to assess antileukemic effects. Combination indices (CI) were calculated for each combination (CI<0.9 - synergistic; CI 0.9-1.1 - additive; CI>1.1 - antagonistic). A striking pattern of sequence-dependent synergy was observed: S1 was markedly synergistic (mean CI=0.59+/-0.10), S2 was additive (mean CI=0.99+/-0.09) and S3 was antagonistic (mean CI=1.23+/-0.10). The sequence dependence is attributable to the effect of CEP-701 on cell cycle kinetics, and is mediated specifically by FLT3 inhibition, as these effects are not seen in control cells without activated FLT3.","['Brown, P', 'Levis, M', 'McIntyre, E', 'Griesemer, M', 'Small, D']","['Brown P', 'Levis M', 'McIntyre E', 'Griesemer M', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",,['eng'],"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Carbazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Furans', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/06/09 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404277 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404277 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1368-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404277.

Ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in myeloid progenitors expressing the BCR/ABL oncogene inhibits proliferation, induces differentiation and suppresses leukemogenesis in mice, but C/EBPalpha is markedly more effective than C/EBPbeta.

Gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit have been described in a number of human cancers, including testicular germinomas, acute myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

Without Kit mutations, these mice suffer from a benign disease whose hallmark is erythropoietin-dependent expansion of undifferentiated red blood cell precursors. Newly acquired Kit mutations affect codon 814 or 818, and ectopic expression of these mutants in nonmalignant pro-erythroblasts confers erythropoietin independence and tumorigenicity. Using tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1, PP2, and imatinib mesylate (a.k.a.

We also show that a catalytically inactive AMSH inhibits retroviral budding in a dominant-negative manner and induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of an endosomal cargo, namely murine leukemia virus Gag. Finally, VPS4 and AMSH compete for binding to the C-terminal regions of CHMP1A and CHMP1B, revealing a coordinated interaction with ESCRT-III. Taken together, these results are consistent with a role of AMSH in the deubiquitination of the endosomal cargo preceding lysosomal degradation.","['Agromayor, Monica', 'Martin-Serrano, Juan']","['Agromayor M', 'Martin-Serrano J']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London School of Medicine at Guy's, King's College, and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom.""]",,['eng'],['G0400207/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (STAMBP protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Endopeptidases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Protein Transport', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'src Homology Domains']",2006/06/09 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)47649-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M513803200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Aug 11;281(32):23083-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M513803200.

We examined whether gene-expression profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients with aggressive lymphomas were profiled for gene expression and were also classified according to morphology, immunohistochemistry, and detection of the t(8;14) c-myc translocation. RESULTS: A classifier based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically verified cases of classic Burkitt's lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma by the high level of expression of c-myc target genes, the expression of a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes, and the low level of expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and nuclear factor-kappaB target genes. Eight specimens with a pathological diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma had the typical gene-expression profile of Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting they represent cases of Burkitt's lymphoma that are difficult to diagnose by current methods. Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, the overall survival was superior among those who had received intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Gene-expression profiling is an accurate, quantitative method for distinguishing Burkitt's lymphoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.","['Dave, Sandeep S', 'Fu, Kai', 'Wright, George W', 'Lam, Lloyd T', 'Kluin, Philip', 'Boerma, Evert-Jan', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Ott, German', 'Muller-Hermelink, Hans-Konrad', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Rimsza, Lisa M', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'Grogan, Thomas M', 'Campo, Elias', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Dave, Bhavana J', 'Sanger, Warren', 'Bast, Martin', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Armitage, James O', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Kvaloy, Stein', 'Holte, Harald', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Miller, Thomas P', 'Montserrat, Emilio', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Bahl, Manisha', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Yang, Liming', 'Powell, John', 'Simon, Richard', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Dave SS', 'Fu K', 'Wright GW', 'Lam LT', 'Kluin P', 'Boerma EJ', 'Greiner TC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Rosenwald A', 'Ott G', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Delabie J', 'Rimsza LM', 'Braziel RM', 'Grogan TM', 'Campo E', 'Jaffe ES', 'Dave BJ', 'Sanger W', 'Bast M', 'Vose JM', 'Armitage JO', 'Connors JM', 'Smeland EB', 'Kvaloy S', 'Holte H', 'Fisher RI', 'Miller TP', 'Montserrat E', 'Wilson WH', 'Bahl M', 'Zhao H', 'Yang L', 'Powell J', 'Simon R', 'Chan WC', 'Staudt LM']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md, USA.']",['Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project'],['eng'],"['UO1-CA84967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/06/09 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['354/23/2431 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa055759 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2006 Jun 8;354(23):2431-42. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa055759.,,,['Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],"['N Engl J Med. 2006 Jun 8;354(23):2495-8.

Mothers of 158 children with Down's syndrome and acute leukemia (97 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 61 acute myeloid leukemia) diagnosed between January 1997 and October 2002 and mothers of 173 children with Down's syndrome but without leukemia were interviewed by telephone. Positive associations were found between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and maternal exposure to professional pest exterminations (odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 4.49), to any pesticide (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 4.39), and to any chemical (odds ratio = 2.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 6.35).

We investigated whether radon exposure is associated with increased incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma in this population. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case-cohort study in 23,043 uranium miners and identified a total of 177 incident cases of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. Detailed information on occupational radon exposure was obtained for the cases and a randomly selected subcohort of 2,393 subjects. We used the proportional hazards model with power relative risk (RR) function to estimate and test the effects of cumulative radon exposures on incidence rates. RESULTS: Incidence of all leukemia combined and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) alone was positively associated with cumulative radon exposure. The RR comparing high radon exposure [110 working level months (WLM) ; 80th percentile] to low radon exposure (3 WLM ; 20th percentile) was 1.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) , 1.10-2.78 ; p = 0.014] for all leukemia combined and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.10-3.59 ; p = 0.016) for CLL. Myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma were also associated with radon, but RRs were not statistically significant. There was no apparent association of radon with either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Exposure to radon and its progeny was associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia in underground uranium miners.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Immunohistochemical staining of glycodelin, ultrastructural immunostaining of glycodelin, and double staining of glycodelin and PRB. RESULT(S): Glycodelin is present in the glands when pinopodes appear. Glycodelin is localized on pinopodes but is also secreted from luminal epithelial cells regardless of pinopode formation. There was a negative correlation between glycodelin secretion from the glands and PRB staining. A weak correlation between the presence of LIFR (but not LIF) and glycodelin was found. CONCLUSION(S): Pinopode appearance, intense staining of LIFR in pinopodes and glycodelin staining in the glands are synchronized events.

The associated long-term risks of infection remain poorly defined. METHODS: From July 2001 through December 2003, all patients who received alemtuzumab for the treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders at 1 institution underwent a retrospective evaluation to document infectious complications until death or end of follow-up in October 2004. Alemtuzumab recipients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were compared with a concurrent cohort who also underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but did not receive alemtuzumab. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were identified (21 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 6 with plasma cell disorders). The overall mortality was 37%, with 7 of 10 deaths being related to infection. Significant opportunistic infections occurred in 9 patients (43%) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including cytomegalovirus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, adenovirus, toxoplasmosis, and acanthamaebiasis. Thirty nonopportunistic infections in 22 patients (82%) were also identified. The 3 deaths related to nonopportunistic infections all involved Enterococcus species bacteremia. When compared with a concurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia cohort that underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, alemtuzumab recipients had an incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation of 66.7% (6 of 9 patients), compared with 37% in the non-alemtuzumab group (10 of 27 patients; P = .15), and an incidence of post-transplant opportunistic infections (excluding herpesviruses) of 44.4% (compared with 29.6% in the non-alemtuzumab group; P = .41). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of herpesvirus and Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis, serious infectious complications occur in patients receiving alemtuzumab for lymphoproliferative disorders. Infectious complications are more varied and diverse in patients receiving alemtuzumab than has been reported in trials to date.","['Martin, Stanley I', 'Marty, Francisco M', 'Fiumara, Karen', 'Treon, Steven P', 'Gribben, John G', 'Baden, Lindsey R']","['Martin SI', 'Marty FM', 'Fiumara K', 'Treon SP', 'Gribben JG', 'Baden LR']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. simartin100@gmail.com""]",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2005/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID38899 [pii]', '10.1086/504811 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2006 Jul 1;43(1):16-24. doi: 10.1086/504811.

THP induced apoptosis in human leukemia cell line HL-60 cells, but did not in its hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant clone HP100. THP-induced DNA ladder formation in HL-60 cells was inhibited by a metal chelator. THP induced damage to (32)P-labeled DNA fragments in the presence of metals. In the presence of Fe(III)EDTA, THP caused DNA damage at every nucleotide. The DNA damage was inhibited by free hydroxy radical ((.)OH) scavengers and catalase, suggesting that the Fe(III)EDTA-mediated DNA damage is mainly due to (.)OH generation. In the presence of Cu(II), THP caused DNA damage mainly at T and G of 5'-TG-3' sequence. The inhibitive effect of catalase and bathocuproine on Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage suggested that H(2)O(2) and Cu(I) participate in the DNA damage.

Using a tumor-protection model, we demonstrate here that GVL activity following administration of DLIs to established mixed chimeras is dependent primarily on reactivity to allogeneic MHC antigens rather than minor histocompatibility or tumor-associated antigens. CD8(+) T-cell-dependent GVL responses against an MHC class II-negative tumor following delayed DLI require CD4(+) T-cell help and are reduced significantly when host APCs lack MHC class II expression. CD4(+) T cells primed by host APCs were required for maximal expansion of graft-versus-host reactive CD8(+) T cells but not their synthesis of IFN-gamma. In contrast, the GVL requirement for CD4(+) T-cell help was bypassed almost completely when DLI was administered to freshly irradiated recipients, indicating that the host environment is a major factor influencing the cellular mechanisms of GVL.","['Chakraverty, Ronjon', 'Eom, Hyeon-Seok', 'Sachs, Jessica', 'Buchli, Jennifer', 'Cotter, Pete', 'Hsu, Richard', 'Zhao, Guiling', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Chakraverty R', 'Eom HS', 'Sachs J', 'Buchli J', 'Cotter P', 'Hsu R', 'Zhao G', 'Sykes M']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, MGH-East, 13th Street, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA 79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Tissue Donors']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52592-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-007427 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Sep 15;108(6):2106-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-007427.

Fli-1 (friend leukemia integration 1), an Ets transcription factor, is required for the normal maturation of megakaryocytes and controls the expression of multiple megakaryocyte-specific genes. However, in Fli-1-/- mice, early megakaryopoiesis persists, and the expression of the early megakaryocyte-specific genes, alphaIIb and cMpl, is maintained, consistent with functional compensation by a related Ets factor(s). Here we identify the Ets protein GABPalpha (GA-binding protein alpha) as a regulator of early megakaryocyte-specific genes. Notably, GABPalpha preferentially occupies Ets elements of early megakaryocyte-specific genes in vitro and in vivo, whereas Fli-1 binds both early and late megakaryocyte-specific genes. Moreover, the ratio of GABPalpha/Fli-1 expression declines throughout megakaryocyte maturation. Consistent with this expression pattern, primary fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes from Fli-1-deficient murine embryos exhibit reduced expression of genes associated with late stages of maturation (glycoprotein [GP] Ibalpha, GPIX, and platelet factor 4 [PF4]), whereas GABPalpha-deficient megakaryocytes were mostly impaired in the expression of early megakaryocyte-specific genes (alphaIIb and cMpl). Finally, mechanistic experiments revealed that GABPalpha, like Fli-1, can impart transcriptional synergy between the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 and its cofactor FOG-1 (friend of GATA-1). In concert, these data reveal disparate, but overlapping, functions of Ets transcription factors at distinct stages of megakaryocyte maturation.","['Pang, Liyan', 'Xue, Hai-Hui', 'Szalai, Gabor', 'Wang, Xun', 'Wang, Yuhuan', 'Watson, Dennis K', 'Leonard, Warren J', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Poncz, Mortimer']","['Pang L', 'Xue HH', 'Szalai G', 'Wang X', 'Wang Y', 'Watson DK', 'Leonard WJ', 'Blobel GA', 'Poncz M']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, ARC 316H, 3165 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['P01 HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58044/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA78582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Liver/embryology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52499-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-04-019760 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Oct 1;108(7):2198-206. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-04-019760.

PML-enforced RARA homodimerization allows the tighter binding of corepressors, silencing RARA target genes. In addition, homodimerization dramatically extends the spectrum of DNA-binding sites of the fusion protein compared with those of normal RARA. Yet, any contribution of these two properties of PML/RARA to differentiation arrest and immortalization of primary mouse hematopoietic progenitors was unknown. We demonstrate that dimerization-induced silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT)-enhanced binding and relaxed DNA-binding site specificity are both required for efficient immortalization. Thus, enforced RARA dimerization is critical not only for triggering transcriptional repression but also for extending the repertoire of target genes.

To identify the target antigens associated with tumor rejection, we used SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning) to screen ATL complementary DNA expression libraries with sera from an ATL patient who had a GVL response after allo-HSCT. Among the isolated clones, autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), which encodes a glycosylated transmembrane protein, was found to have selective reactivity with the sera obtained during tumor regression. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for AMFR showed highest expression in the testis among normal tissues. Furthermore, aberrant AMFR expression was found in at least some ATL patients.

FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), together with KIT, FMS, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, is a class III RTK. FLT3 mutations were first reported as internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence; subsequently, a missense point mutation at the D835 residue and point mutations, deletions, and insertions in the codons surrounding D835 within a FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3/KDMs) have been found. FLT3 mutations are the most frequent genetic alterations so far reported in acute myeloid leukemia and are involved in the signaling pathway of autonomous proliferation and differentiation block in leukemia cells. Several large-scale studies have confirmed that FLT3/ITD is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. Therefore, routine screening for FLT3 mutations is recommended to stratify patients into distinct risk groups. However, because high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation cannot overcome the adverse effects of FLT3 mutations, the development of FLT3 kinase inhibitors is expected to produce a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for leukemia therapy.","['Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. kiyoi@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukocytosis/enzymology/genetics/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['F12074G00Q689046 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.06071 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2006 May;83(4):301-8. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.06071.,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses, imatinib has moved toward first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. However, the emergence of resistance to imatinib remains a major problem in the treatment of Ph-positive leukemia. Several mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been identified, including BCR-ABL gene amplification that leads to overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein, point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding, and point mutations outside of the kinase domain that allosterically inhibit imatinib binding to BCR-ABL. The need for alternative or additional treatment for imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive leukemia has guided the way to the design of a second generation of targeted therapies, which has resulted mainly in the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors such as AMN107, dasatinib, NS-187, and ON012380. The major goal of these efforts is to create new compounds that are more potent than imatinib and/or more effective against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones.

We prepared the gum C-glycosylated derivative (GG), and its sulphated derivative (SGG), aiming to characterize their cancer chemopreventive, and anti-inflammatory properties. Estimation of cancer chemopreventive activity, specifically anti-initiation, including the modulation of carcinogen metabolism and the antioxidant capacity, revealed that GG was a potent anti-initiator, where it inhibited not only the carcinogen activator enzyme, cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), but also induced the carcinogen detoxification enzymes glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), while SGG inhibited both CYP1A and GSTs. SGG was an effective radical scavenger than GG against hydroxyl, peroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals. GG and SGG were found to modulate the macrophage functions into an anti-inflammatory pattern. Thus, both enhanced the macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-zymosan; however, they also inhibited strongly the nitric oxide generation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW macrophage 264.7. Unexpectedly, both GG and SGG dramatically inhibited the binding affinity of FITC-LPS to RAW 264.7, as indicated by flow cytometry analysis. GG and SGG exhibited a significant anti-proliferative activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2), and only SGG was specifically cytotoxic for human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7), but neither was significantly cytotoxic for human lymphoblastic leukemia cells (1301). SGG led to a major disturbance in cell cycle phases of Hep G2 cells as indicated by concomitant arrest in S- and G2/M-phases, a disturbance that was associated with an induced cell death as a result of necrosis, but not apoptosis in both GG- and SGG-treated cells. Taken together, the modified gums could be used as an alternative of G in health food industries to provide cancer prevention in risk populations.","['Gamal-Eldeen, Amira M', 'Amer, Hassan', 'Helmy, Wafaa A']","['Gamal-Eldeen AM', 'Amer H', 'Helmy WA']","['Cancer Biology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Division of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Research Centre, Dokki 12622, Cairo, Egypt. aeldeen@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Galactans)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Plant Gums)', 'E89I1637KE (guar gum)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Galactans/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mannans/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Plant Gums']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/09/16 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(06)00073-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2006.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2006 Jul 10;161(3):229-40. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.03.010.

DESIGN: A descriptive analysis. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, during the period from August 1997 to August 2005. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia treated as outpatient in haematology clinic, or admitted in haem-oncology wards in The Aga Khan University Hospital were included. Records were retrospectively analyzed for clinicopathologic features. Risk groups were assigned as per Sokal scoring. RESULTS: During the 8 years study period, 245 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed, the median age of presentation was 35 years (range 11-73); with male to female ratio 1.69:1. At the time of diagnosis, 178 patients (72.6%), 48 (19.7%) and 17 (7.8%) of patients were in chronic, accelerated and blast phase of the disease respectively. Abdominal fullness was the frequent clinical presentation followed by fever. Laboratory parameters revealed mean hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl (range 4.6-15), mean total leukocyte count 168 x 10(9)/L (35-959) and mean platelets 408 x 10(9)/L (range 30-2335). The mean size of spleen at the time of presentation was 9.2 cm below the left subcostal margin. A large number of patients (46.2%) were in high risk group according to Sokal score i.e. > 1.2.

This has lead to the discovery of a novel class of alternative entities called large-scale copy number variations (CNVs). These CNVs are often found in regions of closely linked sequence homology called duplicons that are thought to facilitate genomic rearrangements in some classes of neoplasia. Recently, it was proposed that duplicons located near the recurrent translocation break points on chromosomes 9 and 22 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may facilitate this tumor-specific translocation. Furthermore, approximately 15-20% of CML patients also carry a microdeletion on the derivative 9 chromosome (der(9)) and these patients have a poor prognosis. It has been hypothesised that der(9) deletion patients have increased levels of chromosomal instability. RESULTS: In this study aCGH was performed and identified a CNV (RP11-125A5, hereafter called CNV14q12) that was present as a genomic gain or loss in 10% of control DNA samples derived from cytogenetically normal individuals. CNV14q12 was the same clone identified by Iafrate et al. as a CNV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to determine the relative frequency of this CNV in DNA from a series of 16 CML patients (both with and without a der(9) deletion) together with DNA derived from 36 paediatric solid tumors in comparison to the incidence of CNV in control DNA. CNV14q12 was present in approximately 50% of both tumor and CML DNA, but was found in 72% of CML bearing a der(9) microdeletion. Chi square analysis found a statistically significant difference (p <or= 0.001) between the incidence of this CNV in cancer and normal DNA and a slightly increased incidence in CML with deletions in comparison to those CML without a detectable deletion. CONCLUSION: The increased incidence of CNV14q12 in tumor samples suggests that either acquired or inherited genomic variation of this new class of variation may be associated with onset or progression of neoplasia.","['Braude, Ilan', 'Vukovic, Bisera', 'Prasad, Mona', 'Marrano, Paula', 'Turley, Stefanie', 'Barber, Dwayne', 'Zielenska, Maria', 'Squire, Jeremy A']","['Braude I', 'Vukovic B', 'Prasad M', 'Marrano P', 'Turley S', 'Barber D', 'Zielenska M', 'Squire JA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ilanbraude@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', 'Gene Duplication', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/methods', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-7-138 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-7-138 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2006 Jun 6;7:138. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-7-138.,,20060606,,,PMC1550726,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.","['Shilatifard, Ali']",['Shilatifard A'],"['Saint Louis University School of Medicine and the Saint Louis University Cancer Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA. shilatia@slu.edu']",,['eng'],"['2R01CA089455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM069905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Biochem,Annual review of biochemistry,2985150R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Set2 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'X Chromosome Inactivation']",2006/06/08 09:00,2007/02/06 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142422 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Biochem. 2006;75:243-69. doi: 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142422.,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that study, we also explored the modulatory effects and molecular mechanisms of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on the cytotoxicity of luteolin to HL-60 cells. In this study, we found that PDTC was able to inhibit luteolin-induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. When HL-60 cells were treated with PDTC for 0.5 h before 60 microM luteolin treatment, the DNA ladder disappeared. Moreover, flow cytometry showed that PDTC had dose dependently decreased the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells and had not interfered with luteolin's ability to change the mitochondrial membrane potential or its ability to trigger the release of cytochrome c to cytosol. Detection by Western blotting, however, did show that PDTC had interfered with luteolin's ability to cleave poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and DNA fragmentation of factor-45. Three hours after the PDTC-pretreated HL-60 cells were treated with 60 microM luteolin, the product cleaved from Akt started to appear. Therefore, not only was PDTC able to stop the apoptosis of HL-60 cells treated with luteolin, it was also found to increase phosphorylation of Akt and caspase-9. These results suggest that in the luteolin-induced apoptotic pathway, phosphorylation of procaspase-9 by survival signals might play an important role in the ultimate fate of HL-60 cells.","['Cheng, An-Chin', 'Huang, Tzou-Chi', 'Lai, Ching-Shu', 'Kuo, Jen-Min', 'Huang, Ying-Tang', 'Lo, Chih-Yu', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Cheng AC', 'Huang TC', 'Lai CS', 'Kuo JM', 'Huang YT', 'Lo CY', 'Ho CT', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Physical Therapy, Shu-Zen College of Medicine and Management, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Luteolin/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/*pharmacology']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/08/09 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf060269n [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2006 Jun 14;54(12):4215-21. doi: 10.1021/jf060269n.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of nm23-H1 mRNA were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction after transfection for 24 hours. The expression levels of nm23-H1 protein were assayed by immunocytochemical method after transfection for 48 hours. And after transfection for 24, 48 and 72 hours, cell proliferation was determined by MTT method. Among the three siRNAs, siNM526 can effectively inhibit the expression of nm23-H1 on mRNA and protein levels. The growth of K562 cells was suppressed after transfection of siNM526.

BCR-ABL encodes a constitutively active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is required and sufficient for cellular transformation. Bcr-Abl is, therefore, an ideal target for pharmacotherapy. Imatinib Mesylate (Glivec) is a specific inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase. Imatinib shows high efficiency and low toxicity in treatment of CML patients. The main problem of imatinib treatment is the development of resistance. The mechanisms of resistance can be divided into two groups. The first group is characterized by reactivation of Bcr-Abl kinase in spite of continual imatinib presence. This can be caused by BCR-ABL amplification, overexpression or mutation in Abl kinase domain. Imatinib might not even reach the target Bcr-Abl protein (possible causes: drug efflux or imatinib binding to alpha1-acid glycoprotein). In the second group of resistance mechanisms, the Bcr-Abl kinase is inhibited but the resistance is maintained by other signal transducers (e.g. Src kinases). Standard cytogenetics as well as assay evaluating the phosphorylation status of Bcr-Abl substrate and/or sequencing of Abl kinase transcript can be used to test the mechanism of resistance. Treatment of patients can be re-evaluated on the basis of the status of IM resistance.","['Nausova, J', 'Priwitzerova, M', 'Jarosova, M', 'Indrak, K', 'Faber, E', 'Divoky, V']","['Nausova J', 'Priwitzerova M', 'Jarosova M', 'Indrak K', 'Faber E', 'Divoky V']","['Ustav biologie LF UP, Olomouc. jitkanausova@olomouc.cz']",,['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/06/08 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2006/06/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(5):377-82.,,,,,,,,,,,Chronicka myeloidni leukemie--rezistence na imatinib mesylat (Glivec)--prehled literatury a vlastni zkusenosti.,,,

During the Second World War, explosives production factories were built and operated at Drigg and Sellafield, and a shell filling factory at Bootle, in west Cumbria, England, requiring substantial numbers of construction workers to be brought into this remote and isolated area. Following the design of an earlier study of CL near large (post-war) rural construction sites, mortality from this disease was investigated with the help of the Office of National Statistics, in the area around these Cumbrian factories where local workers largely lived, during the construction period and with particular reference to the overlapping construction and operational phase when the mixing of local and migrant workers would have been greatest. An excess of leukaemia deaths at ages 1-14 was found during the construction period (observed 3; observed/expected (O/E) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6, 6.0), which was more marked and statistically significant during the overlap with operations (O 3; O/E 4.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 12.2), especially at ages 1-4 (O 2; O/E 7.1, CI: 1.2, 23.6). A previous investigation did not detect this excess because it considered only a small part of west Cumbria that omitted the communities where most of the workforce lived, having incorrectly attributed the post-war expansion of the village of Seascale (situated between Drigg and Sellafield) to the wartime ordnance factories. The present findings are consistent with the results of the earlier study of rural construction projects and with the general evidence that marked rural-urban population mixing increases the risk of CL.","['Kinlen, L']",['Kinlen L'],"['Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Roosevelt Drive, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK. leo.kinlen@dphpc.ox.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Explosive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chemical Industry/*history', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Explosive Agents/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*history', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*history', 'Occupational Exposure/*history', 'Risk Factors', 'World War II']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['6603199 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6603199 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2006 Jul 3;95(1):102-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603199.

Exploring the potential of allogeneic transplantation to eradicate disease has therefore been of interest for some time. This review reports on recent developments in this field to evaluate the current status of stem cell transplantation in the management of these conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent studies examine the application of reduced intensity regimens in follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Interest is particularly focused on assessing the potency of the allogeneic graft-versus-malignancy effect, whether achieved by T cells infused at the time of transplant, or by the administration of exogenous donor lymphocytes at relapse or progression following transplant. Furthermore, the discovery of molecular/genetic factors that permit identification of patients with poor prognosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia has led to interest in identifying whether the allogeneic effect can overcome the impact of these factors. SUMMARY: Encouraging evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of reduced intensity transplantation in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. Allogeneic graft-versus-malignancy effects can be demonstrated and durable responses to donor lymphocytes are being reported. More follow-up is required, however, before the curative potential of allogeneic transplantation can be assessed. The appropriate timing of transplant and the choice of regimen remains unclear.","['Thomson, K J', 'Mackinnon, S']","['Thomson KJ', 'Mackinnon S']","['Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, UK. kirsty.thomson@uclh.org']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blood Donors', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.moh.0000231426.23278.32 [doi]', '00062752-200607000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2006 Jul;13(4):273-9. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000231426.23278.32.,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews older prognostic factors such as beta2-microglobulin and thymidine kinase activity that have been partially validated by recently completed large studies. New prognostic factors such as interphase cytogenetics, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutational analysis, and relevant secondary surrogate markers of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, including methylation of the zeta-associated protein gene, lipoprotein lipase overexpression, telomere length, and telomerase activity are reviewed. Some prognostic factors (interphase cytogenetics) but not others (immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutational status, zeta-associated protein expression) predict the duration of response to fludarabine-based combination strategies.

This has mainly been achieved empirically through carefully controlled, randomized clinical trials. Due to relative nonspecific action and narrow therapeutic indices of antileukemic medications, however, current therapy can be associated with significant short and long-term adverse effects, and around 20% of patients will not be cured despite intensified treatment. Pharmacogenomics, which studies the role of inheritance in individual variation in drug disposition and response, could be a useful tool to further improve outcome in this heterogeneous disease by individualization of therapy based on information gained from the genetic 'make-up' of normal host cells and lymphoblastic leukemia cells. RECENT FINDINGS: The focus of this review is on recent progress in the field by discussing the results of selected studies in which information from functional genomics, high-throughput molecular analyses, and pharmacodynamics has been integrated to establish pharmacogenomic models. These models may be used to both maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity of existing antileukemic medications, or to identify novel therapeutic targets in lymphoblasts that are resistant to conventional antileukemic drugs. SUMMARY: The findings from recent pharmacogenomic studies can be integrated into decision-making in future clinical trials.

Epstein-Barr virus is associated with B-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed patients as well as some cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, some T and natural killer lymphomas and approximately 40% of cases of Hodgkin's disease. Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 and human herpes virus 8 genomes are also found in tumor cells in some types of lymphoma, while there are epidemiological data linking hepatitis C and lymphoma. The presence of the viral genome in all these malignancies offers the prospect for therapeutic interventions targeting virus-encoded proteins. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunotherapy with antigen-specific T cells has efficacy in immunosuppressed patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated posttransplant lymphoma and in some patients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive Hodgkin's disease. Preclinical studies are focusing on agents that block Epstein-Barr virus-encoded proteins or induce lytic cycle agents. In hepatitis C virus-positive lymphomas, responses have been reported with immune modulation. Increasing knowledge of cellular pathways modulated by viruses provides additional potential targets for therapy. SUMMARY: While the contribution to oncogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus in B-cell lymphoproliferative disease arising in immunosuppressed patients is clear cut, its role and that of other viruses in lymphomagenesis is less clear in lymphomas developing in immunocompetent patients. The presence of viral genomes in these lymphomas, however, offers targets for intervention and approaches under evaluation include adoptive immunotherapy, interferon, and small molecules targeting aspects of virus biology.","['Ahmed, Nabil', 'Heslop, Helen E']","['Ahmed N', 'Heslop HE']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA94237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00188/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*immunology', 'Genome, Viral/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy/virology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/therapy']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.moh.0000231423.38525.fe [doi]', '00062752-200607000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2006 Jul;13(4):254-9. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000231423.38525.fe.,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many mutations favor active kinase conformations that preclude imatinib binding. Because the active forms of ABL and SRC resemble one another, we tested two dual SRC-ABL kinase inhibitors, AP23464 and PD166326, against 58 imatinib-resistant (IM(R)) BCR/ABL kinase variants. Both compounds potently inhibit most IM(R) variants, and in vitro drug selection demonstrates that active (AP23464) and open (PD166326) conformation-specific compounds are less susceptible to resistance than imatinib. Combinations of inhibitors suppressed essentially all resistance mutations, with the notable exception of T315I. Guided by mutagenesis studies and molecular modeling, we designed a series of AP23464 analogues to target T315I. The analogue AP23846 inhibited both native and T315I variants of BCR/ABL with submicromolar potency but showed nonspecific cellular toxicity. Our data illustrate how conformational dynamics of the ABL kinase accounts for the activity of dual SRC-ABL inhibitors against IM(R)-mutants and provides a rationale for combining conformation specific inhibitors to suppress resistance.","['Azam, Mohammad', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Metcalf, Chester A 3rd', 'Bohacek, Regine S', 'Wang, Yihan', 'Sundaramoorthi, Raji', 'Sliz, Piotr', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Dalgarno, David C', 'Sawyer, Tomi K', 'Daley, George Q']","['Azam M', 'Nardi V', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Metcalf CA 3rd', 'Bohacek RS', 'Wang Y', 'Sundaramoorthi R', 'Sliz P', 'Veach DR', 'Bornmann WG', 'Clarkson B', 'Dalgarno DC', 'Sawyer TK', 'Daley GQ']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AP23464)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/09/12 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['0600001103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0600001103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 13;103(24):9244-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0600001103.

Exposure of leukemia cells to cannabidiol led to cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2)-mediated reduction in cell viability and induction in apoptosis. Furthermore, cannabidiol treatment led to a significant decrease in tumor burden and an increase in apoptotic tumors in vivo. From a mechanistic standpoint, cannabidiol exposure resulted in activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and a decrease in full-length Bid, suggesting possible cross-talk between the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The role of the mitochondria was further suggested as exposure to cannabidiol led to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. It is noteworthy that cannabidiol exposure led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as an increase in the expression of the NAD(P)H oxidases Nox4 and p22(phox). Furthermore, cannabidiol-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels could be blocked by treatment with the ROS scavengers or the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors. Finally, cannabidiol exposure led to a decrease in the levels of p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which could be blocked by treatment with a CB2-selective antagonist or ROS scavenger. Together, the results from this study reveal that cannabidiol, acting through CB2 and regulation of Nox4 and p22(phox) expression, may be a novel and highly selective treatment for leukemia.","['McKallip, Robert J', 'Jia, Wentao', 'Schlomer, Jerome', 'Warren, James W', 'Nagarkatti, Prakash S', 'Nagarkatti, Mitzi']","['McKallip RJ', 'Jia W', 'Schlomer J', 'Warren JW', 'Nagarkatti PS', 'Nagarkatti M']","[""Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, 6439 Garner's Ferry Road, Columbia, SC 29209, USA. rmckallip@gw.med.sc.edu""]",,['eng'],"['K12-DA14041/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-DA05274/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DA016545/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-DA014885/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '19GBJ60SN5 (Cannabidiol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX4 protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cannabidiol/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 4', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.106.023937 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.106.023937 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Sep;70(3):897-908. doi: 10.1124/mol.106.023937.

Progressive increase of p16INK4a (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4A) expression has been shown to correlate with keratinocyte clonal evolution. Thus, the aim of our study is to understand whether p16INK4a accumulation is a triggering mechanism of epidermal clonal evolution or a secondary event. We show that inactivation of p16INK4a, by an antisense strategy, allows primary human keratinocytes to escape replicative senescence. Specifically, p16INK4a inactivation alone blocks clonal evolution and maintains keratinocytes in the stem cell compartment. Antisense excision is followed by keratinocyte senescence, confirming that persistent p16INK4a inactivation is required for maintenance of clonal evolution block. Immortalization is accompanied by resumption of B-Cell Specific Moloney murine leukemia virus site 1 (Bmi-1) expression and telomerase activity, hallmarks of tissue regenerative capacity. In turn, Bmi-1 expression is necessary to maintain the impairment of clonal evolution induced by p16INK4a inactivation. Finally, p16INK4a down-regulation in transient amplifying keratinocytes does not affect clonal evolution, and cells undergo senescence. Thus, p16INK4a inactivation appears to selectively prevent clonal conversion in cells endowed with a high proliferative potential. These data indicate that p16INK4a regulates keratinocyte clonal evolution and that inactivation of p16INK4a in epidermal stem cells is necessary for maintaining stemness.","['Maurelli, Riccardo', 'Zambruno, Giovanna', 'Guerra, Liliana', 'Abbruzzese, Claudia', 'Dimri, Goberdhan', 'Gellini, Mara', 'Bondanza, Sergio', 'Dellambra, Elena']","['Maurelli R', 'Zambruno G', 'Guerra L', 'Abbruzzese C', 'Dimri G', 'Gellini M', 'Bondanza S', 'Dellambra E']","[""Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Cutaneous Physiopathology, I.D.I.-IRCCS, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, Via dei Castelli Romani, 83/85, Pomezia (Roma), 00040 Italy. e.dellambra@idi.it""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology/virology', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regeneration', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.05-4480fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.05-4480fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2006 Jul;20(9):1516-8. doi: 10.1096/fj.05-4480fje.

Between November 1997 and June 2003, 171 cases and 410 controls matched for age and sex were recruited. Since assessment of petrochemical impacts depends on accurate exposure estimates, the authors developed a procedure using geographic information system tools to assign subjects' exposure. The resulting individual-level exposure estimates (the exposure opportunity score) are an integrated exposure measure that accounts for subjects' mobility, length of stay at each residence, distance to petrochemical plant(s), monthly prevailing wind direction, and multiple petrochemical pollution sources. Different conditional logistic regression models were fitted for subjects aged 0-19 and 20-29 years to evaluate separately childhood versus adulthood leukemia. No overall association was observed for the younger age group. However, residential petrochemical exposure was a significant risk factor for leukemia for the older age group. For one unit of increase in the log-transformed exposure opportunity score, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.54 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.14, 2.09). This study illustrates the utility of geographic information system tools for providing refined exposure estimates for residential exposure to petrochemical pollution.","['Yu, Chu-Ling', 'Wang, Su-Fen', 'Pan, Pi-Chen', 'Wu, Ming-Tsang', 'Ho, Chi-Kung', 'Smith, Thomas J', 'Li, Yi', 'Pothier, Lucille', 'Christiani, David C']","['Yu CL', 'Wang SF', 'Pan PC', 'Wu MT', 'Ho CK', 'Smith TJ', 'Li Y', 'Pothier L', 'Christiani DC']","['Occupational Health Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['Kaohsiung Leukemia Research Group'],['eng'],"['ES00002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09723/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Petroleum)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemical Industry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', '*Geographic Information Systems', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Population Dynamics', 'Risk', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Wind']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwj182 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwj182 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2006 Aug 1;164(3):200-7. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwj182.

METHODS: The study groups were 31 paediatric patients with ALL and 18 healthy controls. All subjects were vaccinated with TT and a protein conjugated Hib vaccine. Antibody levels were analysed at three time points: At diagnosis of ALL, after cessation of treatment before vaccination and three weeks after vaccination. Avidity was measured twice, with a thiocyanate elution assay, at diagnosis of ALL and three weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: There was a correlation between level and avidity of tetanus antibodies after vaccination (r(s) = 0.59, P < 0.001). In the standard-risk and intermediate-risk ALL groups, all patients responded with protective levels of tetanus antibodies with normal avidity. In the high-risk ALL group 7/9 patients had subprotective levels of tetanus antibodies after vaccination and concomitantly the lowest avidity, implying poor protection against tetanus. No patients were found with low levels and low avidity of anti-Hib IgG, and 29/31 patients had full protection after a single dose of conjugated Hib-vaccine. CONCLUSION: The vaccination strategy after childhood ALL must be different for low-risk and high-risk ALL groups, since the high-risk group fail to elicit a recall response to tetanus.","['Ek, Torben', 'Mellander, Lotta', 'Hahn-Zoric, Mirjana', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas']","['Ek T', 'Mellander L', 'Hahn-Zoric M', 'Abrahamsson J']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Goteborg University, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. torben.ek@medfak.gu.se""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Haemophilus Vaccines)', '0 (Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*immunology', '*Antibody Affinity', 'Bacterial Capsules', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/*immunology', 'Haemophilus influenzae/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/*immunology']",2006/06/07 09:00,2007/04/07 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['G308475222N8731P [pii]', '10.1080/08035250500459717 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2006 Jun;95(6):701-6. doi: 10.1080/08035250500459717.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that blast cells in a group of patients with AML produce and secrete the mitogenic enzyme tryptase. In the present study, we examined functional effects of tryptase in the context of AML. As assessed by 3H-thymidine uptake experiments, tryptase-containing serum from patients with AML as well as heparin-complexed recombinant tryptase were found to promote the proliferation of cultured bone marrow- and lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. A neutralizing antibody against human beta-tryptase was found to diminish these growth-stimulatory effects of serum-tryptase in all patients examined. Tryptase also induced the expression of mRNA for GM-CSF and SCF, two cytokines known to promote growth of AML cells, in cultured bone marrow fibroblasts. Neither recombinant tryptase nor tryptase-rich serum of AML patients, showed an effect on the growth of leukemic blast cells irrespective of the FAB category or expression of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2, a putative molecular target of tryptase. Together, tryptase is secreted from AML blasts as a biologically active molecule that may exhibit paracrine rather than autocrine effects in AML.","['Sonneck, Karoline', 'Florian, Stefan', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Kondo, Rudin', 'Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Aichberger, Karl J', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Schwartz, Lawrence B', 'Valent, Peter']","['Sonneck K', 'Florian S', 'Bohm A', 'Krauth MT', 'Kondo R', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Gleixner KV', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Derdak S', 'Pickl WF', 'Sperr WR', 'Schwartz LB', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology - the Center of Excellence for Clinical and Experimental Oncology (CLEXO), Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],['AI20487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*enzymology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tritium/pharmacokinetics', 'Tryptases']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['H88R12WX06283868 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500513652 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 May;47(5):897-906. doi: 10.1080/10428190500513652.,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 May;47(5):789-90.

Angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptors are present on the CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Angiotensin II stimulates the proliferation of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood hematopoietic progenitors. There are preliminary data that local RAS might also be involved in leukemogenesis. ACE hyper-function may lead to the acceleration of negative hematopoietic regulator peptide, AcSDKP, metabolism, which in turn lowers its level in the bone marrow micro-environment, finally removing the anti-proliferative effect of AcSDKP on the hematopoietic cells and blasts. Renin expression could have a role on the leukemia development and angiotensin may act as an autocrine growth factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The aim of this study is to search ACE (CD 143) surface antigen by flow-cytometric analyses on the leukemic blast cells taken from the bone marrow of the patients with AML. Bone marrow aspiration materials and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 11 patients with AML (eight males, three females; aged 46 (range 26-67) years) and six patients with non-malignant hematological disorders (four males, two females; aged 56 (range 22-71) years). ACE (CD 143) surface antigen was shown to be over-expressed in leukemic myeloid blast cells. ACE is positively correlated with bone marrow blast count. Elucidation of the pathological activity of the local RAS-mediated regulation of the leukemogenesis is both pathobiologically and clinically important, since the angiotensin peptides represent a molecular target in the disease management.","['Aksu, Salih', 'Beyazit, Yavuz', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Canpinar, Hande', 'Kekilli, Murat', 'Uner, Aysegul', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Ozcebe, Osman I']","['Aksu S', 'Beyazit Y', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Canpinar H', 'Kekilli M', 'Uner A', 'Sayinalp N', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Goker H', 'Ozcebe OI']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. saksu@hacettepe.edu.tr']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics', '*Renin-Angiotensin System']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['T3K042758K12M043 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500399250 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 May;47(5):891-6. doi: 10.1080/10428190500399250.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, on the basis of morphological and immunological features, the patient was diagnosed as being affected by CD34 + /CD13 + /CD33 + /HLA-DR + /CD7 + FAB-M2 AML, along with a B-CLL characterized by neoplastic cells expressing a VH3-53/D3-22/JH4 Ig, bearing, on average, 3.9% IgVH mutations without evidence of antigen-driven selection. To establish whether the two neoplastic cell populations shared some common molecular signature, we performed IgH gene rearrangement studies on CD34 + /CD19- and CD34-/CD19 + immunomagnetically sorted cell populations: only genomic DNA from the CD19 + /CD34- cell fraction revealed the presence of the IgH gene rearrangement.

In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), TLS frequency, risk stratification, monitoring, and management strategies are based largely on case series and data from other malignancies. A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted to estimate TLS incidence and identify TLS predictive factors in a patient population undergoing myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy. This study included 194 patients, aged 18-86 years, with AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing primary myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy. Nineteen patients (9.8%) developed TLS. In univariate analysis, elevated pre-chemotherapy values for uric acid (P < 0.0001), creatinine (P = 0.0025), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.0001), white blood cell (P = 0.0058), gender (P = 0.0064) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia history (P = 0.0292) were significant predictors.

Patients with CLL/SLL who presented at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center over a 2-year period and had available marrow paraffin blocks were studied for evidence of EBV infection using a highly specific in-situ hybridization assay for detection of EBV encoded RNA (EBERs). Results were analysed in relation to other presenting characteristics and outcome. Thirty-two patients were examined. EBERs were detected in the bone marrow of 12 of 32 (38%) CLL/SLL marrows vs 0 of 20 normal marrows (p = 0.002). EBERs were observed in sporadic granulocytes alone or in addition to its presence in lymphocytes in nine of the 12 EBV-positive patients. EBERs were detected less frequently in patients with Rai stage 0 - 1 disease (20%) compared with Rai stage 2 - 4 (66%; p = 0.008). EBER-positive patients tended to have higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p = 0.053). The 10-year survival rate was 22% vs 58% for patients with and without discernible EBERs (log-rank, p = 0.08). Evidence of EBV infection was found in 38% of patients with CLL/SLL. Despite the small number of patients tested, discernable EBERs were significantly more common in individuals with more advanced Rai stage and there was a trend toward shorter survival in patients in whom EBV EBERs were discerned.

However, the identification of prognostic markers predictive of durable remission remains an important aspect in risk-adjusted treatment algorithms. High presentation leucocyte count has been found to correlate with inferior disease-free-survival (DFS). However, recent studies have also shown aberrant promoter methylation of the CDKN2B (alias p15) gene to be a negative prognostic factor. Promoter methylation results in the formation of a repressor complex, leading to chromatin compaction and suppression of gene expression and is, therefore, an alternative mechanism of gene inactivation. CDKN2B, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a tumor suppressor gene inhibiting cell cycle progression. The CpG island inside the CDKN2B promoter is hyper-methylated in approximately 50 - 60% of APL patients. CDKN2B methylation correlates negatively with DFS. As methylation-induced inactivation of CDKN2B pre-disposes to unchecked cellular proliferation, CDKN2B hyper-methylation is also associated with high presentation leucocyte count. Multivariate analysis in several studies, however, has shown that the negative prognostic impact of CDKN2B methylation is independent of its association with high leucocyte counts. Therefore, CDKN2B methylation is a potential prognostic factor that may be incorporated into a risk-stratified therapeutic strategy, which aims at achieving a cure with optimal amounts of treatment.","['Chim, Chor-Sang', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Chim CS', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PR China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Risk Assessment']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['G177W65778260171 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500513827 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 May;47(5):815-25. doi: 10.1080/10428190500513827.,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variability appears to arise from complex molecular alterations identified in malignant cells from patient subsets. Recent studies have focused in particular on identifying new molecular markers to help predict the most effective and adapted treatments. In addition to the mutation status of immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain region (IgVH) genes, which is a well-established predictive factor in B-CLL, these new markers include defects of cell factors involved in the maintenance of genome stability, such as telomere function, DNA repair, ATM and p53. Other predictive factors, such as tyrosine kinase Zap-70 and soluble factors found in patient sera, may be associated with B-cell receptor signal transduction. Interestingly, an alteration of these factors fits closely, though not strikingly, with the absence of somatic mutations in IgVH genes, suggesting that the latter may be due either to epigenetic events leading to an unstable genome or to an inherited defect in the immune response of malignant B-cells. Recent lessons from Zap-70 expression/phosphorylation suggest that some of these markers may reflect the defective pathways in B-CLL cells rather than being markers of cell malignancy per se. Furthermore, specific subsets of markers are found in patient cells resistant to treatment. Current studies on gene expression profiling and proteomic analyses should soon lead to a better understanding of how these pathways are affected, especially in multi-drug resistant B-CLL.","['Bouley, Julien', 'Deriano, Ludovic', 'Delic, Jozo', 'Merle-Beral, Helene']","['Bouley J', 'Deriano L', 'Delic J', 'Merle-Beral H']","['Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et Oncologie, CEA, DSV-DRR, Fontenay aux Roses, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genomic Instability/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/05 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['L8H23P786X74LH24 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500513835 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 May;47(5):791-801. doi: 10.1080/10428190500513835.,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 8 multi-institutional trials performed by Cancer and Leukemia Group B were combined. Eligible patients had progressive adenocarcinoma of the prostate after androgen ablation, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function. The proportional hazards model stratified by study was used to assess the prognostic importance of age for predicting clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1,194 men 132 (11%) were 50 to 60 years old and 120 (10%) were 80 to 89 years old. Median survival was 12.2 months (95% CI 10.6 to 13.8) in men 50 to 59 years old, 15.9 months (95% CI 14.2 to 17.6) in men 60 to 69 years old, 15.6 months (95% CI 13.8 to 16.9) in men 70 to 79 years old and 8.9 months (95% CI 6.6 to 12.1) in men 80 to 89 years old. Compared to 70 to 79-year-old men the HR for death in octogenarians was 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6, p = 0.015). Furthermore, the HR for prostate cancer death in octogenarians was 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, p = 0.010) and in 50 to 59-year-old men it was 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6, p = 0.042) compared to men 70 to 79 years old. Black men were at lower risk for death than white men (HR 0.77, 95 CI% 0.65 to 0.92, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians and white men are at increased risk for death compared to other men with hormone refractory prostate cancer.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Ou, San-San', 'Kelly, Wm Kevin', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Ou SS', 'Kelly WK', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, 2424 Erwin Road, Durham, NC 27705, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",,['eng'],"['CA 02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*mortality', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Androgen Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Whites']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5347(06)00566-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0022-5347(06)00566-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2006 Jul;176(1):81-6. doi: 10.1016/S0022-5347(06)00566-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pedigrees studies on families with multiple affected members have supported the hypothesis of a contributing hereditary etiology of MM due to shared genetic factors. The aim of our study was twofold: 1) to assess incidence trends of MM over the period 1961-2003 using national cancer registry data and; 2) to quantify the familial risk of MM using the 2004 update of the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. For men, the age-standardized rates were 4.33 per 100,000 in 1961-65 and 4.79 in 2001-03. The corresponding rates for women were 2.76 and 3.43. In the elderly, MM rates have risen from 28.7 per 100,000 to 36.2 in men, and from 20.2 to 24.5 in women. MM clustered in families with MM (standardized incidence ratio, SIR=2.45), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR=1.34) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SIR=2.45). No association was found for Hodgkin lymphoma and other leukaemias. Significant associations were found for rectal, stomach, cervical, prostate, bladder, endocrine glands and connective tissue malignancies. Our study adds further evidence that the incidence of MM in Sweden has been constant for several decades. The apparent increase observed in the elderly is, at least in part, attributable to improved diagnostics and certification. MM aggregates in families with MM, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and, to a lesser extent, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. If environmental factors can be excluded, the pattern of familial risk of MM is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.","['Altieri, Andrea', 'Chen, Bowang', 'Bermejo, Justo Lorenzo', 'Castro, Felipe', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Altieri A', 'Chen B', 'Bermejo JL', 'Castro F', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, DKFZ, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. a.altieri@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Time Factors']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(06)00307-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2005.11.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2006 Jul;42(11):1661-70. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2005.11.033.

However, the interaction between vasculature and adrenal cortex during early organogenesis remains largely unclear. In this study, we focused on the zebrafish counterpart of adrenal cortex, interrenal tissue, to explore the possible role of endothelium in the development of steroidogenic tissues. The ontogeny of interrenal tissue was found to be tightly associated with the endothelial cells (ECs) that constitute the axial vessels. The early interrenal primordia emerge as two clusters of cells that migrate centrally and converge at the midline, whereas the central convergence was abrogated in the avascular cloche (clo) mutant. Neither loss of blood circulation nor perturbations of vessel assembly could account for the interrenal convergence defect, implying a role of endothelial signaling prior to the formation of axial blood vessels. Moreover, as the absence of trunk endothelium in clo mutant was rescued by the forced expression of SCL, the interrenal fusion defect could be alleviated. We thus conclude that endothelial signaling is involved in the morphogenetic movement of early interrenal tissue.","['Liu, Yi-Wen', 'Guo, Lin']","['Liu YW', 'Guo L']","['Department of Life Science, Tunghai University, Taichung 40704, Taiwan R.O.C. dlslys@thu.edu.tw']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (nr5a1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Movement', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Endothelium/*embryology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Kidney/blood supply/cytology/*embryology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Renal Circulation', 'Steroids/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Zebrafish/*embryology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(06)00762-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.464 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2006 Sep 1;297(1):44-58. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.464.

Modern flow cytometers enable researchers to reliably measure six and more variables, describing cellular size, granularity and expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins, for thousands of cells per second. Currently, analysis of cytometry readouts relies on visual inspection and manual gating of one- or two-dimensional projections of the data. This procedure, however, is labor-intensive and misses potential characteristic patterns in higher dimensions. RESULTS: Leukemic samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at initial diagnosis and during induction therapy have been investigated by 4-color flow cytometry. We have utilized multivariate classification techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM), to automate leukemic cell detection in cytometry. Classifiers were built on conventionally diagnosed training data. We assessed the detection accuracy on independent test data and analyzed marker expression of incongruently classified cells. SVM classification can recover manually gated leukemic cells with 99.78% sensitivity and 98.87% specificity. CONCLUSION: Multivariate classification techniques allow for automating cell population detection in cytometry readouts for diagnostic purposes. They potentially reduce time, costs and arbitrariness associated with these procedures. Due to their multivariate classification rules, they also allow for the reliable detection of small cell populations.","['Toedling, Joern', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Spang, Rainer']","['Toedling J', 'Rhein P', 'Ratei R', 'Karawajew L', 'Spang R']","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics & Berlin Center for Genome Based Bioinformatics, Ihnestrasse, 73, D-14195 Berlin, Germany. toedling@ebi.ac.uk']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Computers', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Programming Languages', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/06/07 09:00,2006/08/05 09:00,['2006/06/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-282 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-282 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Jun 5;7:282. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-282.,,20060605,,,PMC1501051,,,,,,,,,

We developed an experimental model in which lung cells are deliberately infected with Mycoplasma fermentans. Human lung fibroblasts (HLF) were exposed to live M. fermentans and immune-modulating cytokine release was assessed with and without known inducers of cytokine production. M. fermentans increased IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, MCP-1/CCL2, and Gro-alpha/CXCL1 production. M. fermentans interacted with TNF-beta to release more IL-6, CXCL8, and CXCL1 than predicted by the responses to either stimulus alone. The effects of live infection were recapitulated by exposure to M. fermentans-derived macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2), a Toll-like receptor-2- and receptor-6-specific ligand. The synergistic effect of combined stimuli was more pronounced with prolonged incubations. Preexposure to TNF-beta sensitized the cells to subsequent MALP-2 challenge, but preexposure to MALP-2 did not alter the IL-6 response to TNF-beta. Exposure to M. fermentans or MALP-2 did not enhance nuclear localization, DNA binding, or transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB and did not modulate early NF-kappaB activation in response to TNF-beta. Application of specific inhibitors of various MAPKs suggested that p38 and JNK/stress-activated protein kinase were involved in early IL-6 release after exposure to TNF-beta and M. fermentans, respectively. The combined response to M. fermentans and TNF-beta, however, was uniquely sensitive to delayed application of SP-600125, suggesting that JNK/stress-activated protein kinase contributes to the amplification of IL-6 release. Thus M. fermentans interacts with stimuli such as TNF-beta to amplify lung cell production of immune-modulating cytokines. The mechanisms accounting for this interaction can now be dissected with the use of this in vitro model.","['Fabisiak, James P', 'Gao, Fei', 'Thomson, Robyn G', 'Strieter, Robert M', 'Watkins, Simon C', 'Dauber, James H']","['Fabisiak JP', 'Gao F', 'Thomson RG', 'Strieter RM', 'Watkins SC', 'Dauber JH']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, College of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219-3130, USA. fabs@pitt.edu']",,['eng'],"['R01 ES011986/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES011986-01A3/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-ES-011986/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

We retrospectively compared MRD detection rates and percentages of residual leukemia by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCIP) with results obtained by either flow cytometry DNA (FCDNA) ploidy (n = 14) and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (n = 33) testing for cases with 1.5% or less residual leukemia. A total of 42 paired results were obtained from 20 pediatric patients, including 16 with B lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia and 4 patients with acute myeloid leukemia during the course of induction and/or relapse. Eighty-one percent of the results were concordant (20 negative and 14 positive). There was reasonable correlation coefficients for quantity of residual disease by FCIP and FCDNA ploidy, and poor correlation coefficients for levels of residual disease between FCIP- and FISH-based results. FCIP MRD sensitivity and specificity was 78% and 83%, respectively. Factors contributing to the 19% discordant rate include low sensitivity of the DNA-based methods as applied and antigenic modulation of immunophenotype during the course of treatment. There is a reasonable agreement between the FCIP and FCDNA or FISH methods for detecting and quantifying MRD. However, the methods are viewed as complementary with their own inherent limitations.","['Zwick, David', 'Cooley, Linda', 'Hetherington, Maxine']","['Zwick D', 'Cooley L', 'Hetherington M']","[""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, University of Missouri, Kansas City, 64108, USA.""]",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures/standards', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Ploidies', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/06/06 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2006/06/06 09:00'],"['2006/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['G5J644Q62U030T13 [pii]', '10.1532/LH96.05040 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2006;12(2):75-81. doi: 10.1532/LH96.05040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify potential predictors of relapse and to elucidate the mechanisms of immune control of leukemic blasts we examined the expression of cytokines, costimulatory molecules and members of the TNF family in leukemic marrow samples in a prospective study. Samples from 49 consecutive pediatric patients with B cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (BCP ALL) were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. We identified interleukin (IL)-10 expression as a significant adverse prognostic indicator in childhood BCP-ALL. The event free survival (EFS) of patients expressing IL-10 mRNA in high quantity was significantly lower compared with patients expressing low IL-10 mRNA. Taqman RT-PCR of sorted cell populations showed that IL-10 mRNA was synthetized almost exclusively by NK or T cells. In addition, we found an increased expression of IL-1, IL-4, CD86 and VEGF mRNA in patients with late relapses. Possibly, ALL cells mediate a Th2 shift through increased expression of CD86 and thereby influence the individual relapse risk. These findings emphasize the role of the immune system for the outcome of childhood ALL.","['Stachel, D', 'Albert, M', 'Meilbeck, R', 'Kreutzer, B', 'Haas, R J', 'Schmid, I']","['Stachel D', 'Albert M', 'Meilbeck R', 'Kreutzer B', 'Haas RJ', 'Schmid I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.
