The mechanisms that lead to disease progression remain to be elucidated. To understand the role of aberrant methylation in the progression of CML, DNA methylation patterns in 16 patients with CML blast crisis were analyzed. Methylation status was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) for 13 genes, including cell cycle regulating genes, DNA repair genes, apoptosis-related genes, a differentiation-associated gene and a cytokine signaling gene. The frequency of samples with methylation in each of the following genes were: p15, 18%; MGMT, 12%; RARbeta, 12%; p16, 6%; DAPK, 6% and FHIT, 6%. In total, four (25%) cases showed methylation of at least one gene. None of the 16 cases showed hypermethylation of the hMLH1 or hMSH2 genes. These results suggest that hypermethylation of cell cycle control genes, but not DNA mismatch repair genes, play a significant role in the progression of CML.","['Uehara, Eisuke', 'Takeuchi, Seisho', 'Yang, Yang', 'Fukumoto, Tetsuya', 'Matsuhashi, Yoshiko', 'Tamura, Takahiro', 'Matsushita, Masahide', 'Nagai, Masami', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Tasaka, Taizo']","['Uehara E', 'Takeuchi S', 'Yang Y', 'Fukumoto T', 'Matsuhashi Y', 'Tamura T', 'Matsushita M', 'Nagai M', 'Koeffler HP', 'Tasaka T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa.']",['eng'],['R01 CA026038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20110913,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC3362479,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/06/29 06:01,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2011.419 [doi]', 'ol-03-01-0190 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2012 Jan;3(1):190-192. doi: 10.3892/ol.2011.419.

KBH-A42 was shown to significantly suppress the proliferation of all 14 human cancer cell lines tested. Among these cell lines, the human leukemia cell line K562 was the most sensitive, whereas the UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells were the least sensitive. Additionally, in a human tumor xenograft model using Balb/c nude mice, KBH-A42 was shown to significantly inhibit the growth of K562 tumors, although it only slightly inhibited the growth of UM-UC-3 tumors. The results of flow cytometry analysis and caspase 3/7 activation assays showed that the growth inhibition of K562 cells by KBH-A42 was mediated, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis, but its growth inhibitory effects on UM-UC-3 cells were not mediated by apoptotic induction. In an effort to gain insight into the mechanism by which KBH-A42 inhibits the growth of cancer cells, a microarray analysis was conducted. Four genes were selected from the genes that were down-regulated or up-regulated by KBH-A42 and confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as follows: Harakiri (HRK), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10b (TNFRSF10B), PYD and CARD domain containing protein gene (PYCARD) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (TNFRSF8).

The proliferation of autologous T cells induced by DCs was determined by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake. Maximal T-cell proliferation was observed in co-cultures of DCs fused with liposomal OVCA constructs compared with intact autologous OVCA cells. The combination of autologous and allogeneic liposomal OVCA constructs induced greater T-cell proliferation than either alone. The cytotoxicity of DC-activated T cells against various target cells were analyzed by a (51)Cr-release assay. The combination of autologous and allogeneic liposomal OVCA constructs showed the highest stimulation of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against OVCA cells, but had minimal cytotoxicity against normal fibroblasts or leukemia cells. The liposomal preparations of DC-OVCA were injected monthly into a patient with metastatic ovarian carcinoma whose tumors progressed following multiple courses of chemotherapy. DCs analyzed from the patient post-immunization showed 2- to 3-fold greater OVCA cytotoxicity compared to pre-immunization DCs. Immunoblots using the patient's serum showed reactivity with a number of proteins from ovarian cancer extracts, but not in normal fibroblasts and breast cancer. Following the DC-OVCA treatment, the metastatic lesions progressively decreased in size to the point of being undetectable by serial CAT scans. Seven years following the initial diagnosis, the patient continues to be free of cancer. This report described the anticancer immune reactivity and anti-tumor response induced by DCs sensitized with liposomal constructs of OVCA antigens.

However, silencing of the transgene occurs. Regarding the effects of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) on reactivation of silenced genes, HMAs are considered to be immune enhancers. METHODS: We treated murine WT1- transfected C1498 (mWT1-C1498) with increasing doses of decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA) to analyze their effects on transgene reactivation. RESULTS: DAC and AZA decreased the number of viable cells in a dose- or time-dependent manner. Quantification of WT1 mRNA level was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction after mWT1-C1498 treated with increasing dose of HMA. DAC treatment for 48 h induced 1.4-, 14.6-, and 15.5-fold increment of WT1 mRNA level, compared to untreated sample, at 0.1, 1, and 10microM, respectively. Further increment of WT1 expression in the presence of 1 and 10microM DAC was evident at 72 h. AZA treatment also induced up-regulation of mRNA, but not to the same degree as with DAC treatment. The correlation between the incremental increases in WT1 mRNA by DAC was confirmed by Western blot and concomitant down-regulation of WT1 promoter methylation was revealed. CONCLUSION: The in vitro data show that HMA can induce reactivation of WT1 transgene and that DAC is more effective, at least in mWT1-C1498 cells, which suggests that the combination of DAC and mWT1-C1498 can be used for the development of the experimental model of HMA-combined WT1 immunotherapy targeting leukemia.","['Kwon, Yong-Rim', 'Son, Min-Jung', 'Kim, Hye-Jung', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin']","['Kwon YR', 'Son MJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YJ']","[""Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Transplant Immunology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120430,Korea (South),Immune Netw,Immune network,101137270,PMC3382665,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/06/29 06:01,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4110/in.2012.12.2.58 [doi]'],ppublish,Immune Netw. 2012 Apr;12(2):58-65. doi: 10.4110/in.2012.12.2.58.

Here, we describe a bispecific single-chain Fv (scFv) immunofusion or BIf to target CD123(+) leukemia, that contains an anti-CD123 scFv fused at the N-terminus of human IgG1 hinge-C(H)2-C(H)3, and an anti-CD3 scFv fused at C-terminus. When expressed from transfected CHO-S cells, CD123xCD3 BIf forms a homodimer that provides a structure of N-terminal tumor-targeting domain that closely resembles natural antibody. The CD123xCD3 dimeric structure also provides binding affinity to CD123(+) tumor cells with a Kd of 10(-10) M, one to two orders of magnitude stronger than traditional bispecific antibody constructs. The location of the anti-CD3 scFv at C-terminus of BIf reduces the binding affinity to CD3(+) T cells by two orders, which could help to prevent non-specific T-cell activation. CD123xCD3 BIf is able to achieve T-cell-mediated target cell killing activities at low pM levels with E/T ratios as low as 2. Overall, the inclusion of human IgG1 constant region in BIf construct increases target cell-binding affinity; potentially increases serum half-life by its larger size and FcRn-mediated salvage system; and includes the abilities to activate the additional antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicities.","['Kuo, Shu-Ru', 'Wong, Lucas', 'Liu, Jen-Sing']","['Kuo SR', 'Wong L', 'Liu JS']","['Cancer Research Institute, Scott & White Healthcare, Temple, TX 76502, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,England,Protein Eng Des Sel,"Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS",101186484,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['gzs040 [pii]', '10.1093/protein/gzs040 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Eng Des Sel. 2012 Oct;25(10):561-9. doi: 10.1093/protein/gzs040.

Methods for analyzing data from SRCTs exist but they are either inefficient or suffer from the drawbacks of estimating equation methodology. We describe an estimation procedure, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), which has been fully developed and implemented in point treatment settings, including time to event outcomes, binary outcomes and continuous outcomes. Here we develop and implement TMLE in the SRCT setting. As in the former settings, the TMLE procedure is targeted toward a pre-specified parameter of the distribution of the observed data, and thereby achieves important bias reduction in estimation of that parameter. As with the so-called Augmented Inverse Probability of Censoring Weight (A-IPCW) estimator, TMLE is double-robust and locally efficient.

In the present study, we investigated the novel role of the cGMP/PKG-Ialpha pathway in preventing spontaneous apoptosis, promoting colony formation and regulating phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein and protein expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins in NCI-H460 and A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), which blocks endogenous NO-induced activation of cGMP/PKG-Ialpha, induced apoptosis and decreased colony formation. ODQ also decreased CREB ser133 phosphorylation and protein expression of c-IAP1, livin, and survivin. DT-2 (inhibitor of PKG-Ialpha kinase activity) increased apoptosis by twofold and decreased CREB ser133 phosphorylation and c-IAP1, livin, and survivin expression. Gene knockdown of PKG-Ialpha expression using small-interfering RNA increased apoptosis and decreased CREB ser133 phosphorylation, and c-IAP1, livin, survivin, and Mcl-1 expression. Inhibition of PKG-Ialpha kinase activity with DT-2 dramatically enhanced pro-apoptotic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Combined treatment of DT-2 and cisplatin increased apoptosis compared with cisplatin or DT-2 alone, showing a synergistic effect. The data suggest that the PKG-Ialpha kinase activity is necessary for maintaining higher levels of CREB phosphorylation at ser133 and protein expression of c-IAP1, livin, survivin, and Mcl-1, preventing spontaneous apoptosis and promoting colony formation in NSCLC cells, which may limit the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin.","['Wong, Janica C', 'Bathina, Madhavi', 'Fiscus, Ronald R']","['Wong JC', 'Bathina M', 'Fiscus RR']","['Center for Diabetes and Obesity Prevention, Treatment, Research and Education, and College of Pharmacy, Roseman University of Health Sciences, Henderson, Nevada 89014, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24237 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Nov;113(11):3587-98. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24237.,20130204,10.1002/jcb.24237 [doi],,,"['0 (1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC7 protein, human)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these criteria are insufficient to establish a diagnosis in cases with poor quality bone marrow (BM) samples demonstrating a loss of cellular morphology. We investigated whether the sera of patients contained biomarkers that indicate disease response status. First, we performed multidimensional liquid chromatography-differential gel electrophoresis (MDLC-DIGE) to generate protein profiles of two pooled, paired serum samples from patients who had achieved CR; one collected at diagnosis (PreCR) and the other collected after chemotherapy (CR). Then, with the biomarker candidates found, ELISA was carried out for individual PreCR and CR samples, and for other verification sets including nonremission (NR) patients and normal samples. We selected two proteins, complement factor H (CFH) and apolipoprotein H (ApoH), with dye (Cy) ratios showing greater than 2.0-fold differences between the pooled samples. ELISA showed that CFH and ApoH are useful for distinguishing between the recovered (CR and normal) and nonrecovered (PreCR, PreNR, and NR) states in AML (p <0.001).

Recently, the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) has been associated with increased NRM risk in several retrospective studies, but its clinical utility has never been demonstrated prospectively in an adequately sized cohort. To this aim, we prospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 1937 patients receiving HSCT in Italy over 2 years. HCT-CI was strongly correlated with both 2-year NRM (14.7%, 21.3%, and 27.3% in patients having an HCT-CI score of 0, 1-2, and >/= 3, respectively) and overall survival (56.4%, 54.5%, and 41.3%, respectively). There was an excellent calibration between the predicted and observed 2-year NRM in patients having an HCT-CI score of 0 and 1-2, whereas in the >/= 3 group the predicted NRM overestimated the observed NRM (41% vs 27.3%). HCT-CI alone was the strongest predictor of NRM in patients with lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia in first remission (c-statistics 0.66, 064, and 0.59, respectively). We confirm the clinical utility of the HCT-CI score that could also identify patients at low NRM risk possibly benefiting from an HSCT-based treatment strategy.","['Raimondi, Roberto', 'Tosetto, Alberto', 'Oneto, Rosi', 'Cavazzina, Riccardo', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Bosi, Alberto']","['Raimondi R', 'Tosetto A', 'Oneto R', 'Cavazzina R', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Fanin R', 'Rambaldi A', 'Bosi A']","['Department of Hematology, S.

To refine the IPSS, MDS patient databases from international institutions were coalesced to assemble a much larger combined database (Revised-IPSS [IPSS-R], n = 7012, IPSS, n = 816) for analysis. Multiple statistically weighted clinical features were used to generate a prognostic categorization model. Bone marrow cytogenetics, marrow blast percentage, and cytopenias remained the basis of the new system. Novel components of the current analysis included: 5 rather than 3 cytogenetic prognostic subgroups with specific and new classifications of a number of less common cytogenetic subsets, splitting the low marrow blast percentage value, and depth of cytopenias. This model defined 5 rather than the 4 major prognostic categories that are present in the IPSS. Patient age, performance status, serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase were significant additive features for survival but not for acute myeloid leukemia transformation. This system comprehensively integrated the numerous known clinical features into a method analyzing MDS patient prognosis more precisely than the initial IPSS. As such, this IPSS-R should prove beneficial for predicting the clinical outcomes of untreated MDS patients and aiding design and analysis of clinical trials in this disease.","['Greenberg, Peter L', 'Tuechler, Heinz', 'Schanz, Julie', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Bennett, John M', 'Bowen, David', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Krieger, Otto', 'Luebbert, Michael', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Magalhaes, Silvia M M', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Valent, Peter', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef']","['Greenberg PL', 'Tuechler H', 'Schanz J', 'Sanz G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Sole F', 'Bennett JM', 'Bowen D', 'Fenaux P', 'Dreyfus F', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kuendgen A', 'Levis A', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M', 'Cermak J', 'Fonatsch C', 'Le Beau MM', 'Slovak ML', 'Krieger O', 'Luebbert M', 'Maciejewski J', 'Magalhaes SM', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Sekeres M', 'Sperr WR', 'Stauder R', 'Tauro S', 'Valent P', 'Vallespi T', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Germing U', 'Haase D']","['Hematology Division, Stanford University Cancer Center, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. peterg@stanford.edu']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC4425443,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51695-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-420489 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 20;120(12):2454-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-420489.

Here we demonstrate that CLL cells undergo autophagy after treatment with therapeutic agents, including fludarabine, CAL-101, and flavopiridol as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agent thapsigargin. The addition of chloroquine or siRNA against autophagy components enhanced the cytotoxic effects of flavopiridol and thapsigargin, but not the other agents. Similar to thapsigargin, flavopiridol robustly induces a distinct pattern of ER stress in CLL cells that contributes to cell death through IRE1-mediated activation of ASK1 and possibly downstream caspases. Both autophagy and ER stress were documented in tumor cells from CLL patients receiving flavopiridol. Thus, CLL cells undergo autophagy after multiple stimuli, including therapeutic agents, but only with ER stress mediators and CDK inhibitors is autophagy a mechanism of resistance to cell death. These findings collectively demonstrate, for the first time, a novel mechanism of action (ER stress) and drug resistance (autophagy) for CDK inhibitors, such as flavopiridol in CLL, and provide avenues for new therapeutic combination approaches in this disease.","['Mahoney, Emilia', 'Lucas, David M', 'Gupta, Sneha V', 'Wagner, Amy J', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Yeh, Yuh-Ying', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Flynn, Joseph M', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Kong, Hui', 'Gurcan, Metin', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C']","['Mahoney E', 'Lucas DM', 'Gupta SV', 'Wagner AJ', 'Herman SE', 'Smith LL', 'Yeh YY', 'Andritsos L', 'Jones JA', 'Flynn JM', 'Blum KA', 'Zhang X', 'Lehman A', 'Kong H', 'Gurcan M', 'Grever MR', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3418721,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46528-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-400184 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 9;120(6):1262-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-400184.

Herein, we investigated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) phenotypes of Mll-PTD knock-in mice. Although HSPCs (Lin(-)Sca1(+)Kit(+) (LSK)/SLAM(+) and LSK) in Mll(PTD/WT) mice are reduced in absolute number in steady state because of increased apoptosis, they have a proliferative advantage in colony replating assays, CFU-spleen assays, and competitive transplantation assays over wild-type HSPCs. The Mll(PTD/WT)-derived phenotypic short-term (ST)-HSCs/multipotent progenitors and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors have self-renewal capability, rescuing hematopoiesis by giving rise to long-term repopulating cells in recipient mice with an unexpected myeloid differentiation blockade and lymphoid-lineage bias. However, Mll(PTD/WT) HSPCs never develop leukemia in primary or recipient mice, suggesting that additional genetic and/or epigenetic defects are necessary for full leukemogenic transformation.

To identify novel molecular and therapeutic targets, we performed combined gene expression microarray and promoter occupancy (ChIP-chip) profiling using Lin(-)/Sca1(-)/cKit(+) cells, the major leukemia cell population, from an AML mouse model induced by AML1-ETO9a (AE9a). Approximately 30% of the identified common targets of microarray and ChIP-chip assays overlap with the human t(8;21)-gene expression molecular signature. CD45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase and a negative regulator of cytokine/growth factor receptor and JAK/STAT signaling, is among those targets. Its expression is substantially down-regulated in leukemia cells. Consequently, JAK/STAT signaling is enhanced. Re-expression of CD45 suppresses JAK/STAT activation, delays leukemia development, and promotes apoptosis of t(8;21)-positive cells. This study demonstrates the benefit of combining gene expression and promoter occupancy profiling assays to identify molecular and potential therapeutic targets in human cancers and describes a previously unappreciated signaling pathway involving t(8;21) fusion proteins, CD45, and JAK/STAT, which could be a potential novel target for treating t(8;21) AML.","['Lo, Miao-Chia', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Yan, Ming', 'Cong, Xiuli', 'Jin, Fulai', 'Shia, Wei-Jong', 'Matsuura, Shinobu', 'Ahn, Eun-Young', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Ly, Minh', 'Ommen, Hans B', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Ren, Bing', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Lo MC', 'Peterson LF', 'Yan M', 'Cong X', 'Jin F', 'Shia WJ', 'Matsuura S', 'Ahn EY', 'Komeno Y', 'Ly M', 'Ommen HB', 'Chen IM', 'Hokland P', 'Willman CL', 'Ren B', 'Zhang DE']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HL091641/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120626,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3423785,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/11/02 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46501-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-395335 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 16;120(7):1473-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-395335.

The partial failure of classic therapeutic options makes scientists to doubt the efficacy of systemic treatments in targeting the essential cell populations and achieving cure as a final goal. Overgrowing data suggest that cancer is a disease closely linked to stem cells (SCs). It is well known that the first identification of cancer stem-like cells in acute myeloid leukaemia was soon followed by similar results in solid malignancies, including colorectal cancer, and the classic model for colon carcinogenesis supports the development of sudden mutations that will lead to the activation or inactivation of certain oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Thus, this process may go on for years before the first symptoms and the only cells able to withstand for many years, avoid apoptosis and have a high regenerative capacity are the progenitor cells found at the lower part of colon crypts. A more profound study of the mechanisms and molecular signalling pathways that control the basic characteristics of SCs, such as asymmetrical division or self-renewal, may help comprehend the basic mechanisms of cancer genesis and progression. This will result in the development of new therapeutic agents that may target chemoresistant cell populations and improve the therapeutic results. In the current review we point out the importance of cancer stem-like cells in colorectal oncology from a pathologist's point of view, stating the obvious correlation between histology, embryology and surgical pathology.","['Susman, S', 'Tomuleasa, C', 'Soritau, O', 'Mihu, C', 'Rus-Ciuca, D', 'Sabourin, J-C', 'Bibeau, F', 'Irimie, A', 'Buiga, R']","['Susman S', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Soritau O', 'Mihu C', 'Rus-Ciuca D', 'Sabourin JC', 'Bibeau F', 'Irimie A', 'Buiga R']","['Department of Pathology, Ion Chiricuta Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cluj Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2012 Apr-Jun;17(2):230-6.,20120731,,,,,IM,"['Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using population-based data from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry, we calculated cancer-related mortality counts and rates for the 3-year period 2006-2008 and trends between 1998 and 2008 by sex, age group, and cause of death (defined according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, third edition). Rates were directly age-standardised to the 2000 World Standard Population, and linear regression was used to determine the magnitude and significance of trends. The standardised mortality ratio for non-cancer deaths among children with cancer was also estimated. RESULTS: A total of 282 children (23 per million per year) died from cancer in Australia between 2006 and 2008. Large decreases were observed in cancer mortality rates over the study period, particularly for boys (-5.5% per year; p<0.001), children aged 10-14 years old (-5.5% per year; p=0.001), and leukaemia patients (-9.4% per year; p<0.001). However, there was no significant change in mortality due to tumours of the central nervous system. Children with cancer were twice as likely to die from non-cancer causes compared to other children (SMR=2.06; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While ongoing improvements in childhood cancer mortality in Australia are generally encouraging, of concern is the lack of a corresponding decrease in mortality among children with certain types of tumours of the central nervous system during the past decade. The results also highlight the need for intensive monitoring of childhood cancer patients for other serious diseases that may subsequently arise.","['Youlden, Danny R', 'Baade, Peter D', 'Valery, Patricia C', 'Ward, Leisa J', 'Green, Adele C', 'Aitken, Joanne F']","['Youlden DR', 'Baade PD', 'Valery PC', 'Ward LJ', 'Green AC', 'Aitken JF']","['Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. dannyyoulden@cancerqld.org.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120626,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(12)00077-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2012.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Oct;36(5):476-80. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2012.06.001.

This study aimed to determine if a facile assay of GR transcript levels might be promising for stratifying ALL patients into hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant populations. The GR transcript profiles of various lymphoid cell lines and 4 bone marrow samples from patients with T-cell ALL were analyzed using both an optimized branched DNA (bDNA) assay and a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. There were significant correlations between both assay platforms when measuring total GR (exon 5/6) transcripts in various cell lines and patient samples, but not for a probe set that detects a specific, low abundance GR transcript (exon 1A3). Our results suggest that the bDNA platform is reproducible and precise when measuring total GR transcripts and, with further development, may ultimately offer a simple clinical assay to aid in the prediction of GC-sensitivity in ALL patients.","['Schwartz, Jason R', 'Sarvaiya, Purvaba J', 'Leiva, Lily E', 'Velez, Maria C', 'Singleton, Tammuella C', 'Yu, Lolie C', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Schwartz JR', 'Sarvaiya PJ', 'Leiva LE', 'Velez MC', 'Singleton TC', 'Yu LC', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Stanley S.

This study was purposed to investigate the TEC promoter mediated P210(bcr/abl) gene expression in BaF3 cells. The CMVie promotes of IRES2-eGFP vector was replaced with the -364-+22 domain of TEC promoter cloned from mouse genome, and the P210(bcr/abl) gene was inserted into the EcoR I site of TEC-IRES2-eGFP vector. Then, the constructed vector was transfected into the BaF3 cells and 293 cells respectively. The expression levels of eGFP gene and P210(bcr/abl) gene in BaF3 and 293 cells were detected. The results showed that with fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry, the eGFP gene was found to be expressed in the BaF3 cells, the expression rate was 7.10%, 23.35%, 64.61% at 6, 24, 72 h respectively after transfection, but the fluorescence was not seen in 293 cells. A 372 bp fragment of BCR/ABL mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR in BaF3 cells, but not in 293 cells.

The CD34(+)CD19(+) bone marrow (BM) cells were sorted from the CD3(-)CD4(-)CD8(-) fraction of B-ALL patients by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and injected into 100 cGy irradiated neonatal NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) mice through facial vein. The engraftment and proliferation of human B-ALL cells were monitored by the presence of human CD45(+)CD19(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB). Human hematopoietic chimerism in PB, BM and spleen of the recipients was examined by multiparameter flow cytometry. Morphological analyses of FACS-sorted murine marrow cells were performed by using May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining. Furthermore, leukemia cell infiltration in the organs was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The results indicated that the sorted CD34(+)CD19(+) cells were able to initiate human B-ALL in vivo. The percentages of human CD45(+)CD19(+) cells in PB, BM and spleen of the recipient mice were (83.36 +/- 10.05)%, (93.88 +/- 5.05)% and (88.31 +/- 5.01)%, respectively.

The clinical and laboratorial data of 40 CLL patients admitted from 2004 to 2010 in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The results indicated that the most of CLL attacked the elderly male patients with median age 66 (from 42 to 80). Flow cytometric analysis showed that 25 cases were positive for typical immunophenotype of CLL. On the other hand, all the patients clearly expressed CD19 and CD5, 7 cases (17.5%) and 14 cases (35%) were positive for the expression of CD38 and Zap70 respectively. 8 cases harbored a mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain (VH) gene, among them 4 cases belong to VH3 family. Interphase FISH analysis showed that P53 deletion, RB1 deletion, trisomy 12 and normal chromosome were detected in 6, 3, 1, and 5 cases, respectively. The median PFS in 31 patients received treatment of fludarabine based chemotherapy was 48 months (95%CI: 39 - 57 months), among them 27 cases (87.1%) achieved CR + PR. While PFS was 14 months (95%CI: 10 - 18 months, P < 0.001) in 9 patients received other treatment regimen, out of them only 3 cases (33.3%) achieved CR + PR.

Significant difference in the rate of CR + PR was noted in the Zap70 positive group (50%) and in negative group (88.5%, P = 0.006). All of 8 patients with IgVH mutation displayed CR after treatment, while 4 cases (66.7%) archived CR among 6 patients without IgVH mutation. It is concluded that CLL is characterized by high heterogeneity in both clinical features and molecular markers, which are associated with prediction of outcomes for patients. The treatment with fludarabine-based chemotherapy results in a major benefit and long survival for patients with CLL.","['Xu, Zhen-Shu', 'Zhang, Jin-Yan', 'Zhan, Rong', 'Zheng, Zhi-Hong', 'Wu, Shun-Quan', 'Chen, Zhi-Zhe']","['Xu ZS', 'Zhang JY', 'Zhan R', 'Zheng ZH', 'Wu SQ', 'Chen ZZ']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)03-0583-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Jun;20(3):583-6.,20130516,,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of B7-H1 mRNA was detected by SYBR Green I real-time quantitative PCR in a panel of 9 leukemia cell lines, 4 leukemia cell lines induced with IFN-gamma, the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from 59 initial leukemia patients and 10 dendritic cells (DC) derived from BMMNC of initial leukemia patients, 2 solid tumour cell lines and BMMNC from 10 normal persons. The correlation between the clinical features of 59 acute leukemia patients and the expression level of B7-H1 mRNA in leukemia cells was analyzed. The results showed that the lower level of B7-H1 mRNA expression was found in leukemia cell lines and primary acute leukemia cells, but the expression level of B7-H1 mRNA was up-regulated significantly in the leukemia cell lines induced by IFN-gamma and DC derived from BMMNC of leukemia patients. The expression level of B7-H1 mRNA in non complete remission (CR) patients after therapy was significantly higher than that in CR patients.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the clean-up workers of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident and it has some specific features. Therefore, we have studied the possible differences in DNA repair gene polymorphisms in CLL patients depending on ionizing radiation (IR) exposure history and their clinical characterictics. Arg399Gln XRCC1, Thr241Met XRCC3, and Lys751Gln XPD polymorphisms were studied in 64 CLL patients, exposed to IR due to the Chernobyl NPP accident, 114 IR-non-exposed CLL patients, and 103 sex- and age-matched IR-exposed controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. All investigated polymorphisms were equally distributed between two groups of CLL patients and IR-exposed controls, except that that there was a significant reduction of the common homozygous Lys/Lys XPD genotype among IR-exposed CLL patients (23.7%) compared with IR-exposed controls (45.6%), OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.18-0.75; (P = 0.005). The number of IR-non-exposed CLL patients (37.4%) with the Lys/Lys XPD genotype was also decreased compared to IR-exposed controls, although this difference was not significant (P = 0.223). These preliminary data suggest a possible modifying role of Lys751Gln XPD polymorphism for the development of CLL, expecially in radiation-exposed persons.","['Abramenko, Iryna', 'Bilous, Nadiia', 'Chumak, Anatolyi', 'Kostin, Alexey', 'Martina, Zoya', 'Dyagil, Iryna']","['Abramenko I', 'Bilous N', 'Chumak A', 'Kostin A', 'Martina Z', 'Dyagil I']","['Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jrr/11093 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.11093 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2012;53(3):497-503. doi: 10.1269/jrr.11093.,20130117,,,,"['EC 3.6.4.12 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein)', 'EC 5.99.- (ERCC2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/history', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics/history', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Power Plants/history', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Ukraine', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1990s, Takizawa et al. found that mouse cells displayed a decreased growth rate under shielded conditions. The purpose of the present study was to confirm that growth is impaired in organisms that have been shielded from background radiation. Radioprotection was produced with a shielding chamber surrounded by a 15 cm thick iron wall and a 10 cm thick paraffin wall that reduced the gamma ray and neutron levels in the chamber to 2% and 25% of the background levels, respectively. Although the growth of Paramecium tetraurelia was not impaired by short-term radioprotection (around 10 days), which disagreed with the findings of Planel et al., decreased growth was observed after long-term (40-50 days) radiation shielding. When mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were incubated inside or outside of the shielding chamber for 7 days, the number of cells present on the 6th and 7th days under the shielding conditions was significantly lower than that present under the non-shielding conditions. These inhibitory effects on cell growth were abrogated by the addition of a (1)(3)(7)Cs gamma-ray source disk to the chamber.

RESULTS: In total, 878 CML patients who received second-line treatment with either dasatinib (n = 550) or nilotinib (n = 328) were studied. Dasatinib users were less adherent compared to nilotinib users; mean MPR was 0.739 (standard deviation [SD] 0.246) for dasatinib and 0.800 (SD 0.246) for nilotinib (adjusted difference = 0.061; P = 0.002). Subgroup analyses of patients who initiated dasatinib 100 mg/day and 140 mg/day separately presented similar trends; after multivariate adjustment, adherence was 0.039 points lower in the 100 mg/day group (P = 0.034) and 0.120 points lower in the 140 mg/day group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients treated in the second-line CML setting, those treated with nilotinib had significantly higher adherence compared to patients treated with dasatinib, regardless of dasatinib dose (100 mg/day and 140 mg/day). LIMITATIONS: The study was subject to common limitations of claims data, which lack clinical information, may contain inaccuracies in diagnosis and procedure coding, and may not truly reflect actual drug consumption. Moreover, daily doses calculated based on refill records may not reflect accurate dosing regimens.","['Guerin, Annie', 'Chen, Lei', 'Wu, Eric Q', 'Ponce de Leon, Diego', 'Griffin, James D']","['Guerin A', 'Chen L', 'Wu EQ', 'Ponce de Leon D', 'Griffin JD']","['Analysis Group, Boston, MA, USA. aguerin@analysisgroup.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120628,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2012.705264 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2012 Jul;28(7):1155-62. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2012.705264.

Moreover, multicolour flow cytometry (MFC) has been increasingly employed in identifying leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) with significant progress being made in standardization. In translating these widely varying methodologies to parameters useful for individualized patient decision-making, one of the obstacles has been that the assays entail varying sensitivities dependent on a number of variables. For qPCR, sensitivity depends on target type (i.e. fusion transcript, mutated gene or even overexpressed gene) and - in the case of overexpressed genes - on expression in healthy haematopoiesis. For MFC, sensitivity is likewise largely a function on whether the same phenotype is seen in normal immature cells and, in addition, antigen drift/shift with LAIPs changing at relapse is a well-known problem. In considering which sensitivity to opt for, a further variable is the situation of patient, most importantly the level of cytoreduction intended. Here we will attempt to give an overview of these pertinent questions intended for the practicing haematologist, focusing on where the field is heading at the clinical level.","['Hokland, Peter', 'Ommen, Hans Beier', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg', 'Roug, Anne Stidsholt']","['Hokland P', 'Ommen HB', 'Nyvold CG', 'Roug AS']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. phokland@ki.au.dk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120628,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09203.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Sep;158(5):569-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09203.x.

Thus, there is an unmet clinical and experimental need for SOX11-targeting assays with low background, high specificity and robust performance in multiple applications, including immunohistochemistry (IHC-P) and flow cytometry, which until now has been lacking. METHODS: We have developed SOX11-C1, a monoclonal mouse antibody targeting SOX11, and successfully evaluated its performance in western blots (WB), IHC-P, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. RESULTS: We confirm the importance of SOX11 as a diagnostic antigen in MCL as 100% of tissue micro array (TMA) cases show bright nuclear staining, using the SOX11-C1 antibody in IHC-P. We also show that previous reports of weak SOX11 immunostaining in a fraction of hairy cell leukemias (HCL) are not confirmed using SOX11-C1, which is consistent with the lack of transcription. Thus, high sensitivity and improved specificity are demonstrated using the monoclonal SOX11-C1 antibody. Furthermore, we show for the first time that flow cytometry can be used to separate SOX11 positive and negative cell lines and primary tumors. Of note, SOX11-C1 shows no nonspecific binding to primary B or T cells in blood and thus, can be used for analysis of B and T cell lymphomas from complex clinical samples. Dilution experiments showed that low frequencies of malignant cells (~1%) are detectable above background using SOX11 as a discriminant antigen in flow cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: The novel monoclonal SOX11-specific antibody offers high sensitivity and improved specificity in IHC-P based detection of MCL and its expanded use in flow cytometry analysis of blood and tissue samples may allow a convenient approach to early diagnosis and follow-up of MCL patients.","['Nordstrom, Lena', 'Andreasson, Ulrika', 'Jerkeman, Mats', 'Dictor, Michael', 'Borrebaeck, Carl', 'Ek, Sara']","['Nordstrom L', 'Andreasson U', 'Jerkeman M', 'Dictor M', 'Borrebaeck C', 'Ek S']","['Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, BMCD13, Lund, SE-221 84, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC3495897,2012/06/29 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-269 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-269 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Jun 27;12:269. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-269.,20130712,10.1186/1471-2407-12-269 [doi],,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*chemistry/immunology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the high incidence of ATLL in HTLV-1-endemic areas is well known, population-based evidence concerning the incidence of ATLL in non-endemic areas is scarce. To answer this, we estimated the age-standardized incidence of ATLL from 1993 to 2006 for Japan and 1993 to 2008 for the US and assessed its trend using data from a population-based cancer registry in Japan and Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) in the US. The Japanese data were collected from 15 prefectures. A total of 2055 patients in the three prefectures in Kyushu and 1380 patients in the 12 prefectures in Honshu were diagnosed with ATLL in the study period. In the US, a total of 140 patients were diagnosed with ATLL. The results showed that the age-standardized incidence in non-endemic areas in Japan and in the US significantly increased during this period (annual percent change [95%CI]; Japan-Honshu: +4.6% [1.1, 8.2]; US: +6.2% [1.5, 11.1]), while in the endemic areas of Japan there was no change (annual percent change [95%CI]; Japan-Kyushu: 0.0% [-1.6, 1.7]).

However, production of immature hematopoietic cells, especially HSPCs, from ES and iPS cells has been challenging. The adaptor protein Lnk has been shown to negatively regulate HSPC function via the inhibition of thrombopoietin (TPO) and stem cell factor signaling, and Lnk-deficient HSPCs show an enhanced self-renewal and repopulation capacity. In this study, we examined the role of Lnk on the hematopoietic differentiation from mouse ES and iPS cells by the inhibition of Lnk using a dominant-negative mutant of the Lnk (DN-Lnk) gene. We generated mouse ES and iPS cells stably expressing a DN-Lnk, and found that enforced expression of a DN-Lnk in ES and iPS cells led to an enhanced generation of Flk-1-positive mesodermal cells, thereby could increase in the expression of hematopoietic transcription factors, including Scl and Runx1. We also showed that the number of both total hematopoietic cells and immature hematopoietic cells with colony-forming potential in DN-Lnk-expressing cells was significantly increased in comparison with that in control cells. Furthermore, Lnk inhibition by the overexpression of the DN-Lnk gene augmented the TPO-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt, indicating the enhanced sensitivity to TPO. Adenovirus vector-mediated transient DN-Lnk gene expression in ES and iPS cells could also increase the hematopoietic cell production.

ANIMALS: 10 mature ewes seronegative for Anaplasma spp and 251 sheep from 8 flocks. PROCEDURES: 10 ewes received 1 of 3 treatments: A phagocytophilum Webster strain (n = 4), A phagocytophilum MRK strain (4), or human promyelocytic leukemia cells (control treatment [2]). Sheep were monitored for signs of clinical disease, and blood samples were obtained for serologic and PCR assay evaluation intermittently for 48 days. From a subsample of sheep from each of 8 free-ranging flocks, blood samples were obtained to determine Anaplasma spp seroprevalence. RESULTS: Sheep inoculated with A phagocytophilum developed subclinical or mild disease, whereas sheep inoculated with the control treatment did not develop any signs of disease. Only 2 ewes seroconverted; both had received the MRK strain. Anaplasma-specific DNA was detected in blood samples from 1 sheep in the Webster strain-inoculated group and 3 sheep in the MRK strain-inoculated group. Sheep seropositive for Anaplasma spp were detected in 5 of 8 flocks, and flocks in the Sierra Nevada foothills had higher within-flock seroprevalence (22%) than did flocks in the Oregon Coast Range (6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Infection with A phagocytophilum in mature sheep generally resulted in subclinical disease. Higher Anaplasma spp seroprevalence in sheep in the Sierra Nevada foothills corresponded to the geographic distribution of anaplasmosis reported for dogs, horses, and humans.","['Gorman, Jennifer K', 'Hoar, Bruce R', 'Nieto, Nathan C', 'Foley, Janet E']","['Gorman JK', 'Hoar BR', 'Nieto NC', 'Foley JE']","['Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1029 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2012 Jul;73(7):1029-34. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1029.,20121121,10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1029 [doi],,,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'California/epidemiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics', 'Ehrlichiosis/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Male', 'Oregon/epidemiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Random Allocation', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/epidemiology/*microbiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, severe allergic reactions have been reported after the consumption of food products containing deamidated gluten (DG) in subjects tolerant to wheat. This work aimed to characterize allergen profiles for these patients in comparison with those of patients allergic to wheat and to identify IgE-binding epitopes. METHODS: Sera were obtained from 15 patients allergic to DG and from nine patients allergic to wheat proteins (WP). IgE-binding profiles were characterized both in ELISA and in a humanized rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cell model. Epitopes were mapped on gamma- and omega2-gliadin sequences by Pepscan, and effect of glutamine/glutamic acid substitutions was studied. RESULTS: Compared to the heterogeneous pattern of allergens detected by IgE from patients allergic to WP, responses of patients allergic to DG were homogeneous. In ELISA, all the sera displayed IgE binding to deamidated gamma- and omega2-gliadins and deamidated total gliadins, frequently with high concentrations. These modified proteins induced RBL degranulation with most of the sera from DG-allergic patients. A consensus epitope was found on native gamma- and omega2-gliadins (QPQQPFPQ); it was repeated several times in their sequences. The substitution of two or three glutamines of this epitope into glutamic acid at positions Q3 or Q4 and Q8 (QPEEPFPE) increased its recognition the best. CONCLUSION: Allergy to DG is a separate entity from wheat allergy. It can be evidenced by strong IgE binding to deamidated gliadins or peptides of the type QPEEPFPE.","['Denery-Papini, S', 'Bodinier, M', 'Larre, C', 'Brossard, C', 'Pineau, F', 'Triballeau, S', 'Pietri, M', 'Battais, F', 'Mothes, T', 'Paty, E', 'Moneret-Vautrin, D-A']","['Denery-Papini S', 'Bodinier M', 'Larre C', 'Brossard C', 'Pineau F', 'Triballeau S', 'Pietri M', 'Battais F', 'Mothes T', 'Paty E', 'Moneret-Vautrin DA']","['UR1268 Biopolymers, Interactions, Assemblies, INRA, Nantes Cedex 03, France. denery@nantes.inra.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120628,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,,2012/06/29 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2012/06/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02860.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2012 Aug;67(8):1023-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02860.x.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of educating parents of leukemic children on the patients' quality of life. METHODS: In this interventional study, sixty parents of ALL children who met inclusion criteria were selected using simple random sampling method, and assigned to the experimental and control groups. The study tool included a valid and reliable questionnaire (TNO-AZL), that was filled in through interview by parents before and two months after the intervention for both groups. The first part of the questionnaire included demographic items and the second part (7 dimensions, each with 8 sections) contained questions related to the quality of life. The scores could range between 56 and 280 and a higher score represented a better quality of life. The intervention included three one-hour classes composed of lecture and question-answer sessions which were held for groups of 4-6 participants, accompanied by a booklet. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the quality of life score in the experimental and control groups was 180.83+/-14.43 and 174.28+/-20.72, respectively; after the intervention, these figures changed to 226.9+/-11.76 and 174.41+/-20.42 respectively. Paired samples T-test proved a significant increase in the quality of life in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: Parent education successfully increased the quality of life of leukemic children; therefore, parental consultation sessions and educational programs are recommended.","['Hashemi, F', 'Asadi, N', 'Beheshtipour, N', 'Karimi, M']","['Hashemi F', 'Asadi N', 'Beheshtipour N', 'Karimi M']","['Nursing and Midwifery College, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110801,Iran,Iran Red Crescent Med J,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,101319850,PMC3371991,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/06/28 06:01,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2011 Aug;13(8):550-5.

HTLV-1 has a preferential tropism for CD4 T cells in healthy carriers and ATL patients, while both CD4 and CD8 T cells serve as viral reservoirs in HAM/TSP patients. HTLV-1 has also been detected other cell types, including monocytes, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. In contrast to the limited cell tropism of HTLV-1 in vivo, the HTLV receptor appears to be expressed in almost all human or animal cell lines. It remains to be examined whether this cell tropism is determined by host factors or by HTLV-1 heterogeneity. Unlike most retroviruses, cell-free virions of HTLV-1 are very poorly infectious. The lack of completely HTLV-1-resistant cells and the low infectivity of HTLV-1 have hampered research on the HTLV entry receptor. Entry of HTLV-1 into target cells is thought to involve interactions between the env (Env) glycoproteins, a surface glycoprotein (surface unit), and a transmembrane glycoprotein. Recent studies have shown that glucose transporter GLUT1, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) are the three proteins important for the entry of HTLV-1. Studies using adherent cell lines have shown that GLUT1 can function as a receptor for HTLV. HSPGs are required for efficient entry of HTLV-1 into primary CD4 T cells. NRP-1 is expressed in most established cell lines. Further studies have shown that these three molecules work together to promote HTLV-1 binding to cells and fusion of viral and cell membranes. The virus could first contact with HSPGs and then form complexes with NRP-1, followed by association with GLUT1. It remains to be determined whether these three molecules can explain HTLV-1 cell tropism. It also remains to be more definitively proven that these molecules are sufficient to permit HTLV-1 entry into completely HTLV-1-resistant cells.","['Hoshino, Hiroo']",['Hoshino H'],"['Advanced Scientific Research-Leaders Development Unit, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120621,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC3380293,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/06/28 06:01,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00222 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Jun 21;3:222. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00222. eCollection 2012.,20121002,10.3389/fmicb.2012.00222 [doi],['NOTNLM'],"['Env isomerization', 'Env proteins', 'cell tropism', 'epidemiology', 'glucose transporter GLUT1', 'heparan sulfate', 'neuropilin-1', 'syncytia formation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applying this method to primary human bone marrow specimens from patients with Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia (AML), we demonstrated that genetically distinct AML subtypes display diametrically opposed DNA methylation patterns. As compared to normal controls, we observed widespread hypermethylation in IDH mutant AMLs, preferentially targeting promoter regions and CpG islands neighboring the transcription start sites of genes. In contrast, AMLs harboring translocations affecting the MLL gene displayed extensive loss of methylation of an almost mutually exclusive set of CpGs, which instead affected introns and distal intergenic CpG islands and shores. When analyzed in conjunction with gene expression profiles, it became apparent that these specific patterns of DNA methylation result in differing roles in gene expression regulation. However, despite this subtype-specific DNA methylation patterning, a much smaller set of CpG sites are consistently affected in both AML subtypes. Most CpG sites in this common core of aberrantly methylated CpGs were hypermethylated in both AML subtypes. Therefore, aberrant DNA methylation patterns in AML do not occur in a stereotypical manner but rather are highly specific and associated with specific driving genetic lesions.","['Akalin, Altuna', 'Garrett-Bakelman, Francine E', 'Kormaksson, Matthias', 'Busuttil, Jennifer', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Khrebtukova, Irina', 'Milne, Thomas A', 'Huang, Yongsheng', 'Biswas, Debabrata', 'Hess, Jay L', 'Allis, C David', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Schroth, Gary P', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Figueroa, Maria E']","['Akalin A', 'Garrett-Bakelman FE', 'Kormaksson M', 'Busuttil J', 'Zhang L', 'Khrebtukova I', 'Milne TA', 'Huang Y', 'Biswas D', 'Hess JL', 'Allis CD', 'Roeder RG', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R', 'Fernandez HF', 'Paietta E', 'Tallman MS', 'Schroth GP', 'Mason CE', 'Melnick A', 'Figueroa ME']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA151425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01NS076465-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS076465/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG013283/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,PMC3380828,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1002781 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-11-02802 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2012;8(6):e1002781. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002781.

Data on all validated miR-155 target genes was collated to identify biologic pathways relevant to miR-155 and breast cancer progression. Publications describing the clinical relevance, functional characterization, and regulation of expression of miR-155 in the context of breast cancer are reviewed. A total of 147 validated miR-155 target genes were identified from the literature. Pathway analysis of these genes identified likely roles in apoptosis, differentiation, angiogenesis, proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The large number of validated miR-155 targets presented here provide many avenues of interest as to the clinical potential of miR-155. Further investigation of these target genes will be required to elucidate the specific mechanisms and functions of miR-155 in breast cancer. This is the first review examining the role of miR-155 in breast cancer progression. The collated data of target genes and biologic pathways of miR-155 identified in this review suggest new avenues of research for this oncogenic miRNA.","['Mattiske, Sam', 'Suetani, Rachel J', 'Neilsen, Paul M', 'Callen, David F']","['Mattiske S', 'Suetani RJ', 'Neilsen PM', 'Callen DF']","['Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine, Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Australia. samuel.mattiske@adelaide.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120626,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-0173 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0173 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Aug;21(8):1236-43. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0173.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively assessed 206 adult patients who had AML with an intermediate-risk karyotype and who received treatment on a uniform induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: The presenting WBC was a prognostic factor for survival only in patients who had an FLT3-ITD mutation. On multivariate analysis, after correcting for age, WBC, secondary AML, and blast percentage, nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)-mutated/FLT3-ITD-negative patients had superior overall survival compared with patients in the other molecular subgroups. Patients who had FLT3-ITD mutations had an inferior overall survival compared with patients who had NPM1 wild-type/FLT3-negative disease, and patients who had low or intermediate levels of the FLT-ITD of mutant allele had overall and disease-free survival similar to those in patients who had high-level mutations. CONCLUSIONS: NPM1 and FLT3-ITD status, age, WBC, and secondary AML were identified as important prognostic variables that can help to risk stratify patients with AML who have intermediate-risk cytogenetics. FLT3 allele burden had no significant influence on outcomes after correcting for other variables.","['How, Jonathan', 'Sykes, Jenna', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Yee, Karen W L', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Brandwein, Joseph M']","['How J', 'Sykes J', 'Gupta V', 'Yee KW', 'Schimmer AD', 'Schuh AC', 'Minden MD', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Brandwein JM']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120626,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27683 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;118(24):6110-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27683.

Recent evidence suggests that they play a negative role in T-cell signaling. In order to define whether Dok proteins regulate T-cell development, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing Dok-1 in thymocytes and peripheral T cells. We show that overexpression of Dok-1 retards the transition from the CD4(-) CD8(-) to CD4(+) CD8(+) stage. Moreover, there is a specific expansion of PLZF-expressing Vgamma1.1(+) Vdelta6.3(+) T cells. This subset of gammadelta T cells acquires innate characteristics including rapid IL-4 production following stimulation and requiring SLAM-associated adaptor protein (SAP) for their development. Moreover, Dok-1 overexpression promotes the generation of an innate-like CD8(+) T-cell population that expresses Eomesodermin. Altogether, these findings identify a novel role for Dok-1 in the regulation of thymic differentiation and in particular, in the development of PLZF(+) gammadelta T cells.","['Besin, Gilles', 'Yousefi, Mitra', 'Saba, Ingrid', 'Klinck, Roscoe', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Duplay, Pascale']","['Besin G', 'Yousefi M', 'Saba I', 'Klinck R', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Duplay P']","['Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Laval, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120716,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201242421 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2012 Sep;42(9):2491-504. doi: 10.1002/eji.201242421.

In this study, we have examined the ability of T cells from CLL patients to support the survival of the leukemic B cells in vitro. Additionally, we compared global gene expression of T cells from indolent CLL patients with healthy individuals and multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Apoptosis of purified leukemic B cells was inhibited in vitro when co-cultured with increasing numbers of autologous T cells (p < 0.01) but not autologous B and T cells of normal donors. The anti-apoptotic effect exceeded that of the anti-apoptotic cytokine IL-4 (p = 0.002) and was greater with CD8+ cells (p = 0.02) than with CD4+ cells (p = 0.05). The effect was depended mainly on cell-cell contact although a significant effect was also observed in transwell experiments (p = 0.05). About 356 genes involved in different cellular pathways were deregulated in T cells of CLL patients compared to healthy individuals and MM patients. The results of gene expression profiling were verified for 6 genes (CCL4, CCL5 (RANTES), XCL1, XCL2, KLF6, and TRAF1) using qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Our results demonstrate that CLL-derived T cells can prevent apoptosis of leukemic B cells and have altered expression of genes that may facilitate the survival of the leukemic clone.","['Kiaii, Shahryar', 'Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Mozaffari, Fariba', 'Rossmann, Eva', 'Pak, Fatemeh', 'Moshfegh, Ali', 'Palma, Marzia', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Mashayekhi, Kaveh', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Choudhury, Aniruddha', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Kiaii S', 'Kokhaei P', 'Mozaffari F', 'Rossmann E', 'Pak F', 'Moshfegh A', 'Palma M', 'Hansson L', 'Mashayekhi K', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Osterborg A', 'Choudhury A', 'Mellstedt H']","['Institute of Cancer, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1300-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Jan;62(1):51-63. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1300-y.

However, no mutations in the PTPN11, RAS, and CBL genes, or clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 1, which are associated with JMML, were detected. The patient subsequently developed refractory eczema with undetectable serum IgM, which led to the consideration of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Lack of WASP expression and a 4-nucleotide deletion mutation in WASP were identified. Approximately 20 % of patients with JMML show none of the abovementioned molecular abnormalities.

Wellseparated protein spots were selected from the gel using the ImageMaster 2D Platinum analysis system. Moreover, the effects of various protein sample sizes (140, 160 and 180 microg) on the 2-DE maps of the NB4 cells were determined and compared. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and database searching were used to identify the proteins. When the quantity of loading proteins was 160 microg, clear, well-resolved, reproducible 2-DE proteomic profiles of the NB4 cells were obtained. The average number of protein spots in 3 gels was 1160+/-51 with an average matching rate of 81%. A total of 10 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and database queries, certain proteins were products of oncogenes and others were involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. In summary, 2-DE profiles of the proteome of NB4 cells were established and certain proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF which lay the foundation of further proteomic research of NB4 cells.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that XMRV is a laboratory-derived virus resulting from genetic recombination between two mouse viral genomes during serial xenograft tissue transplantation. This study describes a phylogenetic analysis that compared XMRV with the ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (E-MLV), xenotropic MLV (X-MLV), and other retroviruses, including HTLV-1 and HIV-1. We found that sequences corresponding to three XMRV structural proteins (Env, Gag, and Pol) exhibited high degrees of homology with X-MLV (>91 %) and E-MLV (67-96 %), but not HTLV-1 (13-16 %) or HIV-1 (10-15 %), indicating that XMRV was derived from X-MLV and/or E-MLV. We then compared the infectivity of XMRV and E-MLV for human and murine lymphocytes, respectively. Results showed that human PBMCs were not susceptible to XMRV infection, suggesting that XMRV exhibits host cell tropism similar to E-MLV that only infects murine PBMCs. These data suggest that it is unlikely that this laboratory-generated retrovirus could cause disease in humans.","['Ma, Xiaochu', 'Zhou, Shiying', 'Wei, Meili', 'Chen, Yanxia', 'Li, Jiaqiang', 'Xiong, Weiliang', 'Jiang, Shibo', 'Pan, Chungen']","['Ma X', 'Zhou S', 'Wei M', 'Chen Y', 'Li J', 'Xiong W', 'Jiang S', 'Pan C']","['The Institute of Human Virology and Department of Biochemistry, Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control of Ministry of Education, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11262-012-0778-x [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2012 Oct;45(2):218-24. doi: 10.1007/s11262-012-0778-x.

METHODS: Isolated testicular cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS). During the culture, enriched spermatogonial cells were treated with a combination of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the presence or absence of human placental laminin-coated dishes. Cluster assay was performed during culture. Presence of spermatogonia was determined by an ultrastructural study of the cell clusters, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for spermatogonial markers and xenotransplantation to the testes of busulfan-treated recipient mice. Statistical significance between mean values was determined using statistical ANOVA tests. RESULTS: The findings indicated that the addition of GDNF, bFGF, EGF and LIF on laminin-coated dishes significantly increased in-vitro spermatogonial cell cluster formation in comparison with the control group (p </= 0.001). The expression of spermatogonial markers was maintained throughout the culture period. Furthermore, a transplantation experiment showed the presence of SSC among the cultured cells. In addition, a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study suggested the presence of spermatogonial cells of typical morphology among the cluster cells. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that human SSCs obtained from non-obstructive azoospermic (NOA) patients had the ability to self-renew in the culture system. This system can be used for the propagation of a small number of these cells from small biopsies.","['Koruji, Morteza', 'Shahverdi, Abdulhossein', 'Janan, Arghavan', 'Piryaei, Abbas', 'Lakpour, Mohammad Reza', 'Gilani Sedighi, Mohammad Ali']","['Koruji M', 'Shahverdi A', 'Janan A', 'Piryaei A', 'Lakpour MR', 'Gilani Sedighi MA']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center and Department of Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Highway, Tehran, Iran. skoruji@tums.ac.ir']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,Netherlands,J Assist Reprod Genet,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,9206495,PMC3463662,2012/06/28 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10815-012-9817-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Assist Reprod Genet. 2012 Sep;29(9):957-67. doi: 10.1007/s10815-012-9817-8.

Our aim was to study angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) in pediatric oncological patients at diagnosis and a few months after the beginning of the therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four consecutive patients with malignancy were included in this study. The levels of plasma and bone marrow VEGF and Ang2 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The levels of VEGF were higher in patients with solid tumors than in patients with leukemias (P=0.003), whereas Ang2 concentrations showed the opposite (P=0.003). Interestingly, the plasma concentrations of both VEGF and Ang2 correlated with concentrations in the bone marrow (P<0.05). Leukemia patients with lower VEGF level and patients with higher Ang2 level at follow-up had longer event-free survival than other patients (P=0.032 and 0.053, respectively). DISCUSSION: The results of our study enlighten the behavior of 2 different angiogenic factors in pediatric patients with malignancy. An interesting finding was the connection between survival of pediatric leukemia patients and angiogenic factor levels a few months after the beginning of therapy. Pathophysiology and clinical applications of these findings need further studies.","['Hintsala, Emilia', 'Bono, Petri', 'Andersson, Sture', 'Kivivuori, Sanna-Maria']","['Hintsala E', 'Bono P', 'Andersson S', 'Kivivuori SM']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318257f2a8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Oct;34(7):503-10. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318257f2a8.,20121207,,,,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Angiopoietin-2/*analysis/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry/mortality', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*analysis/blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each treatment can achieve hematologic improvement and enhance quality of life. Azacitidine is the only treatment to show a significant survival advantage in patients with higher-risk MDS compared with conventional care regimens. The treatment panorama has been further enhanced with immunosuppressive agents, growth factor support, and biologic response modifiers.

Epimutation has been shown for many tumor suppressor genes, including RB, VHL, hMLH1, APC and BRCA1, in sporadic cancers. Methylation has recently been shown in DNA from normal tissues and peripheral blood in cases of sporadic colorectal cancer and many studies show constitutive epimutation in cancers.

Recently, the focus on metabolism has been reemphasized as critical signaling and regulatory pathways of human pathophysiology, ranging from cancer to aging, often converge on metabolic responses. Here, we used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. We constructed a genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation are identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions.

Tax-specific CTL responses against tumor cells were restricted by Tax-expression and the appropriate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Tax-specific CTL recognized HLA/Tax-peptide complexes on autologous ATL cells, even when their Tax expression was so low that it could only be detected by RT-PCR but not by flow cytometry. Recognition resulted in interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and target cell lysis. This would be the first report that Tax-specific CTL from ATL patients specifically recognized and killed autologous tumor cells that expressed Tax. The Tax-specific CTL responded to as little as 0.01 pM of the corresponding peptide, indicating that their T-cell receptor avidity was much higher than that of any other CTL recognizing viral or other tumor antigens. This is presumably the reason why the Tax-specific CTL recognized and killed autologous ATL cells despite their very low Tax expression. In addition, cell cycle analyses and experiments with primary ATL cell-bearing mice demonstrated that ATL cells present at the site of active cell proliferation, such as in the tumor masses, expressed substantial amounts of Tax, but it was minimally expressed by the tumor cells in a quiescent state, such as in the blood. The present study not only provides a strong rationale for exploiting Tax as a possible target for ATL immunotherapy but also contributes to our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of ATL.","['Suzuki, Susumu', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Mori, Fumiko', 'Sato, Fumihiko', 'Narita, Tomoko', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Fukumori, Yasuo', 'Nishikawa, Hiroyoshi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Niimi, Akio', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Suzuki S', 'Masaki A', 'Ishida T', 'Ito A', 'Mori F', 'Sato F', 'Narita T', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Fukumori Y', 'Nishikawa H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Niimi A', 'Inagaki H', 'Iida S', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Medical Oncology & Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120813,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC7659279,2012/06/28 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02371.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Oct;103(10):1764-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02371.x.

Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. MDCT is superior to radiography in showing the distribution of the disease. PURPOSE: To review the 64 multidetector CT thoracic findings of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in patients with hematologic malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 12 patients (3 women, 9 men; mean age, 32.2 years). All patients proved to be infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus. The hematologic malignancies were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), multiple myeloma (n = 1), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). All the patients underwent CT scanning using a 64 multidetector CT scanner. Chest CT scans were reviewed for ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, airway thickening/dilatation, nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. RESULTS: More than one CT finding was detected in every patient. Pulmonary affection was bilateral, more on the left side. The affections were mainly peribronchial. Airway wall thickening and dilatation were detected in all 12 patients, GGO in 9/12 patients, nodules in 6/12 patients, consolidation in 6/12 patients, hilar lymphadenopathy in 3/12 patients, and pleural effusion in 2/12 patients. CONCLUSION: Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common hematologic malignancy affected by influenza A (H1N1) virus. The left lung is affected more than the right one. The most common multidetector CT findings are unilateral or bilateral airway thickening and dilatation. Multidetector CT can be used for early and accurate assessment of pulmonary affection with influenza A H1N1 virus infection.","['El-Badrawy, Adel', 'Zeidan, Amany', 'Ebrahim, Mohamed A']","['El-Badrawy A', 'Zeidan A', 'Ebrahim MA']","['Department of Radiology, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt. adelelbadrawy@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120625,England,Acta Radiol,"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",8706123,,2012/06/27 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ar.2012.120038 [pii]', '10.1258/ar.2012.120038 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Radiol. 2012 Jul;53(6):662-7. doi: 10.1258/ar.2012.120038.

Among 45 relapse patients from the ATRA/chemotherapy arm of intergroup protocol C9710, 18 patients harbored PRalpha/LBD+ (40%), 7 of whom (39%) relapsed Off-ATRA selection pressure, suggesting a possible active role of PRalpha/LBD+. Of 41 relapse patients coanalyzed, 15 (37%) had FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD+), which were differentially associated with PRalpha/LBD+ depending on ATRA treatment status at relapse: positively, On-ATRA; negatively, Off-ATRA. Thirteen of 21 patients (62%) had additional chromosome abnormalities (ACAs); all coanalyzed PRalpha/LBD mutant patients who relapsed off-ATRA (n = 5) had associated ACA. After relapse Off-ATRA, ACA and FLT3-ITD+ were negatively associated and were oppositely associated with presenting white blood count and PML-RARalpha type: ACA, low, L-isoform; FLT3-ITD+, high, S-isoform. These exploratory results suggest that differing PRalpha/LBD+ activities may interact with FLT3-ITD+ or ACA, that FLT3-ITD+ and ACA are associated with different intrinsic disease progression pathways manifest at relapse Off-ATRA, and that these different pathways may be short-circuited by ATRA-selectable defects at relapse On-ATRA.

To date, the incidence of vertebral fractures during ALL treatment has not been reported. PATIENT AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 155 children with ALL during the first 12 months of leukemia therapy. Lateral thoracolumbar spine radiographs were obtained at baseline and 12 months. Vertebral bodies were assessed for incident vertebral fractures using the Genant semiquantitative method, and relevant clinical indices such as spine bone mineral density (BMD), back pain, and the presence of vertebral fractures at baseline were analyzed for association with incident vertebral fractures. RESULTS: Of the 155 children, 25 (16%; 95% CI, 11% to 23%) had a total of 61 incident vertebral fractures, of which 32 (52%) were moderate or severe. Thirteen (52%) of the 25 children with incident vertebral fractures also had fractures at baseline. Vertebral fractures at baseline increased the odds of an incident fracture at 12 months by an odds ratio of 7.3 (95% CI, 2.3 to 23.1; P = .001). In addition, for every one standard deviation reduction in spine BMD Z-score at baseline, there was 1.8-fold increased odds of incident vertebral fracture at 12 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.7; P = .006).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In stage one of the study, eight patients with a slow early response (SER) by prednisone poor response (PPR; >/= 1,000 peripheral blood blasts on day 8 of prednisone prephase) received chemotherapy plus six courses of nelarabine 400 mg/m(2) once per day; four patients with SER by high minimal residual disease (MRD; >/= 1% at day 36 of induction) received chemotherapy plus five courses of nelarabine; 16 patients with a rapid early response (RER) received chemotherapy without nelarabine. In stage two, all patients received six 5-day courses of nelarabine at 650 mg/m(2) once per day (10 SER patients [one by MRD, nine by PPR]) or 400 mg/m(2) once per day (38 RER patients; 12 SER patients [three by MRD, nine by PPR]). RESULTS: The only significant difference in toxicities was decreased neutropenic infections in patients treated with nelarabine (42% with v 81% without nelarabine). Five-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 73% for 11 stage one SER patients and 67% for 22 stage two SER patients treated with nelarabine versus 69% for 16 stage one RER patients treated without nelarabine and 74% for 38 stage two RER patients treated with nelarabine. Five-year EFS for all patients receiving nelarabine (n = 70) was 73% versus 69% for those treated without nelarabine (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Addition of nelarabine to a BFM 86-based chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and produced encouraging results in pediatric patients with T-ALL, particularly those with a SER, who have historically fared poorly.","['Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Linda, Stephen B', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Camitta, Bruce M']","['Dunsmore KP', 'Devidas M', 'Linda SB', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Winick N', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Camitta BM']","['University of Virginia Health System, Box 800386, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA. kpd6u@virginia.edu']",['eng'],"['CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000064/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA086011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA029139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120625,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC3402886,2012/06/27 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.40.8724 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.40.8724 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Aug 1;30(22):2753-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.40.8724.

Several novel molecular genetic aberrations in FLT3 and NPM1 have been shown to have a prognostic impact in AML, particularly in those having normal karyotype. Though there is substantial amount of data on these mutations from western literature, there is surprisingly little data from Indian subcontinent on the frequency of this mutation in AML patients from India. The present study screens a large cohort of non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) AML patients (207 patients) for the presence of FLT3 and NPM1 mutations and further correlates with cytogenetics, immunophenotypic characteristics and with follow-up data wherever available. During the course of study, 56 APL patients were also studied. Briefly, both FLT3 (internal tandem duplication (ITD) in 19.4% and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in 9%) and NPM1 mutations were detected in 28.4% of the total non-APL AML patients screened showing distinct correlations with hematologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetics characteristics and follow-up. With regards to adult APL patients, 22.2 and 32.6% of the patients showed FLT3 and NPM1 mutation, respectively. In the pediatrics age group (<15 years), 23 and 16% of patients with APL showed FLT3 and NPM1 mutation, respectively, while in non-APL patient is this age group, 23% of patients showed both FLT3 and NPM1 mutation. NPM1 mutation was distinctly uncommon in younger age group of patients. In contrast to report elsewhere, most of our FLT3 mutation was in exon 11 rather than in exon 12. FLT3 mutation due to ITD or TKD mutation was detected in 2:1 ratio in our patients and a new TKD mutation was also detected S840G in an M5 patient who did not go into remission and had a short survival of 3 months from diagnosis. Generally, patients with NPM1 mutation had a very high white cell count but they went into remission more often than those with wild (Wt)-type allele (written as NPM1- and FLT3-, respectively) and FLT3 mutation. These patients also tended to have significantly lower expression of CD34 antigen on flowcytometry. Distinct prognostic subclasses of adult AML patients were identified based on the presence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations.","['Ghosh, Kanjaksha', 'Swaminathan, Suchitra', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Gupta, Maya', 'Kerketta, Lily', 'Vundinti, Baburao']","['Ghosh K', 'Swaminathan S', 'Madkaikar M', 'Gupta M', 'Kerketta L', 'Vundinti B']","['Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th Floor NMS building, KEM Hospital Campus, Parel, Mumbai, 400 012, India. kanjakshaghosh@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120626,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2012/06/27 06:00,2013/01/10 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1509-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Nov;91(11):1703-12. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1509-z.

Its frequent relapse following achievement of clinical remissions implicates the existence of therapy-resistant myeloma-initiating cells. To date, results on the identity of myeloma-initiating cells have differed. Here, we prospectively identified a myeloma-initiating population by fractionating and transplanting patient bone marrow cells into human bone-bearing immunocompromised mice. Xenotransplantation of fractionated CD138(+)/CD38(high) cells from 40% of patients (8/20) led to a repopulation of CD19(+)CD38(low) or CD138(+)CD38(+) B-lineage cells in human bone grafts; and these grafts were clonally derived from patient myeloma cells. Meanwhile, CD19(+)CD38(low) xenografts were detected in human bone-bearing mice transplanted with CD19(+)CD38(low/-) B cells from 8 of 22 samples but were not clonally related to patient myeloma cells. Further fractionation and xenotransplantation of CD138(+)CD38(high) cells demonstrated that (CD45(low/-) or CD19(-)) CD38(high)/CD138(+) plasma cells, but not (CD45(high) or CD19(+)) CD38(high)/CD138(+) plasmablasts enrich for myeloma-initiating cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of two serially transplantable xenografts, which were CD19(-)CD138(+), revealed that they were Pax5 (a B-cell-specific transactivator)-negative. These results suggest that CD19(-)CD45(low/-) fully differentiated plasma cells enrich for long-lived and tumor-initiating cells whereas B cells or plasmablasts do not.","['Kim, D', 'Park, C Y', 'Medeiros, B C', 'Weissman, I L']","['Kim D', 'Park CY', 'Medeiros BC', 'Weissman IL']","['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. kimdk1@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/27 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012140 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2530-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.140.

The present study was designed to assess the impact of these genetic variations on the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: We first investigated ten single nucleotide polymorphisms in six genes, CD28, inducible co-stimulator, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, granzyme B, Fas and Fas ligand, in 138 pairs of patients and their unrelated donors and a second cohort of 102 pairs of patients and their HLA-identical sibling donors. RESULTS: We observed that patients receiving stem cells from a donor with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene CT60 variant allele (AA genotype) had a reduced incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease; however, they experienced early cytomegalovirus infection and relapsed more frequently, which suggested an interaction between the donor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene CT60 AA genotype and reduced T-cell alloreactivity. Furthermore, an unrelated donor with the granzyme B +55 variant genotype (AA) was an independent risk factor for development of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (P=0.024, RR=1.811). Among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, those with the Fas -670 TT genotype were at higher risk of relapse (P=0.003, RR=3.823). The presence of these susceptible alleles in the donor and/or patient resulted in worse overall survival (54.9% versus 69.5%, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that genotype analysis of T-cell activation and effector pathway genes can be used for risk assessment for patients with hematologic malignancies before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Xiao, Haowen', 'Luo, Yi', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Fu, Shan', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Tan, Yamin', 'He, Jingsong', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Zheng, Weiyan', 'Wang, Li-Mengmeng', 'Zhang, Lifei', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Lin, Maofang', 'Huang, He']","['Xiao H', 'Luo Y', 'Lai X', 'Fu S', 'Shi J', 'Tan Y', 'He J', 'Xie W', 'Zheng W', 'Wang LM', 'Zhang L', 'Liu L', 'Ye X', 'Yu X', 'Cai Z', 'Lin M', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120624,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3590086,2012/06/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.066159 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.066159 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Dec;97(12):1804-12. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.066159.

A phase II trial of flavopiridol followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone with flavopiridol given by 1-h bolus for adults with newly-diagnosed, poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia yielded 67% complete remission with median disease-free survival of 13.6 months. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared bolus flavopiridol (50 mg/m(2)/day, Arm A) versus 'hybrid' flavopiridol (30 mg/m(2) over 30 min followed by 40 mg/m(2) over 4 h, Arm B) followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone in 78 patients (39 per arm) with newly diagnosed, poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia. To mitigate imbalance, patients were stratified by presence or absence of secondary leukemia and therapy for antecedent disorder. RESULTS: Death at or before Day 60 occurred in 8% of patients per arm. Complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete recovery was 68% (Arm A, 62%; Arm B, 74%) overall, and 65% or over in both arms for patients with secondary leukemia and leukemia with adverse genetics. In Arm A 91% and in Arm B 86% of patients received chemotherapy and/or allogeneic transplantation in complete remission. Median overall survival for all remission patients has not been reached for either arm, with median disease free survival of 13.6 months for Arm A and of 12.0 months for Arm B. CONCLUSIONS: Both flavopiridol schedules produce comparably encouraging results in adults with poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia. Given the greater ease of bolus administration, we are conducting a randomized phase II study of bolus flavopiridol followed by ara-c and mitoxantrone versus conventional induction therapy for patients aged 70 years and under with intermediate or poor-risk acute myelogenous leukemia.

In this study potential differences between these alternative TEL-JAK2 fusions, including their lineage specificity, were investigated. DESIGN AND METHODS: TEL-JAK2 fusion types derived from both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia were generated using the corresponding zebrafish tel and jak2a genes and placed under the control of either the white blood cell-specific spi1 promoter or the ubiquitously-expressed cytomegalovirus promoter. These constructs were injected into zebrafish embryos and their effects on hematopoiesis examined using a range of molecular approaches. In addition, the functional properties of the alternative fusions were investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Injection of the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived tel-jak2a significantly perturbed lymphopoiesis with a lesser effect on myelopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. In contrast, injection of the atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived tel-jak2a resulted in significant perturbation of the myeloid compartment. These phenotypes were observed regardless of whether expressed in a white blood cell-specific or ubiquitous manner, with no overt cellular proliferation outside of the hematopoietic cells. Functional studies revealed subtle differences between the alternative forms, with the acute lymphoblastic leukemia variant showing higher activity, but reduced downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription activation and decreased sensitivity to JAK2 inhibition. JAK2 activity was required to mediate the effects of both variants on zebrafish hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the molecular structure of alternative TEL-JAK2 fusions likely contributes to the etiology of disease. The data further suggest that this class of oncogene exerts its effects in a cell lineage-specific manner, which may be due to differences in downstream signaling.","['Onnebo, Sara M N', 'Rasighaemi, Parisa', 'Kumar, Janani', 'Liongue, Clifford', 'Ward, Alister C']","['Onnebo SM', 'Rasighaemi P', 'Kumar J', 'Liongue C', 'Ward AC']","['School of Life & Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120624,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3685286,2012/06/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.064659 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.064659 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Dec;97(12):1895-903. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.064659.

It investigates some specific mothers' resource factors such as their strategies of coping and the perception of their own family functioning in terms of cohesion and adaptability. The study was performed with 34 mothers of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), during the treatment phase. The used tools were the Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced--New Italian Version, to investigate coping strategies, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-III, to analyze both real and ideal perception of family functioning. The data related to coping, show how the involved mothers tend to mainly use the strategies of positive aptitude, orientation toward problem and social support (F = 99.88, df = 4, P < .01). The family functioning, in terms of adaptability, is described as chaotic relating to both the real (chi(2) = 13.29, df = 3, P = .004) and ideal (chi(2) = 11.52, df = 2, P = .003) family, whereas in terms of cohesion, it is perceived as chiefly disengaged in the real family (chi(2) = 12.3, df = 3, P = .006) and as enmeshed in the ideal one (chi(2) = 12.58, df = 3, P = .006).

We intend to explore the prevalence of CEBPA mutations and evaluate the efficacy of fragment and sequencing analysis methods for CEBPA mutation detection in Indian AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The coding region of the CEBPA gene was screened in 36 normal karyotype AML patients by fragment analysis and direct sequencing. RESULTS: We identified five CEBPA sequence variations in three patient samples (8.3%) by direct sequencing analysis, of which three were novel mutations. These mutations were clustered mostly in the TAD1 and basic region leucine zipper region of the CEBPA protein. Six cases demonstrated a previously reported polymorphism. Two of the three positive cases showed double mutations, and one case had a single mutation. All five mutations were also detected by fragment analysis, indicating a sensitivity of 100% (5/5). No correlation with clinical parameters including age, sex, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count between patients with and without mutation was observed. Interestingly, CEBPA mutations were significantly higher in patients with WT1 mutation, while no correlation with FLT3 and NPM1 was observed. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time the frequency of CEBPA mutation from an Indian patients (8.3%). The identification of novel CEBPA mutations added new insights into the genetic heterogeneity of AML. Our result suggests that the optimal approach for detecting CEBPA mutations in AML can be a combination of fragment analysis and direct sequencing.","['Ahmad, Firoz', 'Rajput, Saket', 'Mandava, Swarna', 'Das, Bibhu Ranjan']","['Ahmad F', 'Rajput S', 'Mandava S', 'Das BR']","['Research and Development Division, Super Religare Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120625,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,,2012/06/27 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2011.0317 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2012 Jul;16(7):707-15. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2011.0317.

METHODS: 34 CML patients after imatinib failure or intolerance received oral administration of 400 mg nilotinib twice daily. The median follow-up duration of nilotinib therapy was 14 (1.5-50) months. ABL kinase domain point mutations were detected from bone marrow of CML patients at baseline and once every 6 months before and after nilotinib therapy. Hematologic, cytogenetic, molecular response and progression were evaluated respectively at the same time. RESULTS: Among 34 patients, 13 were in chronic phase (CP), 11 were in accelerated phase (AP), 10 were in blastic crisis (BC). Major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 70% of patients with CP, 30% of patients with AP and BC (P = 0.027). Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved in 70% of patients with CP and 20% of patients with AP and BP, respectively (P = 0.005). The 4-year progressive free survival of patients with CP and AP was (81.8 +/- 11.6)% and (20.5 +/- 12.9)%, respectively (P < 0.01). The cases of ABL kinase domain point mutations at baseline was 17 (50%). CHR was achieved in 56%, MCyR in 43%, CCyR in 37%, MMR in 31% of patients with baseline mutations versus 59% (P > 0.05), 53% (P > 0.05), 41% (P > 0.05), 18% (P > 0.05), respectively, of patients without baseline mutations. The CHR, MCyR, CCyR and MMR in patients who harbored mutations with high sensitivity to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 < or = 150 nmol/L) or mutations with unknown nilotinib sensitivity in vitro were equivalent to those responses in patients without mutations. Patients with mutations less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nmol/L, Y253H, F359V/C, T315I) achieved 17% of CHR and MCyR, none of them (6 cases) achieved CCyR, and 6 cases had disease progression within 24 mouth after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib is a more effective option for imatinib-resistant or-intolerant CML patients. Response for patients with CP was better than patients with AP and BC. Mutational status at baseline may influence response. Less sensitive mutations may be associated with less favorable responses to nilotinib.","['Jiang, Hao', 'Chen, Shan-Shan', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Jiang H', 'Chen SS', 'Jiang B', 'Jiang Q', 'Qin YZ', 'Lai YY', 'Liu YR', 'Huang XJ']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beging 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2012/06/27 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/06/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Feb;33(2):123-6.,20130318,,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An EL4 leukemia allo-BMT model was established with the BALB/c (H-2d) donor mice (DM)and C57BL/6 (H-2b) recipient mice (RM). The RM received DM bone marrow (BM) cells at a 1:1 ratio with spleen cells intravenously via tail vein at 4 h after TBI. Fifty DM were separated randomly into five groups: (1) Group A: total body irradiation (TBI) group, (2) Group B: lymphoma cell leukemia group, (3) Group C: allo-BMT group, (4) Group D: pXZ9-DC group, (5) Group E: sTNFR I-DC group. Acute GVHD scores, incidence of leukemic cell infiltration, histopathological analysis, survival rate, and survival rate of the recipients were estimated after allo-BMT. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to detect cytokines (INF-gamma and IL-4 ) production. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis was used to detect allogeneic chimerism. RESULTS: (1) The mice in group A and group B all died of the BM failure and lymphoma cell leukemia, respectively. The mice in group C developed typical clinical signs of a GVHD after BMT with an average survival time(AST) of (11.50 +/- 3.50) d. The signs of aGVHD were less evident in the group D and E, and their AST (21.70 +/- 5.80 and 25.80 +/- 5.20 days, respectively) were all longer than that in group C (P < 0.05). AST of group E was the longest (P < 0.05). The mice in group B all died of leukemia within 18 days after engraftment of EL4 cells. There was was no significant difference in groups C, D and E in the incidence of leukemia (P > 0.05). (2) Serum IFN-gamma level reached peak value. At + 12 d, then decreased gradually in group C, D, and E, and then reached the nadir at +18 d post-BMT, with the lowest in group E (P < 0.05), and the level was significantly lower in group D than in group C (P < 0.05). After BMT, serum IL-4 level slightly decreased in group C, but gradually elevated in group D and E and reached their peak at +12 d, and even more significantly increased in group E (P < 0.05).

METHODS: From January 2007 and January 2008 MRD were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) in 402 bone marrow (BM) in 102 AL patients without leukemic gene and chromosomal changes at first diagnosis after HSCT (1, 2, 3, 6,12 months after HSCT; adding detection frequency in part of high risk patients), The relationship between the MRD results and clinical prognosis were observed. Patients with significantly higher MRD were treated and the effectiveness was monitored by FCM (MRD > 0.01% considered as positive). RESULTS: (1) 71 cases were persistently negative for MRD after HSCT and all them were in hematologic complete remission (CR). Only 3 cases had extramedullary relapse. The disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 66.2% and 90.1%, respectively. (2) Of 27 MRD(+) cases 11 converted to MRD negativity after chemotherapy plus donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), CIK, NK cells. The DFS and OS were 63.6% and 72.7%, respectively.

Their role in human conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is unknown. Here, we analyzed the post-HSCT recovery of iNKT cells in 71 adult allografted patients. Results were compared with conventional T- and NK-cell recovery and correlated to the occurrence of GVHD, relapse, and survival. We observed that posttransplantation iNKT cells, likely of donor origin, recovered independently of T and NK cells in the first 90 days after HSCT and reached greater levels in recipient younger than 45 years (P = .003) and after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (P = .03). Low posttransplantation iNKT/T ratios (ie, < 10(-3)) were an independent factor associated with the occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD; P = .001). Inversely, reaching iNKT/T ratios > 10(-3) before day 90 was associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality (P = .009) without increased risk of relapse and appeared as an independent predictive factor of an improved overall survival (P = .028). Furthermore, an iNKT/T ratio on day 15 > 0.58 x 10(-3) was associated with a 94% risk reduction of aGVHD.

However, malignant cells employ mechanisms to evade NKG2D-mediated immunosurveillance, such as NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) shedding resulting in reduced surface expression levels. In addition, systemic downregulation of NKG2D on NK cells of cancer patients has been observed in many studies and was attributed to soluble NKG2DL (sNKG2DL), although there also are conflicting data. Likewise, relevant expression of NKG2DL in leukemia has been reported by some, but not all studies. Hence, we comprehensively studied expression, release, and function of the NKG2D ligands MHC class I chain-related molecules A and B and UL16-binding proteins 1-3 in 205 leukemia patients. Leukemia cells of most patients (75%) expressed at least one NKG2DL at the surface, and all investigated patient sera contained elevated sNKG2DL levels. Besides correlating NKG2DL levels with clinical data and outcome, we demonstrate that sNKG2DL in patient sera reduce NKG2D expression on NK cells, resulting in impaired antileukemia reactivity, which also critically depends on number and levels of surface-expressed NKG2DL. Together, we provide comprehensive data on the relevance of NKG2D/NKG2DL expression, release, and function for NK reactivity in leukemia, which exemplifies the mechanisms underlying NKG2D-mediated tumor immunosurveillance and escape.","['Hilpert, Julia', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Buechele, Corina', 'Nuebling, Tina', 'Raum, Tobias', 'Steinle, Alexander', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer']","['Hilpert J', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Grunebach F', 'Buechele C', 'Nuebling T', 'Raum T', 'Steinle A', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, D-72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120622,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200796 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200796 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Aug 1;189(3):1360-71. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200796.

OBJECTIVE: We report a unique case of hypercalcemia associated with post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis and review the clinical and laboratory features, pathogenesis, and responsiveness to treatment with the bone antiresorptive agent, denosumab. RESULTS: A 62-yr-old woman with essential thrombocythemia presented with progression to myelofibrosis with lytic skull lesions and symptomatic hypercalcemia. Other causes of hypercalcemia were excluded. Her disturbance in calcium homeostasis was not PTH- or vitamin D-mediated, although this has been postulated in cases of hypercalcemia with the related entity of primary myelofibrosis. Her hypercalcemia was refractory to aggressive iv saline administration, furosemide, calcitonin, and pamidronate, but promptly improved after one 120-mg sc dose of the anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK) ligand monoclonal antibody, denosumab, with sustained normocalcemia for approximately 2 months. She died 6 months later from complications due to the leukemic transformation of her hematological disease. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of myelofibrosis-related hypercalcemia could be due to multiple factors, particularly changes in the RANK ligand-RANK-osteoprotegerin system that lead to increased osteoclast activity. Although we did not measure these factors, denosumab holds promise in the treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and specifically that related to myelofibrosis. Hypercalcemia associated with myelofibrosis is rare, and its pathogenesis and treatment are not known.","['Khoury, Nadia', 'Chang, Julietta', 'Gru, Alejandro A', 'Whyte, Michael P']","['Khoury N', 'Chang J', 'Gru AA', 'Whyte MP']","['Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Washington University School of Medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120622,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2012-1792 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2012-1792 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2012 Sep;97(9):3051-5. doi: 10.1210/jc.2012-1792.

Induction of cell survival involves a non-proteolytic mechanism and the proMMP-9 hemopexin domain (PEX9). To help design specific inhibitors of proMMP-9-cell binding, we have now characterized B-CLL cell interaction with the isolated PEX9. B-CLL cells bound soluble and immobilized GST-PEX9, but not GST, and binding was mediated by alpha4beta1 integrin. The ability to recognize PEX9 was observed in all 20 primary samples studied irrespective of their clinical stage or prognostic marker phenotype. By preparing truncated forms of GST-PEX9 containing structural blades B1B2 or B3B4, we have identified B3B4 as the primary alpha4beta1 integrin-interacting region within PEX9. Overlapping synthetic peptides spanning B3B4 were then tested in functional assays. Peptide P3 (FPGVPLDTHDVFQYREKAYFC), a sequence present in B4 or smaller versions of this sequence (peptides P3a/P3b), inhibited B-CLL cell adhesion to GST-PEX9 or proMMP-9, with IC(50) values of 138 and 279 mum, respectively. Mutating the two aspartate residues to alanine rendered the peptides inactive. An anti-P3 antibody also inhibited adhesion to GST-PEX9 and proMMP-9. GST-PEX9, GST-B3B4, and P3/P3a/P3b peptides inhibited B-CLL cell transendothelial migration, whereas the mutated peptide did not. B-CLL cell incubation with GST-PEX9 induced intracellular survival signals, namely Lyn phosphorylation and Mcl-1 up-regulation, and this was also prevented by the P3 peptides. The P3 sequence may, therefore, constitute an excellent target to prevent proMMP-9 contribution to B-CLL pathogenesis.","['Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Vituri, Cidonia L', 'del Cerro, Mercedes Hernandez', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Albar, Juan P', 'Rivas, German', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Bailon E', 'Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Vituri CL', 'del Cerro MH', 'Terol MJ', 'Albar JP', 'Rivas G', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120622,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3431623,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47784-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.354670 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 10;287(33):27601-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.354670.

The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the As(2)O(3)-induced inactivation of the cdc2 and possible functional role of PTEN in the observed G2/M arrest has yet to be elucidated. Here, we assessed the role of PTEN in regulation of As(2)O(3)-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest in Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC7721). After 24 h following treatment, As(2)O(3) induced a concentration-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The sustained G2/M arrest by As(2)O(3) is associated with decreased cdc2 protein and increased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15). As(2)O(3) treatment increased Wee1 levels and decreased phospho-Wee1(642). Moreover, As(2)O(3) substantially decreased the Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt and upregulated PTEN expression. Downregulation of PTEN by siRNA in As(2)O(3) -treated cells increased phospho-Wee1(Ser642) while decreased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15), resulting in decreased the G2/M cell cycle arrest. Therefore, induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest by As(2)O(3) involved upregulation of PTEN.","['Zhang, Xinyu', 'Jia, Shuzhao', 'Yang, Shumeng', 'Yang, Yue', 'Yang, Tuoyun', 'Yang, Yanmei']","['Zhang X', 'Jia S', 'Yang S', 'Yang Y', 'Yang T', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24230 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Nov;113(11):3528-35. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24230.,20130204,10.1002/jcb.24230 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: High BMI1 expression was detected in 11.7% of glottic tumors and in 50% of supraglottic tumors. No significant differences were observed in the patients' clinical data after they were stratified by the tumor expression of p16. The expression of nuclear BMI1 in the absence of p16 immunoreactivity correlated significantly with the pN status of the primary tumors.

In multivariable analysis, the ALC on day 28 (<350 cells/muL vs. >/=350 cells/muL, P </= .0004 for OS and EFS) along with WBC at diagnosis (</=6.0 or >30.0 K/muL vs. >6.0-30.0 K/muL, P </= 0.002 for OS and EFS) and cytogenetics (abnormal vs. normal, P = 0.002 for OS and P = 0.02 for EFS) were independent prognostic factors of both OS and EFS. Combining these three factors segregates patients in three well-defined risk groups. These data suggest that ALC can be used in combination with other prognostic features to better predict outcome and that targeting the immune system to improve ALC may be a worthwhile strategy in ALL.","['Sun, Di', 'Elson, Paul', 'Liedtke, Michaela', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Earl, Marc', 'Alizadeh, Ash', 'Bates, Jennifer', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Advani, Anjali S']","['Sun D', 'Elson P', 'Liedtke M', 'Medeiros BC', 'Earl M', 'Alizadeh A', 'Bates J', 'Sekeres MA', 'Coutre S', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sobecks R', 'Copelan E', 'Advani AS']","['Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20120622,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23279 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Oct;87(10):957-60. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23279.

Here, we extend these analyses to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: Three strategies to assess study quality (stratification by the year-of-start of follow-up, stratification by the strength of the reported acute myeloid leukemia (AML) association, and stratification by the quality of benzene exposure assessment) were employed in a meta-analysis of occupational benzene exposure and CML. We hypothesized that stratification by these study quality dimensions would identify a subgroup of occupational cohort studies that is most informative for the evaluation of the possible association between benzene and CML. RESULTS: The overall meta-relative risk (mRR) was non-significantly elevated (1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.63). The mRRs increased with increasing study quality for all dimensions with a significant elevation for studies with start of follow-up after 1970 (1.67; 95% CI: 1.02-2.74). The highest study quality stratum for AML significance and exposure quality showed an elevated but non-significant increased mRR (1.40; 95% CI: 0.86-2.27, and 1.68; 95% CI: 0.74-3.84, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by low statistical power, the current meta-analysis provides support for a possible association of occupational exposure to benzene and the risk of CML.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Lan, Qing', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Lan Q', 'Kromhout H', 'Rothman N', 'Vermeulen R']","['Division of Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajim.22087 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2012 Sep;55(9):779-85. doi: 10.1002/ajim.22087.

In addition to respirable dust and quartz, phenol, formaldehyde, furfuryl alcohols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon black, isocyanates and asbestos are used or generated by foundry production techniques and exposure to any of these substances could have potentially carcinogenic effects. METHODS: Cancer morbidity between 1958 and 2004 was evaluated in a cohort of 3,045 male foundry workers employed for >1 year between 1913 and 2005. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were determined by comparing observed numbers of incident cancers with frequencies in the Swedish cancer register. Exposure measures were assessed using information from the personal files of employees and modelling quartz measurement based on a database of 1,667 quartz measurements. Dose responses for lung cancer were determined for duration of employment and cumulative quartz exposure for latency periods >20 years. RESULTS: Overall cancer morbidity was not increased amongst the foundry workers (SIR 1.00; 95 % CI, 0.90-1.11), but the incidence of lung cancer was significantly elevated (SIR 1.61; 95 % CI, 1.20-2.12). A non-significant negative dose response was determined using external comparison with a latency period of >20 years (SIR 2.05, 1.72 1.26 for the low, medium and high exposure groups), supported by internal comparison data (hazard ratios 1, 1.01, 0.78) for the corresponding groups. For cancers at sites with at least five observed cases and a SIR > 1.25, non-significant risks with SIRs > 1.5 were determined for cancers of the liver, larynx, testis, connective muscle tissue, multiple myeloma plasmacytoma and lymphatic leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: A significant overall risk of lung cancer was determined, but using external and internal comparison groups could not confirm any dose response at our cumulative quartz dose levels.","['Westberg, Hakan', 'Andersson, Lena', 'Bryngelsson, Ing-Liss', 'Ngo, Yen', 'Ohlson, Carl-Goran']","['Westberg H', 'Andersson L', 'Bryngelsson IL', 'Ngo Y', 'Ohlson CG']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Orebro University Hospital, 701 85, Orebro, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,2012/06/26 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00420-012-0782-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2013 Jul;86(5):499-507. doi: 10.1007/s00420-012-0782-4.

It causes leukaemia and nasopharyngeal cancer, and was described to regularly occur in alcoholic beverages. However, its risk associated with consumption of alcohol has not been systematically studied, so this study will provide the first risk assessment of formaldehyde for consumers of alcoholic beverages.Human dietary intake of formaldehyde via alcoholic beverages in the European Union was estimated based on WHO alcohol consumption data and literature on formaldehyde contents of different beverage groups (beer, wine, spirits, and unrecorded alcohol). The risk assessment was conducted using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach with benchmark doses (BMD) for 10 % effect obtained from dose-response modelling of animal experiments.For tumours in male rats, a BMD of 30 mg kg(-1) body weight per day and a ""BMD lower confidence limit"" (BMDL) of 23 mg kg(-1) d(-1) were calculated from available long-term animal experiments. The average human exposure to formaldehyde from alcoholic beverages was estimated at 8.10(-5) mg kg(-1) d(-1). Comparing the human exposure with BMDL, the resulting MOE was above 200,000 for average scenarios. Even in the worst-case scenarios, the MOE was never below 10,000, which is considered to be the threshold for public health concerns.The risk assessment shows that the cancer risk from formaldehyde to the alcohol-consuming population is negligible and the priority for risk management (e.g. to reduce the contamination) is very low. The major risk in alcoholic beverages derives from ethanol and acetaldehyde.","['Monakhova, Yulia B', 'Jendral, Julien A', 'Lachenmeier, Dirk W']","['Monakhova YB', 'Jendral JA', 'Lachenmeier DW']","['Department of Chemistry, Saratov State University, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Croatia,Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,0373100,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['T263835608K07452 [pii]', '10.2478/10004-1254-63-2012-2201 [doi]']",ppublish,Arh Hig Rada Toksikol. 2012 Jun 1;63(2):227-37. doi: 10.2478/10004-1254-63-2012-2201.,20121123,10.2478/10004-1254-63-2012-2201 [doi],,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Alcoholic Beverages/*analysis', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/*analysis/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Formaldehyde/*analysis/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Risk Assessment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite these advances, our understanding of the dynamic regulation of the methylome remains poor. We have attempted to address this shortcoming by producing a dynamic, six-compartmental model of DNA methylation levels based on the activity of the Dnmt methyltransferase proteins. In addition, the model incorporates the recently discovered Tet family proteins which enzymatically convert methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine. A set of first order, partial differential equations comprise the model and were solved via numerical integration. The model is able to predict the relative abundances of unmethylated, hemimethylated, fully methylated, and hydroxymethylated CpG dyads in the DNA of cells with fully functional Dnmt and Tet proteins. In addition, the model accurately predicts the experimentally measured changes in these abundances with disruption of Dnmt function. Furthermore, the model reveals the mechanism whereby CpG islands are maintained in a hypomethylated state via local modulation of Dnmt and Tet activities without any requirement for active demethylation. We conclude that this model provides an accurate depiction of the major epigenetic processes involving modification of DNA.","['McGovern, Andrew P', 'Powell, Benjamin E', 'Chevassut, Timothy J T']","['McGovern AP', 'Powell BE', 'Chevassut TJ']","['Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120620,England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5193(12)00305-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2012 Oct 7;310:14-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.018.

We studied the role of CMV infection in cytopenias after SDCT for childhood ALL or NHL. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Pediatric Oncology Unit. METHODS: Between January 2007 and March 2010, we screened all children having ALL/NHL having prolonged cytopenia (ANC<1,000/cmm and/or platelets <1,00,000/cmm; >10 days beyond date for next chemotherapy; not explainable on basis of previously administered chemotherapy) for CMV infection. Testing for CMV infection was done by pp65 antigen assay, qualitative or quantitative RT-PCR. CMV positive episodes were analyzed for relationship to previous chemotherapy, clinical features and response to treatment. RESULTS: As defined, 24 episodes of cytopenia were identified. CMV infection was detected in 13/24 (54%) episodes in 9 patients. Duration of cytopenia in patients having CMV infection: 14-126 days (median 28 d). Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia were seen in 11/13 and 13/13 episodes, respectively. Fever (2-20 d) and loose motions (3-60 d) in 11/13 and 9/13 episodes, respectively. Eye examination records were available in 5 children; 3 had simultaneous or delayed chorioretinitis. Gancyclovir was used in all but 1 CMV-positive episode. In treated cases, counts recovered after a median of 8 days (3-56 d). CONCLUSION: Following chemotherapy for ALL/NHL, cytopenia that is prolonged or not explainable on the basis of chemotherapy toxicity should be evaluated for CMV infection.","['Kanvinde, Shailesh', 'Bhargava, Pallavi', 'Patwardhan, Sampada']","['Kanvinde S', 'Bhargava P', 'Patwardhan S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, India. skanvin@vsnl.net']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian Pediatr,Indian pediatrics,2985062R,,2012/06/26 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S097475591100788-1 [pii]', '10.1007/s13312-013-0066-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian Pediatr. 2013 Feb;50(2):197-201. doi: 10.1007/s13312-013-0066-4.,20140121,,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*blood/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/*etiology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,['Indian Pediatr. 2013 Feb;50(2):193-4.

Single institution experience.,385-94,"AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.","['Coco, I', 'Casale, F', 'Indolfi, P']","['Coco I', 'Casale F', 'Indolfi P']","['Service of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Second University of the Studies in Naples, Naples, Italy. ily.coco@alice.it']","['eng', 'ita']",,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/01/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['R15123641 [pii]'],ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2012 Aug;64(4):385-94.,20130109,,,,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Catheter-Related Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prevalence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission could not be achieved even after several induction chemotherapy regimens, and the patient suffered from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. He was transferred to our hospital and underwent reduced-intensity conditioning cord blood transplantation (RIC-CBT) in a non-remission state. The conditioning regimen involved fludarabine 125 mg/m2 combined with melphalan 140 mg/m2 and total body irradiation (4 Gy). GVHD prophylaxis was tacrolimus alone at relatively low concentrations (app. 5 ng/ml). On days 6 and 9 after CBT, he experienced a pre-engraftment immune reaction and hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). We started steroid pulse therapy, but this failed to resolve the symptoms. We then administered low-dose etoposide (50 mg/m2). The symptoms gradually resolved after three administrations of etoposide and engraftment was achieved on day 35. Satisfactory hematological recovery was noted on day 300 after CBT and the patient has maintained complete remission to date. HPS is one of the most serious complications following CBT and often results in engraftment failure.

However, some tumors and cancer cell lines are resistant to TRAIL. Here, the effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin on sensitization of human cervical cancer cells to TRAIL and the underlying mechanism(s) of the effect were explored. Combination treatment with aspirin and TRAIL markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and analysis of cell cycle sub-G1 phase. The two agents together activated the several caspases and mitochondrial signaling pathway. Whereas Mcl-1 protein level was increased and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 was activated in cells treated with TRAIL alone, combination treatment dramatically inhibited ERK1/2 activation and down-regulated Mcl-1 protein level. An inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation, PD98059, also augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Combination treatment with PD98059 and TRAIL showed the activation of caspases and mitochondrial pathway, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1 level. These results suggest that cancer cells can be sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by pre-treatment with aspirin via suppression of ERK1/2 activation. These findings provide a basis for further exploring the potential applications of this combination approach for the treatment of cancer, including cervical cancer.","['Im, Se-Ran', 'Jang, Young-Ju']","['Im SR', 'Jang YJ']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Medical Sciences, Ajou University School of Medicine, San 5, Woncheon-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon 443-721, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120620,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01162-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.067 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jul 20;424(1):65-70. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.067.

We have shown that lack of Eng results in reduced numbers of primitive erythroid colonies as well as downregulation of key hematopoietic genes. To determine the effect of Eng overexpression in hematopoietic development, we generated a doxycycline-inducible embryonic stem cell line. Our results demonstrate that induction of Eng during embryoid body differentiation leads to a significant increase in the frequency of hematopoietic progenitors, in particular, the erythroid lineage, which correlated with upregulation of Scl, Gata1, Runx1, and embryonic globin. Interestingly, activation of the hematopoietic program happened at the expense of endothelial and cardiac cells, as differentiation into these mesoderm lineages was compromised. Eng-induced enhanced erythroid activity was accompanied by high levels of Smad1 phosphorylation. This effect was attenuated by addition of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling inhibitor to these cultures. Among the BMPs, BMP4 is well known for its role in hematopoietic specification from mesoderm by promoting expression of several hematopoietic genes, including Scl. Because Scl is considered the master regulator of the hematopoietic program, we investigated whether Scl would be capable of rescuing the defective hematopoietic phenotype observed in Eng(-/-) embryonic stem cells. Scl expression in Eng-deficient embryonic stem cells resulted in increased erythroid colony-forming activity and upregulation of Gata1 and Gata2, positioning Eng upstream of Scl. Taken together, these findings support the premise that Eng modulates the hematopoietic transcriptional network, most likely through regulation of BMP4 signaling.","['Baik, June', 'Borges, Luciene', 'Magli, Alessandro', 'Thatava, Tayaramma', 'Perlingeiro, Rita C R']","['Baik J', 'Borges L', 'Magli A', 'Thatava T', 'Perlingeiro RC']","['Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR055299/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085840/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007612/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL100407/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120619,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,PMC3447113,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00233-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Oct;40(10):837-46. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.06.007.

It is a novel member of the BCL2 gene family, members of which are implicated in different hematological malignancies. In the present study, we investigated and studied the expression profile of BCL2L12 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 67 AML patients and healthy donors. The expression profile of BCL2L12 was studied using real-time PCR methodology (SYBR Green chemistry). We also evaluated the association of the BCL2L12 mRNA expression level with clinical and pathological disease parameters, as well with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), using the chi-square (chi(2)) test or the Fisher's exact test, where appropriate. RESULTS: Leukemia patients expressing high level of BCL2L12 were 3 times more likely to relapse (p=0.004) or die (p=0.007) than patients with low level of BCL2L12 expression. Additionally, statistically significant relationships were revealed between BCL2L12 expression level and CD117 expression, the presence of splenomegaly and chemotherapy response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that BCL2L12 can be considered as a new independent prognostic and chemotherapy response marker in AML.","['Thomadaki, Hellinida', 'Floros, Konstantinos V', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Gourgiotis, Dimitrios', 'Colovic, Milica', 'Scorilas, Andreas']","['Thomadaki H', 'Floros KV', 'Pavlovic S', 'Tosic N', 'Gourgiotis D', 'Colovic M', 'Scorilas A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(12)00306-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2012 Nov;45(16-17):1362-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.06.012.

In this study, we combined selenite treatment with modulators of sphingolipid metabolism in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7. Treatment with 20 muM of selenite reduced the viability of Huh7 cells by half and increased the levels of long chain C14-, C16-, C18- and C18:1- ceramides by two-fold. Inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase with 3-O-methylsphingosine significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of selenite. In line with this result, selenite caused a 2.5-fold increase in the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase. The sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) inhibitor 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SK1-II) sensitized the cells to the cytotoxic effects of selenite. Preincubation with 10 muM of SK1-II prior to treatment with 10 muM of selenite caused induction of apoptosis and gave rise to a 2.5-fold increase in C14-, C16-, C18- and C18:1- ceramides. Instead, 50 muM of SK1-II combined with 10 muM of selenite caused accumulation of cells in G1/S phases, but less apoptosis and accumulation of ceramides. The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after treatment with 10 muM of selenite was maximally enhanced by 1 muM of SK1-II. Moreover, combined treatment with SK1-II and 10 muM of selenite synergistically reduced the number of viable Huh7 cells, while the non-tumorigenic hepatocyte cell line MIHA remained unaffected by the same treatment. These results raise the possibility that a combination of selenite and SK1 inhibitors could be used to treat liver cancer cells, that are regarded as drug resistant, at doses that are non-toxic to normal liver cells.","['Chatzakos, V', 'Rundlof, A K', 'Ahmed, D', 'de Verdier, P J', 'Flygare, J']","['Chatzakos V', 'Rundlof AK', 'Ahmed D', 'de Verdier PJ', 'Flygare J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

Children from families affected by childhood leukaemia were monitored for 1 month for external gamma-radiation dose and for exposure to radon gas. 28 children from families in Kazakhstan and from 31 families in Kyrgyzstan were monitored. The median measured radon in air concentration recorded in Kazakhstan was 123 Bq m(-3) and in Kyrgyzstan was 177 Bq m(-3). These represent 24-h average indoor/outdoor values. In the case of the gamma-doses the mean annual dose was 1.2 mGy for Kazakhstan and 2.1 mGy for Kyrgyzstan.

Dysregulation of angiogenesis occurs in various pathologies and is one of the hallmarks for cancer. Recent emphasis on the microenvironment's influence in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression and drug resistance nurtures the interest in angiogenesis. Researchers have already identified a variety of angiogenic factors involved in the CLL, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiopoietin-2(Ang-2), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as well as extracellular proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Besides modulating neovascularization, angiogenic factors also participate in the regulation of pro-survival effects of CLL cells. However, the precise mechanism involved still needs to be elucidated further.

Since then several bortezomib-based combination therapies have emerged. Although some combinations have been preceded by preclinical investigations, most have followed the inevitable process in which active (or potentially active) drugs are combined with each other to create new treatment regimens. Regimens that have combined bortezomib with corticosteroids, alkylating agents, thalidomide, and/or lenalidomide have resulted in high response rates. Despite the higher and often deeper response rates and prolongation of progression-free survival with bortezomib-based multiagent regimens, an overall survival (OS) advantage has not been demonstrated with most combinations compared to the sequential approach of using anti-myeloma agents, particularly in patients less than 65 years of age with newly diagnosed myeloma. The unique properties of some of these regimens can be taken into account when choosing a particular regimen based on the clinical scenario. For example, the combination of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) has particular value in renal failure since none of the drugs need dose modification. Similarly, the combination chemotherapy regimen VDT-PACE (bortezomib, dexamethasone, thalidomide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide) is of particular value in patients presenting with aggressive disease such as extramedullary plasmacytomas or plasma cell leukemia. Ongoing clinical trials are testing combinations of bortezomib with several other classes of agents, including monoclonal antibodies, and inhibitors of deacetylases, heat shock proteins, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and farnesyl transferase.","['Kapoor, Prashant', 'Ramakrishnan, Vijay', 'Rajkumar, S Vincent']","['Kapoor P', 'Ramakrishnan V', 'Rajkumar SV']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA107476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,PMC3597231,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(12)00033-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2012.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2012 Jul;49(3):228-42. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2012.04.010.,20130610,10.1053/j.seminhematol.2012.04.010 [doi],,,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NIHMS380927'],['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Many reports show that Tax is capable of regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis both positively and negatively. However, it still remains to understand why the Tax oncoprotein induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, or whether Tax-induced apoptosis is dependent upon its ability to induce G1 arrest. The present study used time-lapse imaging to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of cell cycle dynamics in Tax-expressing HeLa cells containing the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, Fucci2. A large-scale host cell gene profiling approach was also used to identify the genes involved in Tax-mediated cell signaling events related to cellular proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Tax-expressing apoptotic cells showed a rounded morphology and detached from the culture dish after cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Thus, it appears that Tax induces apoptosis through pathways identical to those involved in G1 arrest. To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which Tax induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, regulation of host cellular genes by Tax was analyzed using a microarray containing approximately 18,400 human mRNA transcripts. Seventeen genes related to cell cycle regulation were identified as being up or downregulated > 2.0-fold in Tax-expressing cells. Several genes, including SMAD3, JUN, GADD45B, DUSP1 and IL8, were involved in cellular proliferation, responses to cellular stress and DNA damage, or inflammation and immune responses. Additionally, 23 pro- and anti-apoptotic genes were deregulated by Tax, including TNFAIP3, TNFRS9, BIRC3 and IL6. Furthermore, the kinetics of IL8, SMAD3, CDKN1A, GADD45A, GADD45B and IL6 expression were altered following the induction of Tax, and correlated closely with the morphological changes observed by time-lapse imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of this study permit a greater understanding of the biological events affected by HTLV-1 Tax, particularly the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Importantly, this study is the first to demonstrate the dynamics of morphological changes during Tax-induced apoptosis after cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.","['Arainga, Mariluz', 'Murakami, Hironobu', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Arainga M', 'Murakami H', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120622,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,PMC3537563,2012/06/26 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-275 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-275 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2012 Jun 22;13:275. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-275.,20130514,10.1186/1471-2164-13-275 [doi],,,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'G1 Phase', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Time-Lapse Imaging', 'Ubiquitination/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multivariable analyses, controlling for age, history of antecedent hematologic disorder, cytogenetic risk, and WBC at diagnosis, pSTAT5 expression was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.19-3.23, P = 0.008) and of relapse after achieving complete remission (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.16-4.63, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Validation of pSTAT5's prognostic value requires additional study in a larger group of uniformly treated patients. However, our data suggests that targeting this signaling pathway in AML may improve the outcome of patients.","['Brady, Anna', 'Gibson, Sarah', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Hsi, Eric', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Tiu, Ramon', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Bates, Jennifer', 'Advani, Anjali S']","['Brady A', 'Gibson S', 'Rybicki L', 'Hsi E', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Sekeres MA', 'Tiu R', 'Copelan E', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sobecks R', 'Bates J', 'Advani AS']","['Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120726,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01825.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Oct;89(4):288-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01825.x.

It represents a novel class of anticancer drugs and is currently in a Phase III clinical trial for relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and is increasing in incidence due to the aging of the American population. Despite advances in diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and treatment in younger age groups, there has been little improvement in survival among patients over 60 years of age, who make up the majority of those affected. AREAS COVERED: The development of vosaroxin, its mechanism of action, pharmacology, and metabolism, and the preclinical and clinical data to date will be covered. EXPERT OPINION: Despite its structural dissimilarity, vosaroxin has mechanisms of action similar to the anthracyclines and anthracenediones already in use for the treatment of AML. However, unlike these agents, vosaroxin is not a P-gp substrate, appears to be unaffected by overexpression of P-gp or TP53 mutations, and may be useful in the treatment of AML, especially in the elderly.","['Abbas, Jonathan A', 'Stuart, Robert K']","['Abbas JA', 'Stuart RK']","['Medical University of South Carolina, Hollings Cancer Center, 96 Jonathon Lucas St, MSC 635 CSB 903, Charleston, 29425, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120623,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.699038 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Aug;21(8):1223-33. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.699038.

So far, publications described only DCL arising de novo in the recipient. OBSERVATION: In this study, we describe a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) developing in a volunteer unrelated donor from the Czech National Marrow Donors Registry (CNMDR) several years after donation. From archival DNA sample, we have retrospectively found that subclinical CLL clone was already present at the time of donation but early death of recipient prevented eventual development of DCL. This case documents well the long period between detection of B-CLL clone and full development of clinical-laboratory symptomatology. The medical and ethical questions posed by an isolated case of detection of hematological malignancy present either only in the donor or only in the recipient are discussed. CONCLUSION: The case demonstrates the increasing risk of development of various forms of DCL and thus highlights the need for long-term monitoring of stem cell donor, not only in terms of health of donor but also in terms of potential risks for the recipient.","['Jindra, P', 'Zejskova, L', 'Pekova, S', 'Navratilova, J', 'Schutzova, M', 'Vokurka, S', 'Koza, V']","['Jindra P', 'Zejskova L', 'Pekova S', 'Navratilova J', 'Schutzova M', 'Vokurka S', 'Koza V']","['Hematologicko-onkologicke oddeleni, FN Plzen. jindra@fnplzen.cz']",['cze'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,,2012/06/26 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/06/26 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['38173 [pii]'],ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2012;25(3):212-5.,20120807,,,,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,,,,,,,,,,Pacient s B-CLL s anamnezou darovani krvetvornych bunek nepribuznemu pacientovi - retrospektivni sledovani vyvoje nemoci a dusledky pro prijemce.,,,,,

This was a prospective non-randomized study, analyzing by zymography and ELISA the in vitro effects of SDX on pro-enzyme, complexed, and active MMP forms in plasma and serum from 60 healthy donors, and in U-937 leukemia cell line. The levels and zymographic profile of MMP-2 did not show significant changes among samples and during SDX treatments. However, pro- and complexed forms of MMP-9 were strongly affected by SDX treatment (P<0.001), with significant decrease of MMP-9 secretion from white blood cells in a dose-dependent fashion (P<0.0001), without any displacement of MMP prodomains. The mechanism of reduced release of MMP-9 forms from leukocytes and inhibition of proteolytic activity due to SDX treatment may support the hypothesis that drugs based upon inhibitors of MMP-9 activity may provide a therapeutic tool for the underlying pathological destruction of extracellular matrix, and offering novel pharmacologic applications for chronic inflammatory vascular diseases, including varicose vein and chronic venous diseases associated with enhanced MMP activation in blood and limbs.","['Mannello, Ferdinando', 'Medda, Virginia', 'Ligi, Daniela', 'Raffetto, Joseph D']","['Mannello F', 'Medda V', 'Ligi D', 'Raffetto JD']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Section of Clinical Biochemistry, Unit of Cell Biology, University ""Carlo Bo"", Via O.

Here we used a strategy of parallel transcriptional analysis of phenotypic long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), short-term HSCs, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors from individuals with high-risk (-7/7q-) AML and compared them with the corresponding cell populations from healthy controls. This analysis revealed dysregulated expression of 11 genes, including IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), in all leukemic stem and progenitor cell compartments. IL1RAP protein was found to be overexpressed on the surface of HSCs of AML patients, and marked cells with the -7/7q- anomaly. IL1RAP was also overexpressed on HSCs of patients with normal karyotype AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting a pervasive role in different disease subtypes. High IL1RAP expression was independently associated with poor overall survival in 3 independent cohorts of AML patients (P = 2.2 x 10(-7)). Knockdown of IL1RAP decreased clonogenicity and increased cell death of AML cells. Our study identified genes dysregulated in stem and progenitor cells in -7/7q- AML, and suggests that IL1RAP may be a promising therapeutic and prognostic target in AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Barreyro, Laura', 'Will, Britta', 'Bartholdy, Boris', 'Zhou, Li', 'Todorova, Tihomira I', 'Stanley, Robert F', 'Ben-Neriah, Susana', 'Montagna, Cristina', 'Parekh, Samir', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Cripe, Larry', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Mitsiades, Constantine S', 'Verma, Amit', 'Steidl, Ulrich']","['Barreyro L', 'Will B', 'Bartholdy B', 'Zhou L', 'Todorova TI', 'Stanley RF', 'Ben-Neriah S', 'Montagna C', 'Parekh S', 'Pellagatti A', 'Boultwood J', 'Paietta E', 'Ketterling RP', 'Cripe L', 'Fernandez HF', 'Greenberg PL', 'Tallman MS', 'Steidl C', 'Mitsiades CS', 'Verma A', 'Steidl U']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA166429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737-05S3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA131503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3418722,2012/06/23 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46531-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-404699 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 9;120(6):1290-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-404699.

Overexpression of miR-125b in CLL-derived cell lines resulted in the repression of many transcripts encoding enzymes implicated in cell metabolism. Metabolomics analyses showed that miR-125b overexpression modulated glucose, glutathione, lipid, and glycerolipid metabolism. Changes on the same metabolic pathways also were observed in CLLs. We furthermore analyzed the expression of some of miR-125b-target transcripts that are potentially involved in the aforementioned metabolic pathways and defined a miR-125b-dependent CLL metabolism-related transcript signature. Thus, miR-125b acts as a master regulator for the adaptation of cell metabolism to a transformed state.

To this end, despite shared androgen-dependence and functional similarities to the prostate gland, seminal vesicle cancer is exceptionally rare. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genomic pathway analyses comparing patient-matched normal prostate and seminal vesicle epithelial cells to identify novel pathways for tumor initiation and progression. Derived gene expression profiles were grouped into cancer biomodules using a protein-protein network algorithm to analyze their relationship to known oncogenes. Each resultant biomodule was assayed for its prognostic ability against publically available prostate cancer patient gene array datasets. RESULTS: Analyses show that the embryonic developmental biomodule containing four homeobox gene family members (Meis1, Meis2, Pbx1, and HoxA9) detects a survival difference in a set of watchful-waiting patients (n = 172, P = 0.05), identify men who are more likely to recur biochemically postprostatectomy (n = 78, P = 0.02), correlate with Gleason score (r = 0.98, P = 0.02), and distinguish between normal prostate, primary tumor, and metastatic disease. In contrast to other cancer types, Meis1, Meis2, and Pbx1 expression is decreased in poor-prognosis tumors, implying that they function as tumor suppressor genes for prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical staining documents nuclear basal-epithelial and stromal Meis2 staining, with loss of Meis2 expression in prostate tumors. CONCLUSION: These data implicate deregulation of the Hox protein cofactors Meis1, Meis2, and Pbx1 as serving a critical function to suppress prostate cancer initiation and progression.","['Chen, James L', 'Li, Jianrong', 'Kiriluk, Kyle J', 'Rosen, Alex M', 'Paner, Gladell P', 'Antic, Tatjana', 'Lussier, Yves A', 'Vander Griend, Donald J']","['Chen JL', 'Li J', 'Kiriluk KJ', 'Rosen AM', 'Paner GP', 'Antic T', 'Lussier YA', 'Vander Griend DJ']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 LM008308/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA090386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024999/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC3479663,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-0373 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0373 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 15;18(16):4291-302. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0373.

Mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase gene, DNMT3A, frequently occur in adult acute myeloid leukemia patients with poor prognoses. Most of the mutations occur within the dimer or tetramer interface, including Arg-882. We have identified that the most prevalent mutation, R882H, and three additional mutants along the tetramer interface disrupt tetramerization. The processive methylation of multiple CpG sites is disrupted when tetramerization is eliminated.

As gene expression profiles (GEPs) reflect the biology of MM in individual patients, we built a prognostic signature based on GEPs. GEPs obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients included in the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 trial (n=290) were used as training data. Using this set, a prognostic signature of 92 genes (EMC-92-gene signature) was generated by supervised principal component analysis combined with simulated annealing. Performance of the EMC-92-gene signature was confirmed in independent validation sets of newly diagnosed (total therapy (TT)2, n=351; TT3, n=142; MRC-IX, n=247) and relapsed patients (APEX, n=264). In all the sets, patients defined as high-risk by the EMC-92-gene signature show a clearly reduced overall survival (OS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19-5.29) for the TT2 study, 5.23 (95% CI: 2.46-11.13) for the TT3 study, 2.38 (95% CI: 1.65-3.43) for the MRC-IX study and 3.01 (95% CI: 2.06-4.39) for the APEX study (P<0.0001 in all studies). In multivariate analyses this signature was proven to be independent of the currently used prognostic factors. The EMC-92-gene signature is better or comparable to previously published signatures.

In hydrolysates, allergenic epitopes within CM proteins are diminished by enzymatic treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the allergenic and immunogenic properties of whey proteins during hydrolysis. METHODS: During hydrolysis, samples were obtained at 0, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min. Degradation was checked by HPLC and SDS-PAGE. Allergenic potential was analyzed by IgE crosslinking capacity of human Fcepsilon receptor type 1-transduced rat basophilic leukemia cells sensitized with serum of CM-allergic patients. Whey-sensitized C3H/HeOuJ mice were ear challenged intracutaneously with the hydrolysates. Immunogenicity was tested using whey-specific human T-cell clones and T-cell lines at the level of proliferation and release of IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-gamma. RESULTS: After 15 min of hydrolysis, the majority of the proteins were degraded. Hydrolysis for 15 min resulted in 92% inhibition of mast cell degranulation and in 82% reduction of ear swelling in the mouse model. In contrast, T-cell-stimulatory capacity was less affected by hydrolysis: reduction of human T-cell proliferation was only 9%. This was further reduced to 57 and 74% after 30 and 45 min of hydrolysis, respectively. Cytokine production followed the pattern of T-cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Via differential analysis of allergenic versus immunogenic properties of the time kinetics of hydrolysis of whey proteins, we have demonstrated specific hydrolysis conditions with reduced IgE-crosslinking responses but retained T-cell activating properties. This approach might be useful in better defining CM hydrolysates.","['Knipping, Karen', 'van Esch, Betty C A M', 'van Ieperen-van Dijk, Adrie G', 'van Hoffen, Els', 'van Baalen, Ton', 'Knippels, Leon M J', 'van der Heide, Sicco', 'Dubois, Anthony E J', 'Garssen, Johan', 'Knol, Edward F']","['Knipping K', 'van Esch BC', 'van Ieperen-van Dijk AG', 'van Hoffen E', 'van Baalen T', 'Knippels LM', 'van der Heide S', 'Dubois AE', 'Garssen J', 'Knol EF']","['Danone Research Center for Specialized Nutrition, Wageningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,,2012/06/23 06:00,2012/12/25 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['000338007 [pii]', '10.1159/000338007 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2012;159(3):263-70. doi: 10.1159/000338007.

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of patients with neurologic presentations of EMT from January 1, 1981, until May 30, 2011. Clinical data abstracted included demographics, presentation, bone marrow involvement, history of hematologic malignancy, complete blood count at presentation, EMT location, imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, EMT was the initial presentation of underlying hematologic disorder in 12 (57%). Six patients (29%) presented with primary EMT (no bone marrow involvement at presentation). The most common location was the thoracic spine (n = 9), usually manifesting as an epidural mass with vertebral body involvement. The initial diagnosis was incorrect in most (n = 17 [81%]). Treatments included radiation (n = 17 [ 81%]), chemotherapy (n = 14 [67%]), and surgery (n = 6 [29%]). Fifteen patients (71%) died. Estimated Kaplan-Meier median survival from diagnosis for 20 patients with adequate follow-up was 8 months. Of the 6 patients with primary EMT (no known systemic leukemia at diagnosis), 5 died at a median of 24 months (range 8-36 months) and 1 is still alive at 1 year. Of the 6 patients whose leukemia was diagnosed upon presenting with EMT, 3 are still alive. CONCLUSIONS: EMT affecting the nervous system can present in patients without a known hematologic disorder and is often not recognized. Thoracic paraspinal masses are the most common presentation. The prognosis for patients with neurologic presentation of EMT is generally poor, but longer survival is possible in patients presenting with isolated EMT or leukemia first diagnosed at the time of EMT presentation.","['Graff-Radford, Jonathan', 'Fugate, Jennifer E', 'Wijdicks, Eelco F M', 'Lachance, Daniel H', 'Rabinstein, Alejandro A']","['Graff-Radford J', 'Fugate JE', 'Wijdicks EF', 'Lachance DH', 'Rabinstein AA']","['Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120620,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,,2012/06/23 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['WNL.0b013e31825dce3b [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0b013e31825dce3b [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2012 Jul 3;79(1):85-91. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31825dce3b.

Emerging evidence is establishing a connection between AML and aberrant alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, which may result from aberrant expression of splicing factors, the mediators of splicing reactions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measured mRNA expression of 7 splicing factors belonging to the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, SRSF1 (SF2/ASF), SRSF2 (SC35), SRSF3 (SRp20), SRSF4 (SRp75), SRSF5 (SRp40), SRSF6 (SRp55), and SRSF7 (9G8), and 1 non-SR factor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 26 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 26 healthy controls. In addition, the relationship between splicing factors and the mRNA splicing patterns of the caspase-8 gene (CASP8) was investigated. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, the expression of splicing factors was obviously aberrant in newly diagnosed AML patients. The expression of SRSF1, SRSF3 and SRSF4 mRNAs was significantly decreased. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between several splicing factors and caspase-8 pre-mRNA splicing in AML patients, but not in control subjects. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aberrant expression of splicing factors in AML may potentially connect with abnormal expression of oncogenes and be useful for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of AML.","['Liu, Jing', 'Huang, Bo', 'Xiao, Yun', 'Xiong, Huo-Mei', 'Li, Jing', 'Feng, Dan-Qin', 'Chen, Xi-Min', 'Zhang, Hai-Bin', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong']","['Liu J', 'Huang B', 'Xiao Y', 'Xiong HM', 'Li J', 'Feng DQ', 'Chen XM', 'Zhang HB', 'Wang XZ']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,2012/06/23 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000338941 [pii]', '10.1159/000338941 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2012;35(6):335-40. doi: 10.1159/000338941.

Herein, we describe the generation of a fusion protein (Tat transactivator protein (TAT)-N24) that contains the protein transduction domain and N24, and examined its effects on the proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells. TAT-N24 not only blocks cell proliferation but remarkably induces differentiation of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Systemically administered TAT-N24 also significantly decreases growth of leukemia cell tumors in animal models. Furthermore, overexpression of p55PIK in leukemia cells leads to increased proliferation; however, TAT-N24 blocks this effect and concomitantly induces differentiation. There is significant upregulation of p55PIK mRNA and protein expression in leukemia cells from patients. TAT-N24 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces differentiation of bone marrow cells derived from patients with several different types of leukemia. These results show that cell-permeable N24 peptide induces leukemia cell differentiation and suggest that p55PIK may be a novel drug target for the treatment of hematopoetic malignancies.","['Wang, G', 'Deng, Y', 'Cao, X', 'Lai, S', 'Tong, Y', 'Luo, X', 'Feng, Y', 'Xia, X', 'Gong, J', 'Hu, J']","['Wang G', 'Deng Y', 'Cao X', 'Lai S', 'Tong Y', 'Luo X', 'Feng Y', 'Xia X', 'Gong J', 'Hu J']","['Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120622,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC3469064,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201270 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Nov;19(11):1870-9. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.70.

We sought to evaluate the outcome of second allogeneic HSCT for children with relapsed leukemia with focus on factors that potentially improve outcome. Thirty-eight children were identified. The median time between transplants was 18.6 months (range 6.7-50.1 months). With median follow-up of 44 months the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 59.1 +/- 8.2%. The leukemia-free survival was 51.8 +/- 8.2% and the non-relapse mortality 30.8 +/- 7.9%. Eleven patients (30%) died of non-relapse mortality at a median of 37 days (range 16-260 days) from second HSCT. Twenty-one patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after second HSCT. Patients who developed aGVHD had lower risk for mortality compared to patients who did not have aGVHD, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.095-0.788, p-value 0.0163). Similarly, patients who developed aGVHD following second HSCT had lower risk for relapse (HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.051-0.857, p-value 0.0297). Patients who developed aGVHD after first HSCT were less likely to benefit from second HSCT compared to patients without aGVHD after first HSCT. Our experience suggests that second HSCT for pediatric relapsed leukemia can result in acceptable survival and aGVHD is associated with improved outcome.","['Schechter, Tal', 'Avila, Laura', 'Frangoul, Haydar', 'Domm, Jennifer', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Naithani, Rahul', 'Zhao, Xiuyan', 'Pollock-Barziv, Stacey', 'Roifman, Chaim', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Doyle, John']","['Schechter T', 'Avila L', 'Frangoul H', 'Domm J', 'Dupuis LL', 'Naithani R', 'Zhao X', 'Pollock-Barziv S', 'Roifman C', 'Gassas A', 'Doyle J']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. tal.schechter-finkelstein@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120905,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.704998 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jan;54(1):105-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.704998.

Different studies have reported conflicting results, stating the importance of the length, position and number of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) for prognostic significance. In the present study, FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 51 (23%) of 218 patients with AML. Using sequence analysis we categorized ITD integration sites according to functional regions of the FLT3 receptor. Median ITD size was 61 bp. The insertion site was strongly correlated with ITD size: more C-terminal located inserted fragments were significantly bigger. Our data confirm that FLT3-ITD mutations identify a subset of young patients with AML with normal cytogenetics but with inferior outcome. Patients with AML with mutation localization outside the juxtamembrane domain showed no correlation with worse prognosis. A high mutant/wild-type ratio appears to have a major impact on the prognostic relevance.","['Blau, Olga', 'Berenstein, Rimma', 'Sindram, Annette', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang']","['Blau O', 'Berenstein R', 'Sindram A', 'Blau IW']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University School of Medicine, Berlin, Germany. olga.blau@charite.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120905,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.704999 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jan;54(1):145-52. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.704999.

We developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify heme interacting (HI) compounds, which included imidazole, pyridine, carbonitrile, isocyanide, and quinoline core structures that are known to interact with heme or hemin. The cytotoxicity of several of the compounds towards human leukemia cell lines could be modulated by increasing or decreasing heme synthesis. Spectral analysis indicated that distinct molecular interactions occurred with heme, suggesting that HI compounds appear to target heme with exquisite specificity.

The pterocarpanquinone LQB-118 is a new compound that induces apoptosis in leukemia cells. The objective of this work was to analyze the role of LQB-118 in inhibiting the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), XIAP and survivin, as well as in modulating the subcellular localization of NFkappaB, in comparison with idarubicin. LQB- 118 was more effective in inducing apoptosis than idarubicin in both AML Kasumi-1 cell line and cells from patients despite their MDR phenotype. LQB-118-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a marked inhibition of IAPs, and cytoplasmatic NFkappaB subcellular localization. On the other hand, idarubicin increased the IAPs expression and translocated NFkappaB to the nucleus. The inhibition profile of survivin induced by LQB-118 was comparable to the survivin inhibition profile when we investigated the efficiency of survivin-small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment. LQB-118 as well as survivin-siRNA contributed similarly to the increase in apoptosis rate of Kasumi-1 cells. The data indicated that there is a functional interaction between the survivin, XIAP and NFkappaB, which appears to be involved in idarubicin resistance of Kasumi-1 cells. The efficacy of LQB-118 to induce cell death through inhibiting survivin suggests that this IAP may be involved in the chemoresistance phenotype in AML cells. Our findings suggest that LQB-118 might be a promising therapeutic approach for AML patients through survivin downregulation.","['de Souza Reis, Flaviana R', 'de Faria, Fernanda C Casal', 'Castro, Carolina P', 'de Souza, Paloma S', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos, Flavia', 'Bello, Reinaldo D', 'da Silva, Alcides J', 'Costa, Paulo R R', 'Maia, Raquel C']","['de Souza Reis FR', 'de Faria FC', 'Castro CP', 'de Souza PS', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos F', 'Bello RD', 'da Silva AJ', 'Costa PR', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer INCA, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['CMCACA-EPUB-20120618-2 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520611313020019 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2013 Feb;13(2):341-51. doi: 10.2174/1871520611313020019.,20130805,,,,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (LQB 118)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Pterocarpans)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Pterocarpans/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PHA-739358, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, was reported to inhibit the Bcr/Abl T315I mutant in CML cells but no preclinical studies have examined this in detail in human ALL. RESULTS: We compared the sensitivity of human Bcr/Abl T315I, Bcr/Abl wild type and non-Bcr/Abl ALL cells to this drug. PHA-739358 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis independently of Bcr/Abl, the T315I mutation, or presence of the tumor suppressor p53, but the degree of effectiveness varied between different ALL samples. Since short-term treatment with a single dose of drug only transiently inhibited proliferation, we tested combination treatments of PHA-739358 with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor Lonafarnib, with vincristine and with dasatinib. All combinations reduced viability and cell numbers compared to treatment with a single drug. Clonogenic assays showed that 25 nM PHA-739358 significantly reduced the colony growth potential of Ph-positive ALL cells, and combined treatment with a second drug abrogated colony growth in this assay. PHA-739358 further effectively blocked Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity and Aurora kinase B in vivo, and mice transplanted with human Bcr/Abl T315I ALL cells treated with a 3x 7-day cycle of PHA-739358 as mono-treatment had significantly longer survival. CONCLUSIONS: PHA-739358 represents an alternative drug for the treatment of both Ph-positive and negative ALL, although combined treatment with a second drug may be needed to eradicate the leukemic cells.","['Fei, Fei', 'Lim, Min', 'Schmidhuber, Sabine', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Fei F', 'Lim M', 'Schmidhuber S', 'Moll J', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","[""Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology and The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],['CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,PMC3489684,2012/06/23 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-42 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Jun 21;11:42. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-42.,20130322,10.1186/1476-4598-11-42 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'M3X659D0FY (danusertib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a cell culture system using monocytes (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1), we studied the effects of BMP7 on monocytes polarizing into M2 macrophages. The data demonstrate that THP-1 cells contain a BMP type II receptor (BMPR2), and that its activation is significantly (p < 0.05) increased following treatment with BMP7. Furthermore, there was an increase of M2 macrophages, BMPR2, and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1ra compared with the respective controls.

The PHF6 gene encodes a protein with two plant homeodomain (PHD)-like zinc finger domains. As many PHD-like domains function to target chromatin remodelers to post-translationally modified histones, this suggests a role for PHF6 in chromatin regulation. However, PHD domains are usually found in association with a catalytic domain, a feature that is lacking in PHF6. This distinct domain structure and the minimal information on its cellular function prompted us to perform a proteomic screen to identify PHF6 binding partners. We expressed recombinant Flag-tagged PHF6 in HEK 293T cells for coimmunoprecipitation, and analyzed the purified products by mass spectrometry. We identified proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, and chromatin regulation, consistent with PHF6 localization to both the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Notably, PHF6 copurified with multiple constituents of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, including CHD4, HDAC1, and RBBP4. We demonstrate that this PHF6-NuRD complex is not present in the nucleolus but is restricted to the nucleoplasm. The association with NuRD represents the first known interaction for PHF6 and implicates it in chromatin regulation.","['Todd, Matthew A M', 'Picketts, David J']","['Todd MA', 'Picketts DJ']","['Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8L6.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120703,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,,2012/06/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/23 06:00'],"['2012/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr3004369 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2012 Aug 3;11(8):4326-37. doi: 10.1021/pr3004369.

Infected cells do not express the growth-promoting set of EBV-encoded genes and therefore they do not yield LCLs, in most experiments. With exceptional clones, lines were obtained however. We describe a new line, HG3, established by in vitro EBV-infection from an IGHV1-2 unmutated CLL patient clone. All cells expressed EBNA-2 and LMP-1, the EBV-encoded genes pivotal for transformation. The karyotype, FISH cytogenetics and SNP-array profile of the line and the patient's ex vivo clone showed biallelic 13q14 deletions with genomic loss of DLEU7, miR15a/miR16-1, the two micro-RNAs that are deleted in 50% of CLL cases. Further features of CLL cells were: expression of CD5/CD20/CD27/CD43 and release of IgM natural antibodies reacting with oxLDL-like epitopes on apoptotic cells (cf. stereotyped subset-1). Comparison with two LCLs established from normal B cells showed 32 genes expressed at higher levels (> 2-fold). Among these were LHX2 and LILRA. These genes may play a role in the development of the disease. LHX2 expression was shown in self-renewing multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, and LILRA4 codes for a receptor for bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 that contributes to B cell development. Twenty-four genes were expressed at lower levels, among these PARD3 that is essential for asymmetric cell division. These genes may contribute to establish precursors of CLL clones by regulation of cellular phenotype in the hematopoietic compartment.

HTLV-1 is endemic in parts of Africa and the highest prevalence in West Africa (5%) has been reported in Caio, a rural area in the North-West of Guinea-Bissau. It is not known which HTLV-1 variants are present in this community. Sequence data can provide insights in the molecular epidemiology and help to understand the origin and spread of HTLV-1. OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the molecular diversity of HTLV-1 in West Africa. METHODS: HTLV-1 infected individuals were identified in community surveys between 1990-2007. The complete Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) and p24 coding region of HTLV-1 was sequenced from infected subjects. Socio-demographic data were obtained from community census and from interviews performed by fieldworkers. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between the Caio HTLV-1 and HTLV-1 from other parts of the world. RESULTS: LTR and p24 sequences were obtained from 72 individuals (36 LTR, 24 p24 only and 12 both). Consistent with the low evolutionary change of HTLV-1, many of the sequences from unrelated individuals showed 100% nucleotide identity. Most (45 of 46) of the LTR sequences clustered with the Cosmopolitan HTLV-1 subtype 1a, subgroup D (1aD). LTR and p24 sequences from two subjects were divergent and formed a significant cluster with HTLV-1 subtype 1g, and with the most divergent African Simian T-cell Lymphotropic Virus, Tan90. CONCLUSIONS: The Cosmopolitan HTLV-1 1aD predominates in this rural West African community. However, HTLV-1 subtype 1g is also present. This subtype has not been described before in West Africa and may be more widespread than previously thought. These data are in line with the hypothesis that multiple monkey-to-man zoonotic events are contributing to HTLV-1 diversity.","['van Tienen, Carla', 'de Silva, Thushan I', 'Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior', 'Onyango, Clayton O', 'Jarju, Sheikh', 'Goncalves, Nato', 'Vincent, Tim', 'Aaby, Peter', 'Whittle, Hilton', 'Schim van der Loeff, Maarten', 'Cotten, Matthew']","['van Tienen C', 'de Silva TI', 'Alcantara LC', 'Onyango CO', 'Jarju S', 'Goncalves N', 'Vincent T', 'Aaby P', 'Whittle H', 'Schim van der Loeff M', 'Cotten M']","['Virology, Medical Research Council, Fajara, The Gambia. c.vantienen@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],['MC_U190081997/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20120612,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,PMC3373628,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0001690 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-11-00871 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2012;6(6):e1690. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001690.

ZAP binds to specific viral mRNAs and recruits cellular mRNA degradation machinery to degrade the target RNA. The common features of ZAP-responsive RNA sequences remain elusive and thus whether a virus is susceptible to ZAP can only be determined experimentally. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a recently identified gamma-retrovirus that was originally thought to be involved in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome but recently proved to be a laboratory artefact. Nonetheless, XMRV as a new retrovirus has been extensively studied. Since XMRV and MoMLV share only 67.9% sequence identity in the 3'UTRs, which is the target sequence of ZAP in MoMLV, whether XMRV is susceptible to ZAP remains to be determined. FINDINGS: We constructed an XMRV-luc vector, in which the coding sequences of Gag-Pol and part of Env were replaced with luciferase-coding sequence. Overexpression of ZAP potently inhibited the expression of XMRV-luc in a ZAP expression-level-dependent manner, while downregulation of endogenous ZAP rendered cells more sensitive to infection. Furthermore, ZAP inhibited the spreading of replication-competent XMRV. Consistent with the previously reported mechanisms by which ZAP inhibits viral infection, ZAP significantly inhibited the accumulation of XMRV-luc mRNA in the cytoplasm. The ZAP-responsive element in XMRV mRNA was mapped to the 3'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: ZAP inhibits XMRV replication by preventing the accumulation of viral mRNA in the cytoplasm. Documentation of ZAP inhibiting XMRV helps to broaden the spectrum of ZAP's antiviral activity. Comparison of the target sequences of ZAP in XMRV and MoMLV helps to better understand the features of ZAP-responsive elements.","['Wang, Xinlu', 'Tu, Fan', 'Zhu, Yiping', 'Gao, Guangxia']","['Wang X', 'Tu F', 'Zhu Y', 'Gao G']","['Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3376128,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0039159 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10132 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e39159. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0039159.

Although the former are more undifferentiated than the latter, they require signal transduction inhibitors and sustained expression of the transgenes used for iPSC production. We used a transcriptionally enhanced version of OCT4 to establish LIF-dependent human iPSCs without the use of inhibitors and sustained transgene expression. These cells belong to the primed type of pluripotent stem cell, similar to bFGF-dependent iPSCs. Thus, the particular cytokine required for iPSC production does not necessarily define stem cell phenotypes as previously thought. It is likely that the bFGF and LIF signaling pathways converge on unidentified OCT4 target genes. These findings suggest that our LIF-dependent human iPSCs could provide a novel model to investigate the role of cytokine signaling in cellular reprogramming.","['Hirai, Hiroyuki', 'Firpo, Meri', 'Kikyo, Nobuaki']","['Hirai H', 'Firpo M', 'Kikyo N']","['Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK082430/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK082430/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3374774,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0039022 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10215 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e39022. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0039022.

Furthermore, we correlated transcripts with the clinical course of the disease before and after treatment. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed from RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T cell responses against RHAMM were assessed by tetramer staining (flow cytometry) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. Results were correlated with the clinical outcome of patients. The results of the present study showed that almost 60% of the patients were RHAMM positive; specific T-cells recognizing RHAMM could be detected, but they were nonfunctional in terms of interferon gamma or granzyme B release as demonstrated by ELISPOT assays.

However, the side effects and relatively low efficacy of As2O3 in treating other leukemias have limited its wider use in therapeutic applications. In the present study, we found that the expression of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) affects the resistance to As2O3 in leukemias, including APL; As2O3 upregulated CBR1 expression at the transcriptional level by stimulating the activity of the transcription factor activator protein-1. Moreover, CBR1 overexpression was sufficient to protect cells against As2O3 through modulation of the generation of reactive oxygen species, whereas the attenuation of CBR1 was sufficient to sensitize cells to As2O3. A combination treatment with the specific CBR1 inhibitor hydroxy-PP-Me remarkably increased As2O3-induced apoptotic cell death compared with As2O3 alone, both in vitro and in vivo. These results were confirmed in primary cultured human acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, with no significant cell death observed in normal leukocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate that CBR1 contributes to the low efficacy of As2O3 and, therefore, is a rational target for the development of combination chemotherapy with As2O3 in diverse leukemias including APL.","['Jang, Miran', 'Kim, Yeonghwan', 'Won, Hyeran', 'Lim, Sangbin', 'K R, Jyothi', 'Dashdorj, Amarjargal', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Kim, Si-Young', 'Shokat, Kevan M', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Kim, Sung Soo']","['Jang M', 'Kim Y', 'Won H', 'Lim S', 'K R J', 'Dashdorj A', 'Min YH', 'Kim SY', 'Shokat KM', 'Ha J', 'Kim SS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BK21 project), Medical Research Center for Bioreaction to Reactive Oxygen Species and Biomedical Science Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-1110 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1110 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 15;72(16):4214-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1110.

This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). Here we report the effects of a host protein, large ribosomal protein 4 (RPL4), on the efficiency of recoding. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, we found that transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding RPL4 cDNA increases recoding efficiency in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal enhancement of nearly twofold. Expression of RPL4 increases recoding of reporters containing retroviral readthrough and frameshift sequences, as well as the Sindbis virus leaky termination signal. RPL4-induced enhancement of recoding is cell line specific and appears to be specific to RPL4 among ribosomal proteins.

METHOD: A population-based case-control study of childhood ALL was conducted in Australia. Information about the occupational pesticide exposure of mothers and fathers was collected using job-specific modules. Information on the types and extent of pesticide exposure was collected for mothers and fathers before and around the time of conception, and also for mothers during pregnancy for the index case or control and for 1 year after birth. RESULTS: Paternal occupational exposure to pesticides before or around conception was not related to increased risk of childhood ALL. There was a low prevalence of occupational exposure to pesticides among women that reduced after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Paternal occupational exposure to pesticides was not found to be associated with an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the offspring. The study was underpowered with respect to maternal exposure to pesticides.","['Glass, Deborah C', 'Reid, Alison', 'Bailey, Helen D', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Fritschi, Lin']","['Glass DC', 'Reid A', 'Bailey HD', 'Milne E', 'Fritschi L']","['Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology, Monash University, The Alfred Centre, Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia. deborah.glass@monash.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2011-100250 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2011-100250 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2012 Nov;69(11):846-9. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2011-100250.

For most drug combinations, underlying signaling mechanisms responsible for positive drug-drug interactions remain elusive. Here, we prove a decisive role for the Bcl-2 family member NOXA to mediate cell death by certain drug combinations, even if drugs were combined which acted independently from NOXA, when given alone. In proof-of-principle studies, betulinic acid, doxorubicin and vincristine induced cell death in a p53- and NOXA-independent pathway involving mitochondrial pore formation, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. In contrast, when betulinic acid was combined with either doxorubicine or vincristine, cell death signaling changed considerably; the drug combinations clearly depended on both p53 and NOXA. Similarly and of high clinical relevance, in patient-derived childhood acute leukemia samples the drug combinations, but not the single drugs depended on p53 and NOXA, as shown by RNA interference studies in patient-derived cells. Our data emphasize that NOXA represents an important target molecule for combinations of drugs that alone do not target NOXA. NOXA might have a special role in regulating apoptosis sensitivity in the complex interplay of polychemotherapy. Deciphering the differences in signaling of single drugs and drug combinations might enable designing highly effective novel polychemotherapy regimens.","['Ehrhardt, H', 'Hofig, I', 'Wachter, F', 'Obexer, P', 'Fulda, S', 'Terziyska, N', 'Jeremias, I']","['Ehrhardt H', 'Hofig I', 'Wachter F', 'Obexer P', 'Fulda S', 'Terziyska N', 'Jeremias I']","['Helmholtz Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC3388227,2012/06/22 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201253 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.53 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Jun 21;3:e327. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.53.,20130723,10.1038/cddis.2012.53 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The translocation generates a chimeric oncogene, which, depending on the precise location of the fusion causes chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML (p210(bcr-abl)) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL (p190(bcr-abl)). The difference between p190(bcr-abl) and p210(bcr-abl) resides in the unique presence of the DH/PH domain in p210(bcr-abl). Ba/F3 cells are not motile but acquire spontaneous motility upon ectopic expression of either p190(bcr-abl) or p210(bcr-abl). Whereas p210(bcr-abl)-expressing cells present typical amoeboid motility, p190(bcr-abl)-expressing cells motility appears dependent on rolling movements. Both motility types are triggered by Vav1 in complex with Bcr-Abl, and dependent on Rac1 activity. Interestingly, the RhoA specific p210(bcr-abl) DH/PH domain regulates the motility mode by shifting motility from a rolling type toward an amoeboid one. In this study, we show that Ba/F3p190(bcr-abl)-expressing cells assemble invadopodia-like structures visualized as dense F-actin dots containing the actin polymerization machinery and bestowed with matrix degradation activities. The formation of these structures is driven by the reduction of RhoA activity associated with the loss of the DH/PH domain in p190(bcr-abl) and correlates with an increase in Cdc42 activity. Such phenotype could also be obtained by impairing p210(bcr-abl) RhoA GEF function. Thus, invadopodia formation in association with rolling-type motility characterizes p190(bcr-abl) leukemic cells. The description of invadopodia in cells harboring the p190(bcr-abl) oncoprotein presents a novel feature of these highly invasive leukemic cells and provides a novel therapeutic drug target to treat the disease.","['Daubon, Thomas', 'Rochelle, Tristan', 'Bourmeyster, Nicolas', 'Genot, Elisabeth']","['Daubon T', 'Rochelle T', 'Bourmeyster N', 'Genot E']","['Universite de Bordeaux, Physiopathologie du cancer du foie, INSERM U, France. t.daubon@iecb.u-bordeaux.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,,2012/06/22 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-9335(12)00082-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2012 Nov-Dec;91(11-12):978-87. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.04.006.

The present study was performed to determine the function of miR-29b (microRNA-29b) in trophoblast cells and its underlying role in the pathogenesis of PE. The prediction of miR-29b target genes was performed using computer-based programs, including Targetscan, Pictar and miRBase. The function of these target genes was analysed further by gene ontology (GO). The effects of miR-29b on apoptosis, and invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo and JAR) were examined by flow cytometry and Matrigel assay respectively. We found that miR-29b induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells. Further studies confirmed that miR-29b regulated the expression of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), MMP2 (encoding matrix metallproteinase 2), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and ITGB1 (integrin beta1) genes by directly binding to their 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions). Moreover, we identified that there was an inverse correlation between miR-29b and its target genes in subjects with PE. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for miR-29b in invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells, and miR-29b may become a new potential therapeutic target for PE.","['Li, Pengfei', 'Guo, Wei', 'Du, Leilei', 'Zhao, Junli', 'Wang, Yaping', 'Liu, Liu', 'Hu, Yali', 'Hou, Yayi']","['Li P', 'Guo W', 'Du L', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Y', 'Liu L', 'Hu Y', 'Hou Y']","['Immunology and Reproductive Biology Lab, Medical School & State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20120121 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20120121 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2013 Jan;124(1):27-40. doi: 10.1042/CS20120121.,20121121,10.1042/CS20120121 [doi],,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (ITGB1BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Laminin', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteoglycans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trophoblasts/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE (2) ) synthesis has been reported in AK and SCC, and the COX inhibitor diclofenac in hyaluronic acid (diclofenac/HA) was approved for AK therapy. Its mode of action, however, remained to be unravelled. In the present study, diclofenac resulted in reduced PGE (2) levels in apoptosis-sensitive cutaneous SCC cell lines (SCL-II, SCC-12, SCC-13) whereas no PGE (2) and no COX-2 expression was detectable in a SCC cell line resistant to apoptosis induction (SCL-I). Activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways was evident in SCC cells owing to loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of the mitochondrial factors cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Characteristic proapoptotic changes at the level of Bcl-2 proteins occurred in sensitive cells, as upregulation of Bad and downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-w. In contrast, Bad was already high, and Mcl-1 and Bcl-w were already low in resistant SCL-I, even without treatment, which may be explained by the lack of PGE (2) . An antiapoptotic downregulation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Noxa and Puma was, however, also seen in SCL-I, suggesting here pathways independent of COX-2. The regulations of Mcl-1 and Bad were also reproduced in SCC cells by the more selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, thus further underlining the specific role of COX-2. The findings illuminate the mode of action of diclofenac/HA in SCC cells as well as principles of their resistance, which may allow further adaptation and improvement of the new therapy.","['Rodust, Paul M', 'Fecker, Lothar F', 'Stockfleth, Eggert', 'Eberle, Jurgen']","['Rodust PM', 'Fecker LF', 'Stockfleth E', 'Eberle J']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Skin Cancer Center, University Medical Center Charite, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,,2012/06/22 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0625.2012.01516.x [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2012 Jul;21(7):520-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2012.01516.x.,20121218,10.1111/j.1600-0625.2012.01516.x [doi],,,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Diclofenac/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous research has established that the neuroinflammatory response plays a significant role in cord damage post-SCI. However, global immunosuppressive therapies have demonstrated mixed results. As a result, more specific therapies modulating inflammation after injury are needed. In this regard, research into cytokine signaling has demonstrated that cytokines of the gp130 family including IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) play key roles in mediating damage to the spinal cord. Since members of the gp130 family all share a common signal transduction pathway via the JAK/STAT system, we performed the first study of a relatively new member of the gp130 family, IL-11, in SCI. METHODS: A validated clip-compression mouse model of SCI was used to assess for temporal changes in expression of IL-11 and its receptor, IL-11Ralpha, post-SCI. To elucidate the role of IL-II in the pathophysiology of SCI, we compared differences in locomotor recovery (Basso Mouse Score; CatWalk), electrophysiological spinal cord signaling, histopathology, and the acute inflammatory neutrophil response in IL-11Ralpha knockouts with littermate wild-type C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: We found an increase in gene expression of IL-11 in the spinal cord to a peak at twenty-four hours post-SCI with increases in IL-11Ralpha gene expression, peaking at seven days post-SCI. In spite of clear changes in the temporal expression of both IL-11 and its receptor, we found that there were no significant differences in motor function, electrophysiological signaling, histopathology, or neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord between wild-type and knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to address IL-11 in SCI. This study provides evidence that IL-11 signaling may not play as significant a role in SCI as other gp130 cytokines, which will ideally guide future therapy design and the signaling pathways those therapies target.","['Cho, Newton', 'Nguyen, Dung H', 'Satkunendrarajah, Kajana', 'Branch, Donald R', 'Fehlings, Michael G']","['Cho N', 'Nguyen DH', 'Satkunendrarajah K', 'Branch DR', 'Fehlings MG']","['Department of Genetics and Development, Toronto Western Research Institute and Spinal Program, Krembil Neuroscience Center, University Health Network, 399 Bathurst Street, Toronto, ON, M5T 2S8, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120620,England,J Neuroinflammation,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,PMC3410772,2012/06/22 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/06/22 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-2094-9-134 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-2094-9-134 [doi]']",epublish,J Neuroinflammation. 2012 Jun 20;9:134. doi: 10.1186/1742-2094-9-134.,20130610,10.1186/1742-2094-9-134 [doi],,,"['0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Interleukin-11/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Skills/physiology', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks a common genetic aberration amenable to therapeutic targeting. However, our understanding of normal B-cell versus CLL biology points to differences in properties of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling that may be amenable to selective therapeutic targeting. The application of mouse models has further expanded this understanding and provides information about targets in the BCR signaling pathway that may have other important functions in cell development or long-term health. In addition, overexpression or knockout of selected targets offers the potential to validate targets genetically using new mouse models of CLL. The initial success of BCR-targeted therapies has promoted much excitement in the field of CLL. At the present time, GS-1101, which reversibly inhibits PI3Kdelta, and ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, have generated the most promising early results in clinical trials including predominately refractory CLL where durable disease control has been observed. This review provides a summary of BCR signaling, tools for studying this pathway relevant to drug development in CLL, and early progress made with therapeutics targeting BCR-related kinases.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C']","['Woyach JA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120619,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3418714,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46518-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-362624 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 9;120(6):1175-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-362624.

Here we report the use of all 3 agents in combination in an APML4 phase 2 protocol. For induction, ATO was superimposed on an ATRA and idarubicin backbone, with scheduling designed to exploit antileukemic synergy while minimizing cardiotoxicity and the severity of differentiation syndrome. Consolidation comprised 2 cycles of ATRA and ATO without chemotherapy, followed by 2 years of maintenance with ATRA, oral methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. Of 124 evaluable patients, there were 4 (3.2%) early deaths, 118 (95%) hematologic complete remissions, and all 112 patients who commenced consolidation attained molecular complete remission. The 2-year rate for freedom from relapse is 97.5%, failure-free survival 88.1%, and overall survival 93.2%. These outcomes were not influenced by FLT3 mutation status, whereas failure-free survival was correlated with Sanz risk stratification (P[trend] = .03). Compared with our previously reported ATRA/idarubicin-based protocol (APML3), APML4 patients had statistically significantly improved freedom from relapse (P = .006) and failure-free survival (P = .01).

Here, we show that FAK splice variants are abnormally expressed in the primitive leukemic cells of poor prognosis AML patients. In the CD34(+) 38(-) 123(+) long-term culture-initiating cell-enriched leukemic cells of these patients, FAK upregulates expression of Frizzled-4 and phosphorylates Pyk2 to enable the required association of Pyk2 with the Wnt5a/Frizzled-4/LRP5 endocytosis complex and downstream activation of beta-catenin, thereby replacing the Wnt3a-controlled canonical pathway used by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Transduction of primitive normal human hematopoietic cells with FAK splice variants induces a marked increase in their clonogenic activity and signaling via the Wnt5a-controlled canonical pathway. Targeting FAK or beta-catenin efficiently eradicates primitive leukemic cells in vitro suggesting that FAK could be a useful therapeutic target for improved treatment of poor prognosis AML cases.","['Despeaux, Mathieu', 'Chicanne, Gaetan', 'Rouer, Evelyne', 'De Toni-Costes, Fabienne', 'Bertrand, Jessica', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Vergnolle, Nathalie', 'Eaves, Connie', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Girault, Jean-Antoine', 'Racaud-Sultan, Claire']","['Despeaux M', 'Chicanne G', 'Rouer E', 'De Toni-Costes F', 'Bertrand J', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Vergnolle N', 'Eaves C', 'Payrastre B', 'Girault JA', 'Racaud-Sultan C']","['Inserm U1043, CNRS U5282, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,2012/06/21 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1157 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Aug;30(8):1597-610. doi: 10.1002/stem.1157.,20130228,10.1002/stem.1157 [doi],,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (LRP6 protein, human)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Frizzled Receptors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein', 'beta Catenin/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To produce a potentially therapeutic LIFRalpha-CT3 with cell-permeable activity, we constructed a eukaryotic expression pcDNA3.0-TAT-CT3-cMyc plasmid with a signal peptide (ss) inserted into the N-terminal that codes for an ss-TAT-CT3-cMyc fusion protein. The stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells via this vector and subsequent selection by Geneticin resulted in cell lines that express and secrete TAT-CT3-cMyc. The spent medium of pcDNA3.0-TAT-CT3-cMyc-transfected CHO cells could be purified using a cMyc-epitope-tag agarose affinity chromatography column and could be detected via SDS-PAGE, with antibodies against cMyc-tag. The direct administration of TAT-CT3-cMyc to HL-60 cell culture media caused the enrichment of CT3-cMyc in the cytoplasm and nucleus within 30 min and led to a significant reduction of viable cells (P < 0.05) 8 h after exposure. The advantages of using this mammalian expression system include the ease of generating TAT fusion proteins that are adequately transcripted and the potential for a sustained production of such proteins in vitro for future AML therapy.","['Sun, Q', 'Xiong, J', 'Lu, J', 'Xu, S', 'Li, Y', 'Zhong, X P', 'Gao, G K', 'Liu, H Q']","['Sun Q', 'Xiong J', 'Lu J', 'Xu S', 'Li Y', 'Zhong XP', 'Gao GK', 'Liu HQ']","['Department of Hyperbaric Medicine, No 401 Hospital of PLA, Qingdao, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120621,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,PMC3854185,2012/06/21 06:00,2014/07/14 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2012007500101 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500101 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2012 Oct;45(10):913-20. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2012007500101.

Despite clinical significance of GC and considerable efforts to understand it, the molecular basis of GC regulated cell death and the resistance phenomenon remains, however, poorly understood. Using Affymetrix-based whole genome expression profiling our group has previously identified a number of prominent glucocorticoid-response genes (Blood 107: 2061, 2006). Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) was one of the best candidate genes. This study was proposed to investigate the possible role of PLZF in GC regulated cell death in leukemic model cell line NALM6. To this end, we generated NALM6 cell line (bulk) transduced with a retroviral expression vectors, pHR-SFFV-PLZF-IRES-Puro (U426) and pHR-SFFV-Venus-IRES-Puro (U417), as control, for constitutive gene-expression. HEK293T cells were transfected transiently to generate viral particles. These cell lines were characterized by Western blotting and used to assay the effect of constitutive PLZF expression. In conclusion, we report that bona fide transcription repressor PLZF, which turned out as prominent GC-regulated gene both in vivo and in vitro situations was found to enhance the GC-induced cell death (basal) in leukemic model cell line NALM6 after 48 and 72h time points.","['Wasim, Muhamamd', 'Mansha, Muhammad', 'Kofler, Anita', 'Awan, Ali Raza', 'Babar, Masroor Ellahi', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Wasim M', 'Mansha M', 'Kofler A', 'Awan AR', 'Babar ME', 'Kofler R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. muhammad.wasim@uvas.edu.pk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,Pak J Pharm Sci,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,9426356,,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pak J Pharm Sci. 2012 Jul;25(3):617-21.,20120731,,,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a histone acetyltransferase, MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein) is important for HOX gene expression as well as embryo and postnatal development. In vivo, MOZ forms a tetrameric complex with other subunits, including several chromatin-binding modules with regulatory functions. Here we report the solution structure of the tandem PHD (plant homeodomain) finger (PHD12) of human MOZ in a free state and the 1.47 A crystal structure in complex with H3K14ac peptide, which reveals the structural basis for the recognition of unmodified R2 and acetylated K14 on histone H3. Moreover, the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RT-PCR assays indicate that PHD12 facilitates the localization of MOZ onto the promoter locus of the HOXA9 gene, thereby promoting the H3 acetylation around the promoter region and further up-regulating the HOXA9 mRNA level. Taken together, our findings suggest that the combinatorial readout of the H3R2/K14ac by PHD12 might represent an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism that governs transcription and also provide a clue of cross-talk between the MOZ complex and histone H3 modifications.","['Qiu, Yu', 'Liu, Lei', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Han, Chuanchun', 'Li, Fudong', 'Zhang, Jiahai', 'Wang, Yan', 'Li, Guohong', 'Mei, Yide', 'Wu, Mian', 'Wu, Jihui', 'Shi, Yunyu']","['Qiu Y', 'Liu L', 'Zhao C', 'Han C', 'Li F', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Y', 'Li G', 'Mei Y', 'Wu M', 'Wu J', 'Shi Y']","['Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,PMC3387664,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['26/12/1376 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.188359.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2012 Jun 15;26(12):1376-91. doi: 10.1101/gad.188359.112.,20120830,10.1101/gad.188359.112 [doi],,,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying JMJD3-mediated transcriptional regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that JMJD3 is associated with KIAA1718, whose substrates include dimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me2), and proteins involved in transcriptional elongation. JMJD3 and KIAA1718 directly bind to and regulate the expression of a plethora of common target genes in both a demethylase activity-dependent and -independent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. We found that JMJD3 and KIAA1718 collaborate to demethylate trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) on a subset of their target genes, some of which are bivalently marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and associated with promoter-proximal, paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) before activation. Reduction of either JMJD3 or KIAA1718 diminishes Pol II traveling along the gene bodies of the affected genes while having no effect on the promoter-proximal Pol II. Furthermore, JMJD3 and KIAA1718 also play a role in localizing elongation factors SPT6 and SPT16 to the target genes. Our results support the model whereby JMJD3 activates bivalent gene transcription by demethylating H3K27me3 and promoting transcriptional elongation.

Though MLLs are well recognised as crucial players in histone methylation and gene regulation; little is known about the biochemical functions of MLL4 and its roles in cancer. METHODS: Herein, we have investigated the roles of MLL4 in cell viability, cell-cycle progression and explored its potential roles in tumour growth using antisense-mediated knockdown experiments, flow-cytometry analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence staining and animal models. RESULTS: Our studies demonstrated that knockdown of MLL4 severely affects cell-cycle progression and induces apoptotic cell death in cultured tumour cells. Knockdown of MLL4 induced nuclear condensation, fragmentation, cytochrome-c release from mitochondria to cytosol and activated caspase-3/7 indicating apoptotic cell death. The MLL4 regulates expression of various critical cell-cycle regulatory genes such as cyclin D, cyclin E, p27, HOXA5 and HOXB7 via histone H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Interestingly, application of MLL4 antisense suppressed tumour growth in vivo in colon cancer xenograft implanted in nude mouse. The MLL4 antisense specifically knocked down MLL4 in tumour tissue and also downregulated the expression of various growth and angiogenic factors resulting in tumour suppression. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that MLL4 is a crucial player in cell viability, cell-cycle progression and is critical for tumour growth in vivo.","['Ansari, K I', 'Kasiri, S', 'Mishra, B P', 'Mandal, S S']","['Ansari KI', 'Kasiri S', 'Mishra BP', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA.']",['eng'],"['R15 CA113747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 ES019129/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120619,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC3394987,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012263 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.263 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Jul 10;107(2):315-24. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.263.

To identify functional links between CLL cells and regulatory B10 cells, the phenotypes and abilities of leukemia cells from 93 patients with overt CLL to express IL-10 were assessed. CD5(+) CLL cells purified from 90% of the patients were IL-10-competent and secreted IL-10 following appropriate ex vivo stimulation. Serum IL-10 levels were also significantly elevated in CLL patients. IL-10-competent cell frequencies were higher among CLLs with IgV(H) mutations, and correlated positively with TCL1 expression. In the TCL1-transgenic (TCL1-Tg) mouse model of CLL, IL-10-competent B cells with the cell surface phenotype of B10 cells expanded significantly with age, preceding the development of overt, CLL-like leukemia. Malignant CLL cells in TCL1-Tg mice also shared immunoregulatory functions with mouse and human B10 cells. Serum IL-10 levels varied in TCL1-Tg mice, but in vivo low-dose lipopolysaccharide treatment induced IL-10 expression in CLL cells and high levels of serum IL-10. Thus, malignant IL-10-competent CLL cells exhibit regulatory functions comparable to normal B10 cells that may contribute to the immunosuppression observed in patients and TCL1-Tg mice.","['DiLillo, D J', 'Weinberg, J B', 'Yoshizaki, A', 'Horikawa, M', 'Bryant, J M', 'Iwata, Y', 'Matsushita, T', 'Matta, K M', 'Chen, Y', 'Venturi, G M', 'Russo, G', 'Gockerman, J P', 'Moore, J O', 'Diehl, L F', 'Volkheimer, A D', 'Friedman, D R', 'Lanasa, M C', 'Hall, R P', 'Tedder, T F']","['DiLillo DJ', 'Weinberg JB', 'Yoshizaki A', 'Horikawa M', 'Bryant JM', 'Iwata Y', 'Matsushita T', 'Matta KM', 'Chen Y', 'Venturi GM', 'Russo G', 'Gockerman JP', 'Moore JO', 'Diehl LF', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Friedman DR', 'Lanasa MC', 'Hall RP', 'Tedder TF']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['U19 AI056363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI56363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI057157/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120713,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3742013,2012/06/21 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012165 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.165 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):170-82. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.165.

Moreover, many anticancer agents induce NFkappaB nuclear translocation and activation of its target genes, which counteract cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, the design and the study of IKK-specific drugs is crucial to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and to prevent cancer drug-resistance. Here, we report the anti-proliferative effects induced by BMS-345541 (a highly selective IKK inhibitor) in three Notch1-mutated T-ALL cell lines and in T-ALL primary cells from pediatric patients. BMS-345541 induced apoptosis and an accumulation of cells in the G 2/M phase of the cell cycle via inhibition of IKK/NFkappaB signaling. We also report that T-ALL cells treated with BMS-345541 displayed nuclear translocation of FOXO3a and restoration of its functions, including control of p21(Cip1) expression levels. We demonstrated that FOXO3a subcellular re-distribution is independent of AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling, speculating that in T-ALL the loss of FOXO3a tumor suppressor function could be due to deregulation of IKK, as has been previously demonstrated in other cancer types. It is well known that, differently from p53, FOXO3a mutations have not yet been found in human tumors, which makes therapeutics activating FOXO3a more appealing than others. For these features, BMS-345541 could be used alone or in combination with traditional therapies in the treatment of T-ALL.","['Buontempo, Francesca', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Fini, Milena', 'Neri, Luca M', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Buontempo F', 'Chiarini F', 'Bressanin D', 'Tabellini G', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A', 'Fini M', 'Neri LM', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Laboratory of Preclinical and Surgical Studies, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120701,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['20859 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.20859 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Jul 1;11(13):2467-75. doi: 10.4161/cc.20859.

Sixty-four in-depth interviews were performed in three centers among 31 parents of children, 12 parents of adolescents, 12 adolescents, and 9 adult patients. Adherence was determined through a multimethod approach based on patient and/or parent responses to three self-administered questions and patient and/or parent interviews. The results were compared with physician evaluation of adherence. Factors explaining nonadherence were investigated in the in-depth interviews and by statistical analysis of self-administered questionnaires. Intentional nonadherence occurred rarely (4/52 patients, 8%) following poor tolerance of the maintenance therapy. Despite a high motivation to follow the maintenance therapy, repeated forgetfulness (8/52, 15%) was not rare and rarely detected by physicians. Nonadherence increased with age, but also existed among children. Outings, the administration of therapy at bedtime, the lack of monitoring, a low socioeconomic status, and the hepatic side effects of the treatment were also associated with nonadherence. Declared nonadherence of leukemia maintenance therapy is not negligible and should be screened at follow-up consultations using three simple questions.","['Mancini, Julien', 'Simeoni, Marie-Claude', 'Parola, Nathalie', 'Clement, Audrey', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Auquier, Pascal']","['Mancini J', 'Simeoni MC', 'Parola N', 'Clement A', 'Vey N', 'Sirvent N', 'Michel G', 'Auquier P']","['School of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France. julien.mancini@ap-hm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120619,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2012.693150 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Aug;29(5):428-39. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2012.693150.

In the present work, the effects of nilotinib resistance on K562 cells were investigated at the molecular level using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Human K562 CML cells were exposed to step-wise increasing concentrations of nilotinib, and sub-clones of K562 cells resistant to 50nM nilotinib were generated and referred to as K562/NIL-50 cells. Antiproliferative effects of nilotinib were determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. Changes in macromolecules in parental and resistant cells were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. Nilotinib resistance caused significant changes which indicated increases in the level of glycogen and membrane/lipid order. The amount of unsaturated lipids increased in the nilotinib resistant cells indicating lipid peroxidation. The total amount of lipids did not change significantly but the relative proportion of cholesterol and triglycerides altered considerably. Moreover, the transcriptional status decreased but metabolic turn-over increased as revealed by the FT-IR spectra. In addition, changes in the proteome and structural changes in both proteins and the nucleus were observed in the K562/NIL-50 cells. Protein secondary structural analyses revealed that alpha helix structure and random coil structure decreased, however, anti-parallel beta sheet structure, beta sheet structure and turns structure increased. These results indicate that the FT-IR technique provides a method for analyzing drug resistance related structural changes in leukemia and other cancer types.","['Ceylan, Cagatay', 'Camgoz, Aylin', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Ceylan C', 'Camgoz A', 'Baran Y']","['Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Food Engineering, Urla, Izmir, Turkey. cagatayceylan@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,,2012/06/21 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['product-p17965.html [pii]', '10.7785/tcrt.2012.500281 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2012 Aug;11(4):333-44. doi: 10.7785/tcrt.2012.500281.

A detailed comparison of three co-culture systems designed to mimic the CLL lymph node and vascular microenvironments were performed; two were mouse fibroblast cell lines transfected with human CD40LG or CD31 and the third was a human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. All three co-culture systems markedly enhanced CLL cell survival and induced a consistent change in CLL cell phenotype, characterized by increased expression of CD38, CD69, CD44 and ITGA4 (CD49d); this phenotype was absent following co-culture on untransfected mouse fibroblasts. In contrast to HMEC-1 cells, the CD40LG and CD31-expressing fibroblasts also induced ZAP70 expression and marked CLL cell proliferation as evidenced by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labelling and increased Ki-67 expression. Taken together, our data show that co-culture on different stroma induced a remarkably similar activation phenotype in CLL cells but only the CD40LG and CD31-expressing fibroblasts increased ZAP70 expression and CLL cell proliferation, indicating that ZAP70 may play a critical role in this process.

In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients, the high expression level of EDAG is associated with poor prognosis. NPM1 (nucleophosmin/B23), a ubiquitous nucleolar phosphoprotein, comprises a multifunctional protein that is involved in several cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, cell cycle progression, cell growth and transformation. Various studies have implicated NPM1 overexpression in promoting tumour cell proliferation, blocking the differentiation of leukaemia cells and resisting apoptosis. In the present study, using co-immunoprecipitation, we characterized EDAG as a physiological binding partner of NPM1; The N-terminal (amino acids 1-124) region of EDAG interacts with the N-terminal (amino acids 118-187) of NPM1. Under cycloheximide treatment, the stability of NPM1 protein was enhanced by EDAG overexpression, whereas knockdown of EDAG by lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA resulted in an increased degradation rate of NPM1 in K562 cells. During 4beta-phorbol l2-myristate 13-acetate-induced K562 megakaryocytic differentiation, overexpression of EDAG prevented the down-regulation of NPM1 proteins, whereas knockdown of EDAG accelerated the down-regulation of NPM1. EDAG deletion mutant lacking the binding domain with NPM1 lost the ability to stabilize NPM1 protein. Furthermore, knockdown of EDAG in K562 cells led to increased cell apoptosis induced by imatinib, and re-expression of NPM1 attenuated the increased apoptosis. These results suggest that EDAG enhances the protein stability of NPM1 via binding to NPM1, which plays a critical role in the anti-apoptosis of leukaemia cells.","['Zhang, Mei-Jiang', 'Ding, Ya-Li', 'Xu, Cheng-Wang', 'Yang, Yang', 'Lian, Wen-Xi', 'Zhan, Yi-Qun', 'Li, Wei', 'Xu, Wang-Xiang', 'Yu, Miao', 'Ge, Chang-Hui', 'Ning, Hong-Mei', 'Li, Chang-Yan', 'Yang, Xiao-Ming']","['Zhang MJ', 'Ding YL', 'Xu CW', 'Yang Y', 'Lian WX', 'Zhan YQ', 'Li W', 'Xu WX', 'Yu M', 'Ge CH', 'Ning HM', 'Li CY', 'Yang XM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120705,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,,2012/06/21 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08663.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2012 Aug;279(16):2848-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08663.x.

Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 16600-16605). Further analysis of the expression of TRAF2 and TRAF2DN in purified B cells demonstrated that expression of both endogenous TRAF2 and tg TRAF2DN was negligible in Traf2DN-tg B cells compared with wild-type mice. This was the result of proteasome-dependent degradation, and rendered TRAF2DN B cells as bona fide TRAF2-deficient B cells. Similar to B cells with targeted Traf2 deletion, Traf2DN-tg mice show expanded marginal zone B cell population and have constitutive p100 NF-kappaB2 processing. Also, TRAF3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bcl-X(L) expression levels were increased, whereas cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 levels were drastically reduced compared with those found in wild-type B cells. Moreover, consistent with previous results, we also show that TRAF2 was required for efficient JNK and ERK activation in response to CD40 engagement. However, TRAF2 was deleterious for BCR-mediated activation of these kinases. In contrast, TRAF2 deficiency had no effect on CD40-mediated p38 MAPK activation but significantly reduced BCR-mediated p38 activation. Finally, we further confirm that TRAF2 was required for CD40-mediated proliferation, but its absence relieved B cells of the need for B cell activating factor for survival. Altogether, our results suggest that TRAF2 deficiency cooperates with BCL-2 in promoting chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice, possibly by specifically enforcing marginal zone B cell accumulation, increasing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis expression, and rendering B cells independent of B cell activating factor for survival.","['Perez-Chacon, Gema', 'Llobet, David', 'Pardo, Constanza', 'Pindado, Jose', 'Choi, Yongwon', 'Reed, John C', 'Zapata, Juan M']","['Perez-Chacon G', 'Llobet D', 'Pardo C', 'Pindado J', 'Choi Y', 'Reed JC', 'Zapata JM']","['Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA163743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI069356/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI070859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA163743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC3526975,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200814 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200814 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jul 15;189(2):1053-61. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200814.

However, the mechanism responsible for its cell type-specific regulation under non-stimulated conditions is poorly understood. To analyze the variation of PML expression, we utilized three human cell types, BJ fibroblasts and HeLa and U2OS cell lines, each with a distinct PML expression pattern. Analysis of JAK-STAT signaling in the three cell lines revealed differences in levels of activated STAT3 but not STAT1 correlating with PML mRNA and protein levels. RNAi-mediated knockdown of STAT3 decreased PML expression; both STAT3 level/activity and PML expression relied on IL6 secreted into culture media. We mapped the IL6-responsive sequence to an ISRE(-595/-628) element of the PML promoter. The PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB branch of IL6 signaling showed also cell-type dependence, being highest in BJ, intermediate in HeLa, and lowest in U2OS cells and correlated with IL6 secretion. RNAi-mediated knockdown of NEMO (NF-kappa-B essential modulator), a key component of NFkappaB activation, suppressed NFkappaB targets LMP2 and IRF1 together with STAT3 and PML. Combined knockdown of STAT3 and NEMO did not further promote PML suppression, and it can be bypassed by exogenous IL6, indicating the NF-kappaB pathway acts upstream of JAK-STAT3 through induction of IL6. Our results indicate that the cell type-specific activity of IL6 signaling pathways governs PML expression under unperturbed growth conditions. As IL6 is induced in response to various viral and genotoxic stresses, this cytokine may regulate autocrine/paracrine induction of PML under these pathophysiological states as part of tissue adaptation to local stress.","['Hubackova, Sona', 'Krejcikova, Katerina', 'Bartek, Jiri', 'Hodny, Zdenek']","['Hubackova S', 'Krejcikova K', 'Bartek J', 'Hodny Z']","['Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3411009,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47865-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.316869 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 3;287(32):26702-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.316869.

Apoptosis appears to be a major mechanism for both agents to exert anti-cancer activity. The purpose of the present study was designed to determine whether the apoptotic effect on human cancer cells can be enhanced by combining curcumin with MSeA. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine by flow cytometry. Expression of protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Localization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was detected by immunocytochemistry. RNA interference was employed to inhibit expression of specific protein. We found here that combining curcumin with MSeA led to a significantly enhanced apoptosis in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that curcumin treatment alone caused a concentration dependent upregulation of Mcl-1, which can be overcome by combining it with MSeA. In line with the Mcl-1 reduction, an enhanced mitochondrial permeability transition and AIF nuclear translocation by the combination were achieved. In addition, an increased suppression of focal adhesion kinase activity was observed in the combination-treated cells which were associated with cell detachment-induced apoptosis by the combination. Our findings suggest that curcumin/MSeA combination holds excellent potential for improving their efficacy against human breast and prostate cancer through enhanced apoptosis induction.","['Guo, Xiao', 'Yin, Shutao', 'Dong, Yinhui', 'Fan, Lihong', 'Ye, Min', 'Lu, Junxuan', 'Hu, Hongbo']","['Guo X', 'Yin S', 'Dong Y', 'Fan L', 'Ye M', 'Lu J', 'Hu H']","['Division of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University, Haidian District, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,,2012/06/20 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.21933 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2013 Nov;52(11):879-89. doi: 10.1002/mc.21933.

Clinical trials have reported a 25% incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in patients receiving bendamustine. While these reactions are well documented, there is no consensus on the optimal premedication regimen for the prevention of these adverse effects. At our center, we utilize a regimen of ondansetron 16 mg orally and dexamethasone 10 mg IV push prior to each infusion of bendamustine. This report describes our experience with our current premedication regimen with regard to IRRs and the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 73 consecutive patients receiving bendamustine infusions at our institute from June 2008 to June 2010 to determine the incidence of IRRs and FN. The primary objective was to determine the incidence of IRRs. Secondary objectives included incidence of FN and hospital admission rate. RESULTS: A total of 478 infusions of bendamustine were administered to 73 consecutive patients. The median patient age was 69 years. IRRs affected 19% of our population, and 10.9% experienced FN. Notably, all IRRs were attributed to rituximab infusions and no patients experienced an IRR when receiving bendamustine alone. This compares favorably to the initial reported IRRs of 25% with bendamustine alone. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience with bendamustine, ondansetron and dexamethasone provide a safe and effective prevention of IRRs associated with bendamustine. By avoiding the use of other premedications, the likelihood of additional complications or adverse affects can be minimized.","['Tombleson, Rebecca L', 'Ho, Viet', 'Sokol, Lubomir', 'Pinilla, Javier', 'Wetzstein, Gene A']","['Tombleson RL', 'Ho V', 'Sokol L', 'Pinilla J', 'Wetzstein GA']","['Department of Pharmacy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

This study aimed to investigate neopterin levels during childhood leukemia treatment and neutropenic fever episodes for the possibility of using as a marker for disease activity and differentiation of infections. A total of 44 children with acute leukemia, 19 children with infection (control group 1) and 21 healthy children (control group 2) were studied. Median serum neopterin level before induction chemotherapy (day 0) in 25 children (patient group 1) was significantly higher (27.7 nmol/L) than those at the beginning of 30 febrile episodes in 19 children in bone marrow remission (2.2 nmol/L) (patient group 2) and in control group 2 (0.4 nmol/L) (p< 0.05). It was (27.7 nmol/L) also significantly higher in control group 1 than in patient group 2 and control group 2 (p< 0.05). Serum neopterin levels at day 15 (2.1 mmol/L) and day 33 (0.4 mmol/L) of induction were significantly lower than day 0 of ALL subgroup at patient group 1. There were no significant difference in neopterin levels between days 0, 3 and 5 of neutropenic fever as well as between patients with microbiologically and/or clinically documented infections and those with fever of unknown origin in patient group 2 (p> 0.05). Serum neopterin did not show significant correlation with absolute neutrophil count and absolute monocyte count (p> 0.05).

The CML is nowadays successfully treated with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors as imatinib and dasatinib. In the CML-derived K562 cell line, low concentrations of imatinib induce proliferative arrest and erythroid differentiation. We found that imatinib upregulated the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1) (p27) in a time- and -concentration dependent manner, and that the extent of imatinib-mediated differentiation was severely decreased in cells with depleted p27. MYC (c-Myc) is a transcription factor frequently deregulated in human cancer. MYC is overexpressed in untreated CML and is associated to poor response to imatinib. Using K562 sublines with conditional MYC expression (induced by Zn(2+) or activated by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen) we show that MYC prevented the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib and dasatinib. The differentiation inhibition is not due to increased proliferation of MYC-expressing clones or enhanced apoptosis of differentiated cells. As p27 overexpression is reported to induce erythroid differentiation in K562, we explored the effect of MYC on imatinib-dependent induction of p27. We show that MYC abrogated the imatinib-induced upregulation of p27 concomitantly with the differentiation inhibition, suggesting that MYC inhibits differentiation by antagonizing the imatinib-mediated upregulation of p27. This effect occurs mainly by p27 protein destabilization. This was in part due to MYC-dependent induction of SKP2, a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets p27 for degradation. The results suggest that, although MYC deregulation does not directly confer resistance to imatinib, it might be a factor that contributes to progression of CML through the inhibition of differentiation.","['Gomez-Casares, M T', 'Garcia-Alegria, E', 'Lopez-Jorge, C E', 'Ferrandiz, N', 'Blanco, R', 'Alvarez, S', 'Vaque, J P', 'Bretones, G', 'Caraballo, J M', 'Sanchez-Bailon, P', 'Delgado, M D', 'Martin-Perez, J', 'Cigudosa, J C', 'Leon, J']","['Gomez-Casares MT', 'Garcia-Alegria E', 'Lopez-Jorge CE', 'Ferrandiz N', 'Blanco R', 'Alvarez S', 'Vaque JP', 'Bretones G', 'Caraballo JM', 'Sanchez-Bailon P', 'Delgado MD', 'Martin-Perez J', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Leon J']","['Servicio de Hematologia and Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Dr Negrin, Las Palmas, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/06/20 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012246 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.246 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Apr 25;32(17):2239-46. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.246.

In this study, we conducted a Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis screen in Rassf1a-null mice to identify candidate genes that collaborate with loss of Rassf1a in tumorigenesis. We identified 10 genes, including the transcription factor Runx2, a transcriptional partner of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) that displays tumor suppressive activity through competing with the oncogenic TEA domain family of transcription factors (TEAD) for YAP1 association. While loss of RASSF1A promoted the formation of oncogenic YAP1-TEAD complexes, the combined loss of both RASSF1A and RUNX2 further increased YAP1-TEAD levels, showing that loss of RASSF1A, together with RUNX2, is consistent with the multistep model of tumorigenesis. Clinically, RUNX2 expression was frequently downregulated in various cancers, and reduced RUNX2 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell or atypical Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphomas. Interestingly, decreased expression levels of RASSF1 and RUNX2 were observed in both precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and colorectal cancer, further supporting the hypothesis that dual regulation of YAP1-TEAD promotes oncogenic activity. Together, our findings provide evidence that loss of RASSF1A expression switches YAP1 from a tumor suppressor to an oncogene through regulating its association with transcription factors, thereby suggesting a novel mechanism for RASSF1A-mediated tumor suppression.","['van der Weyden, Louise', 'Papaspyropoulos, Angelos', 'Poulogiannis, George', 'Rust, Alistair G', 'Rashid, Mamunur', 'Adams, David J', 'Arends, Mark J', ""O'Neill, Eric""]","['van der Weyden L', 'Papaspyropoulos A', 'Poulogiannis G', 'Rust AG', 'Rashid M', 'Adams DJ', 'Arends MJ', ""O'Neill E""]","['Experimental Cancer Genetics, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.', 'Division of Signal Transduction, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', ""Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QQ, UK."", 'Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['082356/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'C20510/A6997/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6997/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A9318/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'AI2932/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '13031/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC4067151,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3343 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 1;72(15):3817-3827. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3343.

However, an understanding of the mechanisms that cause aberrant miRNA transcriptional control is lacking. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the role and extent of miRNA epigenetic regulation in CLL. Genome-wide profiling conducted on 24 CLL and 10 healthy B cell samples revealed global DNA methylation patterns upstream of miRNA sequences that distinguished malignant from healthy cells and identified putative miRNA promoters. Integration of DNA methylation and miRNA promoter data led to the identification of 128 recurrent miRNA targets for aberrant promoter DNA methylation. DNA hypomethylation accounted for more than 60% of all aberrant promoter-associated DNA methylation in CLL, and promoter DNA hypomethylation was restricted to well-defined regions. Individual hyper- and hypomethylated promoters allowed discrimination of CLL samples from healthy controls. Promoter DNA methylation patterns were confirmed in an independent patient cohort, with 11 miRNAs consistently showing an inverse correlation between DNA methylation status and expression level. Together, our findings characterize the role of epigenetic changes in the regulation of miRNA transcription and create a repository of disease-specific promoter regions that may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Baer, Constance', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Frenzel, Lukas P', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Park, Yoon Jung', 'Gu, Lei', 'Weichenhan, Dieter', 'Fischer, Martina', 'Pallasch, Christian Philipp', 'Herpel, Esther', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Byrd, John C', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Baer C', 'Claus R', 'Frenzel LP', 'Zucknick M', 'Park YJ', 'Gu L', 'Weichenhan D', 'Fischer M', 'Pallasch CP', 'Herpel E', 'Rehli M', 'Byrd JC', 'Wendtner CM', 'Plass C']","['Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120618,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-0803 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0803 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 1;72(15):3775-85. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0803.

Several studies have reported that its extracts exhibit anticancer, antioxidative and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. However, the effects of this plant on human prostate cancer cells have not yet been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of a methanol extract of Sanguisorba officinalis (MESO) in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. MESO significantly decreased cell growth and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. MESO decreased the expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl2like anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in various cancer cell lines. Expression levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were increased by MESO whereas those of Bak and Bcl-xL were unchanged. In addition, MESO induced the oligomerization of Bax in the mitochondrial outer membrane. These results suggest that MESO inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells and induces apoptotic cell death by the downregulation of Mcl-1 protein expression and the oligomerization of Bax. Therefore, MESO has potential as a drug candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.","['Choi, Eun-Sun', 'Kim, Jun-Sung', 'Kwon, Ki-Han', 'Kim, Hyng-Seop', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Choi ES', 'Kim JS', 'Kwon KH', 'Kim HS', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2012.949 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2012 Sep;6(3):670-4. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2012.949.

Seventeen patients had the ovarian cortex retrieved when they were in complete remission. Before transplantation, 4 of 7 pieces (2 from patients in complete remission) of ovarian cortex had a positive RT-quantitative PCR. After transplantation, none of the mice revealed any sign of disease, neither in the pieces of ovarian cortex transplanted nor in any of the murine organs evaluated. Thus, the ovaries from patients in complete remission do not appear to contain viable malignant cells contrasting ovarian tissue retrieved before treatment.","['Greve, Tine', 'Clasen-Linde, Erik', 'Andersen, Morten T', 'Andersen, Mette K', 'Sorensen, Stine D', 'Rosendahl, Mikkel', 'Ralfkiaer, Elisabeth', 'Andersen, Claus Yding']","['Greve T', 'Clasen-Linde E', 'Andersen MT', 'Andersen MK', 'Sorensen SD', 'Rosendahl M', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Andersen CY']","['Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Rigshospitalet-Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. tinegreve@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/20 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)51626-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-403022 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Nov 22;120(22):4311-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-403022.

Any retrospective or prospective HSCT study that enrolls patients across disease types must account for this heterogeneity; yet, current methods are neither standardized nor validated. We conducted a retrospective study of 1539 patients who underwent transplantation at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000 to 2009. Using multivariable models for overall survival, we created a disease risk index. This tool uses readily available information about disease and disease status to categorize patients into 4 risk groups with significantly different overall survival and progression-free survival on the basis of primarily differences in the relapse risk. This scheme applies regardless of conditioning intensity, is independent of comorbidity index, and was validated in an independent cohort of 672 patients from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. This simple and validated scheme could be used to risk-stratify patients in both retrospective and prospective HSCT studies, to calibrate HSCT outcomes across studies and centers, and to promote the design of HSCT clinical trials that enroll patients across diseases and disease states, increasing our ability to study nondisease-specific outcomes in HSCT.","['Armand, Philippe', 'Gibson, Christopher J', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Koreth, John', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Kim, Haesook T']","['Armand P', 'Gibson CJ', 'Cutler C', 'Ho VT', 'Koreth J', 'Alyea EP', 'Ritz J', 'Sorror ML', 'Lee SJ', 'Deeg HJ', 'Storer BE', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Kim HT']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave., Boston, MA 02215, USA. parmand@partners.org']",['eng'],"['P01 HL070149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HL088021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 HL088021/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20120618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3412351,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46590-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-418202 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):905-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-418202.

Extraction of the drug from tissues was performed by solvent extraction and the obtained extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring mode. The developed method was validated according to the criteria for bioanalytical method, showing good performances in terms of lower limit of quantification (LLOQ=0.02mugml(-1)), linearity (R(2)=0.998), repeatability (RSD<3%), reproducibility (RSD<13%) and recovery (RR>89%). The developed method was then applied to the analysis of heart and liver of rats treated with different doses of IM, with and without the simultaneous administration of carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent with cardioprotective effect, in order to evaluate tissue levels of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The obtained results revealed that the amount of IM in the rat heart was significantly affected by the administered dose, whereas carvedilol had no effect on IM concentrations. Thus, we have developed a method that allows the detection of IM traces in complex tissues such as the heart and liver and that may be proposed for the determination of the drug in other clinically relevant biological samples.","['Bianchi, F', 'Caffarri, E', 'Cavalli, S', 'Lagrasta, C', 'Musci, M', 'Quaini, F', 'Savi, M']","['Bianchi F', 'Caffarri E', 'Cavalli S', 'Lagrasta C', 'Musci M', 'Quaini F', 'Savi M']","['Dipartimento di Chimica Generale ed Inorganica, Chimica Analitica, Chimica Fisica, Universita degli Studi di Parma, Parco Area delle Scienze 17/A, 43124 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120601,England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,,2012/06/20 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0731-7085(12)00328-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2013 Jan 25;73:103-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.034.

There is consistent evidence of the role of Kaiso and its involvement in human tumorigenesis but there is no evidence about its role in hematopoietic differentiation or establishment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We used, normal K562 cell line, established from a CML patient in blast crisis, and imatinib-resistant K562 cell line, to investigate the specific distribution of Kaiso and their contribution to the cell differentiation status of the blast crisis of CML (CML-BP). RESULTS: We found cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso, in K562 cells and patients, confirmed by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and western blot of cytoplasmic protein fraction. Kaiso was weakly expressed in the imatinib-resistant K562 cell line confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot. The cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso was not modified when the K562 cells were treated for 16 h with imatinib 0.1 and 1 muM. In our study, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was introduced to down regulate the expression of Kaiso and p120ctn in K562 cell line. Kaiso and p120ctn were down regulated individually (siRNA-Kaiso or siRNA-p120ctn) or in combination using a simultaneous co-transfection (siRNA-Kaiso/p120ctn). We next investigated whether knockdown either Kaiso or p120ctn alone or in combination affects the cell differentiation status in K562 cells. After down regulation we analyzed the expression of hematopoietic cell differentiation and proliferation genes: SCF, PU-1, c-MyB, C/EBPalpha, Gata-2 and maturation markers of hematopoietic cells expressed in the plasma membrane: CD15, CD11b, CD33, CD117. The levels of SCF and c-MyB were increased by 1000% and 65% respectively and PU-1, Gata-2 and C/EBPalpha were decreased by 66%, 50% and 80% respectively, when Kaiso levels were down regulated by siRNA. The results were similar when both Kaiso and p120ctn were down regulated by siRNA. The increased expression of SCF and decreased expression of GATA-2 could be responsible by the higher cell viability detected in K562 cells double knock-down of both Kaiso and p120ctn. Finally, we studied the effect of knock-down either Kaiso or p120ctn, alone or in combination on CD15, CD11b, CD33 and Cd117 expression. Using siRNA approach a reduction of 35%, 8% and 13% in CD15, CD33 and CD117 levels respectively, were achieved in all transfections, when compared to scrambled knock-down cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both Kaiso and p120ctn, contributes to maintaining the differentiated state of the K562 cells and similar to other cancers, cytoplasmic localization of Kaiso is related to a poor prognosis in CML-BP. By the broad and profound effects on the expression of genes and markers of hematopoietic differentiation produced by Kaiso knock-down, these findings reveal Kaiso as a potential target for selective therapy of CML.","['Cofre, Jaime', 'Menezes, Joao R L', 'Pizzatti, Luciana', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['Cofre J', 'Menezes JR', 'Pizzatti L', 'Abdelhay E']","['Laboratorio de Embriologia Molecular e Cancer, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Sala 313b, CEP 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. jaimecofre@yahoo.com.br.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120618,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC3461418,2012/06/20 06:00,2012/06/20 06:01,['2012/06/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-12-28 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-12-28 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2012 Jun 18;12(1):28. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-12-28.,20121002,10.1186/1475-2867-12-28 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we evaluated SFN's effects on imatinib (IM)-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). CD34(+)/CD38(-) and CD34(+)/CD38(+) LSCs were isolated from KU812 cell line flowcytometrically. Isolated LSCs showed high expression of Oct4, CD133, beta-catenin, and Sox2 and IM resistance. Differentially, CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs demonstrated higher BCR-ABL and beta-catenin expression and imatinib (IM) resistance than CD34(+)/CD38(+) counterparts. IM and SFN combined treatment sensitized CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs and induced apoptosis, shown by increased caspase 3, PARP, and Bax while decreased Bcl-2 expression. Additionally, the combined treatment reduced BCR-ABL and beta-catenin and MDR-1 protein expression. Mechanistically, IM and SFN combined treatment resensitized LSCs by inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, beta-catenin-silenced LSCs exhibited reduced glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) expression and intracellular GSH level, which led to increased sensitivity toward IM and SFN. We demonstrated that IM and SFN combined treatment effectively eliminated CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs.

The present WHO 2008 classification has separated two groups in MPAL based on t(9;22) positivity and MLL rearrangement. AIMS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present pilot study is to note the frequency of BCR-ABL transcript in MPAL cases using the RT-PCR assay and to correlate the status with hematological remission post induction. MATERIALS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHODS: A total of 10 MPAL cases classified on Flow-cytometry based on the current WHO 2008 criteria were enrolled. In all the cases Bone marrow or peripheral blood sample in EDTA was processed for molecular studies and the RT-PCR reaction carried out using primers specific to the t (9;22) and t(4;11) translocation. The post induction check marrow slides were also reviewed. RESULTS: Out of the total 10 MPAL cases, 7/10 (70%) were adult and 3/10 (30%) pediatric cases. A total of 4/10 (40%) cases showed positivity for the t(9;22) transcript and none for t (4;11). Of the 4 positive cases, 3/10(30%) were adult cases and 1/10(10%) pediatric case. The BCR-ABL transcript type in adult cases was b3a2 (p210) in 2/3 (66%) and e1a2 (p190) in 1/3 (33.3%) case. The single pediatric case was positive for b3a2 transcript. DISCUSSION #ENTITYSTARTX00026; CONCLUSION: All the 4 positive MPAL cases presented with high TLC and low platelet count (p<0.05). The positive cases also showed hematological remission at post induction check marrow (blasts<5%).

More than 50 mutations at the terminal exon of the NPM1 gene have been identified so far in acute myeloid leukemia; the mutated proteins are aberrantly and stably localized in the cytoplasm due to high destabilization of the NPM1 C-terminal domain and the appearance of a new nuclear export signal. We have shown previously that the 70-residue NPM1 C-terminal domain (NPM1-C70) is able to bind with high affinity a specific region at the c-MYC gene promoter characterized by parallel G-quadruplex structure. Here we present the solution structure of the NPM1-C70 domain and NMR analysis of its interaction with a c-MYC-derived G-quadruplex. These data were used to calculate an experimentally restrained molecular docking model for the complex. The NPM1-C70 terminal three-helix bundle binds the G-quadruplex DNA at the interface between helices H1 and H2 through electrostatic interactions with the G-quadruplex phosphate backbone. Furthermore, we show that the 17-residue lysine-rich sequence at the N terminus of the three-helix bundle is disordered and, although necessary, does not participate directly in the contact surface in the complex.","['Gallo, Angelo', 'Lo Sterzo, Carlo', 'Mori, Mirko', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Bertini, Ivano', 'Banci, Lucia', 'Brunori, Maurizio', 'Federici, Luca']","['Gallo A', 'Lo Sterzo C', 'Mori M', 'Di Matteo A', 'Bertini I', 'Banci L', 'Brunori M', 'Federici L']","['Magnetic Resonance Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Florence, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3410995,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47851-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.371013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 3;287(32):26539-48. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.371013.

The patient received allogenic bone marrow transplantation, which unfortunately, did not prevent the patient to relapse with an undifferentiated sarcoma containing rhabdomyosarcoma components, as well as reappearance of a residual teratoma with metastasis. The treatment strategy for malignant transformation of a GCT seems to be unpredictable and should be dictated by the malignant tissue counterpart. Except for acute leukaemia, unresectable or metastatic settings will generally require multi-modal therapy including chemotherapy, in addition to loco regional approaches.

Furthermore, alternate therapy, for example, second-line TKIs, can impose a huge economic burden on a healthcare system.

We performed a population-based study of APL in the United States to determine its incidence and relative survival (RS) during a 34-year period. METHODS: We identified 1397 patients diagnosed with APL between 1975 and 2008 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were categorized into 4 age groups and 3 calendar periods. As a comparison, we also reviewed the outcome of APL patients treated at our institution during approximately the same time interval. RESULTS: The incidences of APL increased with time period and patient age. Short- and long-term RS improved with each calendar period, with the greatest improvement occurring between 1991 and 1999; 5-year RS rates were 0.18 for patients diagnosed in 1975-1990, 0.52 in 1991-1999, and 0.64 in 2000-2008. Age was an important predictor of survival. For example, the 5-year RS rate in patients diagnosed in 2000-2008 was 0.38 for patients aged >/= 60 years and 0.73 and 0.75 for patients aged <20 years and 20-39 years, respectively. Similar treads of improvements in the survival were observed in APL patients treated at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of APL has increased, especially in the last decade. Clinical outcome improved remarkably in patients with APL diagnosed from 1991 to 1999, mainly because of the increased use of all-trans retinoic acid.","['Chen, Yiming', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Wang, Haijun', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Chen Y', 'Kantarjian H', 'Wang H', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120615,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC4180246,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27623 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 1;118(23):5811-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27623.

Although IOL contains various subtypes of lymphoma, the most frequent subtype is diffuse large B-cell type lymphoma.

Recently, serological and molecular pathological studies have been carried out in addition to morphological examination.

Most benign LR-PE are predominantly composed of T(CD3+) cells while most malignant LR-PE are of B(CD20+) cell lineage. As part of the effort to contain laboratory costs and improve diagnostic accuracy, there is increasing interest in applying principles of evidence-based pathology to the use of immunostains. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the effectiveness of CD3/CD20 immunostains as a diagnostic or triage tool during the initial evaluation of 258 consecutive LR-PE. 196 (76%) of the LR-PE were ultimately diagnosed as reactive lymphocytosis and 62 (24%) as lymphoma/leukemia (L/L). There was a previous diagnosis of L/L, concurrent diagnostic tissue, and/or clinical evidence of L/L in 44 (71%) of the L/L effusions. An initial diagnosis of L/L was made in the remaining 18 (29%) cases. Sixteen of these 18 cases showed large cells with high-grade features that mandated L/L workup. In only 2 (0.8%) of the 258 LR-PE, CD3/CD20 stains were helpful to identify small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in patients without concurrent peripheral lymphocytosis. CD3/CD20 immunostains do not appear to provide a cost-effective method to diagnose or triage the vast majority of LR-PE submitted to a clinical cytology laboratory. An algorithm that considers history, blood counts, and cytomorphology allows for cost-effective selection of LR-PE that warrant comprehensive hematopathologic workup. Our findings underscore the feasibility of applying evidence-based principles to develop guidelines for the cost-effective utilization of immunostains in cytology.","['Walts, Ann E', 'Marchevsky, Alberto M']","['Walts AE', 'Marchevsky AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. walts@cshs.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101122,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dc.21578 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2012 Jul;40(7):565-9. doi: 10.1002/dc.21578.

The intrinsic molecular and signaling mechanisms involved are, however, poorly documented. Drug targeting of such translocation event performed by circulating microbes and immune cells may prevent secondary cerebral infections and development of brain pathologies. In this study, we specifically investigated the in vitro targeting efficacy of the chemopreventive and dietary-derived epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) molecule on the NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional regulation of a panel of 89 biomarkers associated with promyelocytic HL-60 differentiation into macrophages. NF-kappaB-mediated signaling during HL-60 macrophage differentiation was reversed by EGCG, in part through reduced IkappaB phosphorylation and led to the inhibition of moderately to highly expressed NF-kappaB gene targets among which the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. In contrast, EGCG exhibited low efficacy in reversing NF-kappaB-regulated genes and showed selective antagonism toward COX-2 expression while that of MMP-9 remained high in terminally differentiated macrophages. Decreased expression of the 67-kDa non-integrin Laminin Receptor in terminally differentiated macrophages may explain such differential EGCG efficacy. Our results suggest that terminally differentiated macrophage transendothelial migration associated with neuroinflammation may not be pharmacologically affected by such a specific class of flavonoid. The differentiation status of a given in vitro cell model must therefore be carefully considered for optimized assessment of therapeutic drugs.","['Vezina, Amelie', 'Chokor, Rima', 'Annabi, Borhane']","['Vezina A', 'Chokor R', 'Annabi B']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Departement de Chimie, Centre de Recherche BioMED, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, C.P. 8888, Succ.

These risks may be even higher among tobacco-related cancer survivors (TRCS). We describe tobacco use behaviors among TRCS, other cancer survivors, and people without a history of cancer. METHODS: We used 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to describe demographic characteristics, smoking history, current smoking prevalence, and smokeless tobacco use among TRCS, other cancer survivors, and people without a history of cancer (cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use were calculated after adjusting for age, sex, race, and insurance status). Tobacco-related cancers were defined as lung/bronchial, pharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, kidney/renal, urinary bladder, cervical, and acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: A total of 20 % of all cancer survivors were TRCS. TRCS were primarily female (68 %) and white (78 %). Smoking prevalence was higher among TRCS (27 %) compared with other cancer survivors (16 %) and respondents without a history of cancer (18 %). Smokeless tobacco use was higher among respondents without a history of cancer (4 %) compared with TRCS (3 %) and other cancer survivors (3 %). CONCLUSIONS: The self-reported smoking prevalence among TRCS is higher than among other cancer survivors and people without a history of cancer. Targeted smoking prevention and cessation interventions are needed for cancer survivors, especially those diagnosed with a tobacco-related cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: We recommend all cancer survivors be made aware of the health risks associated with smoking after a cancer diagnosis, and smoking cessation services be offered to those who currently smoke. We provide the first population-based report on demographic characteristics and tobacco use behaviors among self-reported tobacco-related cancer survivors.","['Underwood, J Michael', 'Townsend, Julie S', 'Tai, Eric', 'White, Arica', 'Davis, Shane P', 'Fairley, Temeika L']","['Underwood JM', 'Townsend JS', 'Tai E', 'White A', 'Davis SP', 'Fairley TL']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA. jmunderwood@cdc.gov']",['eng'],['CC999999/ImCDC/Intramural CDC HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120616,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,PMC4591959,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-012-0230-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2012 Sep;6(3):333-44. doi: 10.1007/s11764-012-0230-1.

The aim of this work was to study the expression of HSP 90 and apoptotic proteins, the effects in culture of 17-AAG on cell survival and apoptosis and to compare Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL to common B cell ALL, in ALL cell lines and in patients' cells collected at ALL diagnosis. METHODS: We analysed 2 ALL cell lines and 63 leukaemic samples from patients treated in our institution (44 common B cell ALL and 19 Ph+ ALL). We performed flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow aspiration and cell lines with a combination of anti-HSP90, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl antibodies. Apoptosis after cell culture (in presence or not of 17-AAG) was assessed using Annexin V and activated caspase-3 staining. RESULTS: Ph+ ALL cells appeared to be more sensitive to 17-AAG cytotoxicity with a 100 % mortality rate after exposure to 10 muM for 24 h (vs. 62 % for B-common ALL). A high percentage of HSP90-positive cells (in Ph+ ALL samples) was associated with high sensitivity to 17-AAG. 17-AAG induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and was associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl expression and up-regulation of Bax expression. CONCLUSION: Considering that Bcr-Abl constitutes HSP 90 substrates, HSP 90 inhibition could be of particular interest for Ph+ ALL disease, even in patients harbouring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Flandrin-Gresta, Pascale', 'Solly, Francoise', 'Rigollet, Lauren', 'Cornillon, Jerome', 'Augeul-Meunier, Karine', 'Stephan, Jean-Louis', 'Montmartin, Aurelie', 'Viallet, Annie', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Campos, Lydia']","['Tavernier E', 'Flandrin-Gresta P', 'Solly F', 'Rigollet L', 'Cornillon J', 'Augeul-Meunier K', 'Stephan JL', 'Montmartin A', 'Viallet A', 'Guyotat D', 'Campos L']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut de Cancerologie Lucien Neuwirth, 108 bis avenue Albert Raimond, 42270 Saint Priest en Jarez, France. emmanuelle.tavernier@icloire.fr""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120617,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/02/12 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-012-1247-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Oct;138(10):1753-8. doi: 10.1007/s00432-012-1247-6.

BRAF p.V600E mutation was recently described as a molecular marker of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). We developed and validated a pyrosequencing-based approach that covers BRAF mutational hotspots in exons 11 (codon 468) and 15 (codons 595 to 600). The assay detects BRAF mutations at an analytical sensitivity of 5%. We screened 16 unenriched archived bone marrow aspirate samples from patients with a diagnosis of HCL (n = 12) and hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-v) (n = 4) using pyrosequencing. BRAF p.V600E mutation was present in all HCL cases and absent in all HCL-v. Our data support the recent finding that BRAF p.V600E mutation is universally present in HCL. Moreover, our pyrosequencing-based assay provides a convenient, rapid, sensitive, and quantitative tool for the detection of BRAF p.V600E mutations in HCL for clinical diagnostic testing.","['Verma, Shalini', 'Greaves, Wesley O', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Reddy, Neelima', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Patel, Keyur P']","['Verma S', 'Greaves WO', 'Ravandi F', 'Reddy N', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Thomas DA', 'Kantarjian H', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Luthra R', 'Patel KP']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Naomi St. Facility (NAO1.053a), 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0149, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,PMC5465956,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['138/1/153 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPL0OPXI9LZITV [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2012 Jul;138(1):153-6. doi: 10.1309/AJCPL0OPXI9LZITV.,20130118,10.1309/AJCPL0OPXI9LZITV [doi],,,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics']",['NIHMS860813'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information on folic acid supplementation was obtained by standardized telephone interview. The genotypes were obtained using high-throughput platforms and imputation for untyped polymorphisms. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: AL was significantly inversely associated with maternal folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy (OR = 0.4; 95 % confidence interval: [0.3-0.6]). MTHFR and MTRR genetic polymorphisms were not associated with AL. However, AL was positively associated with homozygosity for any of the MTHFR polymorphisms and carriership of both MTRR variant alleles (OR = 1.6 [0.9-3.1]). No interaction was observed between MTHFR, MTRR, and maternal folate supplementation. CONCLUSION: The study findings support the hypothesis that maternal folic acid supplementation may reduce the risk of childhood AL. The findings also suggest that the genotype homozygous for any of the MTHFR variants and carrying both MTRR variants could be a risk factor for AL.","['Amigou, Alicia', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Haouy, Stephanie', 'Chastagner, Pascal', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Rialland, Xavier', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Amigou A', 'Rudant J', 'Orsi L', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Plat G', 'Michel G', 'Haouy S', 'Chastagner P', 'Ducassou S', 'Rialland X', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer, INSERM U1018, Villejuif, France. alicia.amigou@inserm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120616,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0004-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Aug;23(8):1265-77. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0004-0.

CADM1/TSLC1 expression is reduced in a variety of cancers via promoter methylation, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential. In contrast, we observed that CADM1/TSLC1 is highly and ectopically expressed in all primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and in most human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV)-1-infected T-cell and ATLL cell lines. No expression, however, was detected in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or in several other non-HTLV-1-infected leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified that high CADM1/TSLC1 expression plays an important role in enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, tumor growth and the ability of ATLL cells to infiltrate organs. We developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1<sup>+</sup> ATLL cells. Using flow cytometry, we determined that CADM1/TSLC1 is present on the surface of ATLL cells. The percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CADM1<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients was highly correlated with the DNA copy number of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes. In particular, we identified the soluble form of CADM1/TSLC1 in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. Therefore, measurements of soluble CADM1/TSLC1 serum levels and the detection of CD4<sup>+</sup>CADM1<sup>+</sup> cells in the blood, when combined with standard diagnostic methods, would be useful for identifying and monitoring disease progression in HTLV-1 carriers. Such tests would provide increased accuracy and may aid in early diagnosis and in determining the effects of ATLL treatments.","['Nakahata, Shingo', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Nakahata S', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/52.17 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.52.17 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2012;52(1):17-22. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.52.17.,20121018,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/therapy/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is aberrantly activated, suggesting that the increased pathway activity may be correlated with the development and prognosis of MDS. SOX7 protein, encoded by the sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) gene, inhibits the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Because the DNA methylation can regulate the transcription of SOX7 gene, we used the methylation-specific PCR to investigate the methylation status of the CpG island in MDS patients to determine the potential correlation of the SOX7 methylation with the development and prognosis of MDS. We found that the CpG island of the SOX7 gene was methylated in 58.1% (97/167) of MDS patients, but not in any healthy control. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene was significantly higher in patients at advanced stages of MDS than in the patients at early stages. The increased percentages of this SOX7 methylation were also correlated with age, marrow blast levels, and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk. After prognostic analysis, we found that patients with the methylated CpG island of the SOX7 gene had shorter overall survival and cumulative survival than patients with unmethylated CpG island.

MRD monitoring was centrally evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (4.5 log sensitivity). After the first course of imatinib-based chemotherapy, 33 patients (34.7%) achieved at least major molecular response. On the basis of MRD kinetics by the end of two courses of imatinib-based chemotherapy, we stratified entire patients into four subgroups: early-stable molecular responders (EMRs, n=33), late molecular responders (LMRs, n=35), intermediate molecular responders (IMRs, n=9) and poor molecular responders (PMRs, n=18). Multivariate analysis showed that the most powerful factor affecting long-term transplantation outcome was MRD kinetics. Compared with EMRs, IMRs or PMRs had significantly higher risk of treatment failure in terms of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS). LMRs had a tendency toward a lower DFS. Quantitative monitoring of MRD kinetics during the first-line imatinib-based chemotherapy course is useful in identifying subgroups of Ph-positive ALL transplants at a high risk of relapse.","['Lee, S', 'Kim, D-W', 'Cho, B-S', 'Yoon, J-H', 'Shin, S-H', 'Yahng, S-A', 'Lee, S-E', 'Eom, K-S', 'Kim, Y-J', 'Chung, N-G', 'Kim, H-J', 'Min, C-K', 'Lee, J-W', 'Min, W-S', 'Park, C-W']","['Lee S', 'Kim DW', 'Cho BS', 'Yoon JH', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Lee SE', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Chung NG', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic BMT Center, Research Institute of Molecular Genetics, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. leeseok@catholic.ac.kr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012164 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.164 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2367-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.164.

We analyzed the presence of FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations as well as FLT3 expression levels in 54 newly diagnosed patients with B-ALL (n=49) or T-ALL (n=5). All B/T-ALL samples tested negative for the presence of FLT3-TKD or FLT3-ITD. None of the T-ALL and E2A-PBX1+ B-ALL overexpressed FLT3. In contrast, mainly MLL-AF4+ B-ALL but also ETV6-RUNX1+, BCR-ABL+ or B-ALL displaying normal cytogenetics exhibited significantly higher FLT3 expression levels than normal bone marrow, supporting that aberrantly increased transcription of FLT3, rather than activating FLT3 mutations, contributes to the pathogenesis of these B-ALL. Using the median FLT3 expression as cut-off value we found that high-level FLT3 expression is associated with an extremely poor 1-year overall survival (OS; 0 vs 71%; P=0.002) and disease-free survival (DFS; 0 vs 43%; P=0.03) in MLL-AF4+ B-ALL but not in MLL-germline B-ALL. Cox regression analysis with OS/DFS as end points showed that age>14 years and high-level FLT3 expression were independent prognostic factors when all ALL patients were analyzed together. Importantly, when the MLL-AF4+ B-ALL subgroup was analyzed separately, high-level FLT3 expression was the only independent prognostic factor for OS and treatment outcome. These findings indicate that high FLT3 expression identifies MLL-AF4+ ALL patients at very high risk of treatment failure and poor survival, emphasizing the value of ongoing/future clinical trials for FLT3 inhibitors.","['Chillon, M C', 'Gomez-Casares, M T', 'Lopez-Jorge, C E', 'Rodriguez-Medina, C', 'Molines, A', 'Sarasquete, M E', 'Alcoceba, M', 'Miguel, J D G-S', 'Bueno, C', 'Montes, R', 'Ramos, F', 'Rodriguez, J N', 'Giraldo, P', 'Ramirez, M', 'Garcia-Delgado, R', 'Fuster, J L', 'Gonzalez-Diaz, M', 'Menendez, P']","['Chillon MC', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Lopez-Jorge CE', 'Rodriguez-Medina C', 'Molines A', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Alcoceba M', 'Miguel JD', 'Bueno C', 'Montes R', 'Ramos F', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Giraldo P', 'Ramirez M', 'Garcia-Delgado R', 'Fuster JL', 'Gonzalez-Diaz M', 'Menendez P']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca and Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. chillon@usal.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012161 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2360-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.161.

An update with median follow-up times of 17.1, 8.7 and 5.5 years, respectively, is provided. Conditional overall survival (OS) analysis from a 4-year landmark was applied to account for earlier protocol failure owing to disease aggressiveness and toxicities. Cumulative relative survival was computed in the context of age- and gender-matched US population, and interval-specific relative survival ratios were estimated to determine times to normal survival expectation. Based on Cox model-adjusted statistics, OS, progression-free survival and complete-response duration all improved with the transitions from TT1 to TT2 to TT3; improvement was also evident from time-to-progression estimates, 4-year conditional survival data and cumulative relative survival. Interval-specific relative survival normalized progressively sooner, reaching near-normal levels with TT3 in patients who attained complete response. Thus, a strategy using all myeloma-effective agents up-front seems effective at preventing, in progressively larger patient cohorts over time, the outgrowth of resistant tumor cells that account for ongoing relapses.","['Usmani, S Z', 'Crowley, J', 'Hoering, A', 'Mitchell, A', 'Waheed, S', 'Nair, B', 'AlSayed, Y', 'Vanrhee, F', 'Barlogie, B']","['Usmani SZ', 'Crowley J', 'Hoering A', 'Mitchell A', 'Waheed S', 'Nair B', 'AlSayed Y', 'Vanrhee F', 'Barlogie B']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. susmani@uams.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA055819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55813/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120618,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3744094,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012160 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.160 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):226-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.160.

HSC development must be tightly controlled from cell fate determination to self-maintenance during adulthood. This involves a panel of important developmental signaling pathways and other factors which act synergistically within the HSC population and/or in the HSC niche. Genetically conserved processes of HSC development plus many other developmental advantages make the zebrafish an ideal model organism to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying HSC programming. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes recent progress on zebrafish HSCs with particular focus on how developmental signaling controls hemogenic endothelium-derived HSC development. We also describe the interaction of different signaling pathways during these processes. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The hematopoietic stem cell system is a paradigm for stem cell studies. Use of the zebrafish model to study signaling regulation of HSCs in vivo has resulted in a great deal of information concerning HSC biology in vertebrates. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These new findings facilitate a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of HSC programming, and will provide possible new strategies for the treatment of HSC-related hematological diseases, such as leukemia.

For investigating Bcl-x(S) efficacy and pathways, an adenoviral vector was constructed with its cDNA under tetracycline-off control. Bcl-x(S) overexpression resulted in efficient apoptosis induction and caspase activation in melanoma cells. Indicative of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways, Bcl-x(S) translocated to the mitochondria, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases. In melanoma cells, Bcl-x(S) resulted in significant Bak activation, and Bak knockdown as well as Bcl-x(L) overexpression abrogated Bcl-x(S)-induced apoptosis, whereas Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) knockdown resulted in a sensitization. With regard to the particular role of voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) for inhibition of Bak, we identified here a notable interaction between Bcl-x(S) and VDAC2 in melanoma cells, which was proven in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation analyses. On the other hand, Bcl-x(S) showed no direct interaction with Bak, and its binding to VDAC2 appeared as also independent of Bak expression. Suggesting a new proapoptotic mechanism, Bcl-x(S) overexpression resulted in disruption of the VDAC2-Bak interaction leading to release of Bak. Further supporting this pathway, overexpression of VDAC2 strongly decreased apoptosis by Bcl-x(S). New proapoptotic pathways are of principle interest for overcoming apoptosis deficiency of melanoma cells.","['Plotz, M', 'Gillissen, B', 'Hossini, A M', 'Daniel, P T', 'Eberle, J']","['Plotz M', 'Gillissen B', 'Hossini AM', 'Daniel PT', 'Eberle J']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Skin Cancer Center Charite, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC3504705,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/04/18 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201271 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.71 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Dec;19(12):1928-38. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.71.

A modified Dillman approach was utilized to encourage survey response. From 1200 surveyed, a total of 113 physicians responded. In all, 68% were male, 62% identified as White/non-Hispanic, 79% practiced in non-academic settings and 80% reported spending 75-100% of their professional effort in clinical care. Using clinical vignettes, we detected significantly increased odds for HCT non-referral according to age (age 60 vs 30, odds ratio (OR) 8.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9-11.7, P<0.0001), insurance coverage (no coverage vs coverage, OR 6.9, 95% CI: 5.2-9.1, P<0.0001) and race (African-American vs Caucasian, OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.9-2.9, P<0.0001).

These data speak to important factors relevant to HCT referral practices, and highlight several opportunities for education and intervention to reduce current disparities.","['Pidala, J', 'Craig, B M', 'Lee, S J', 'Majhail, N', 'Quinn, G', 'Anasetti, C']","['Pidala J', 'Craig BM', 'Lee SJ', 'Majhail N', 'Quinn G', 'Anasetti C']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. joseph.pidala@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['P20 MD003375/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 MD003375-02/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120618,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC3549547,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201295 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.95 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jan;48(1):63-7. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.95.

We retrospectively analyzed 605 patients with intermediate-risk AML, who received myeloablative allo-HCT in CR1. The 4-year OS for MSD (n=290) and matched unrelated donor (MUD; n=141) was 65% and 68% (P=0.50), respectively. In multivariate analysis, MUD had a similar risk of overall mortality as MSD (hazard ratio=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.30; P=0.58), whereas older age, female donor/male recipient (FDMR) combination, and requiring more than one course of induction chemotherapy to achieve CR1 were poor prognostic factors for OS. Thus, OS after MUD HCT with sex combinations other than FDMR was significantly higher than that after MSD HCT from female donors to male recipients (4-year OS 72% versus 55%, P=0.04). These results suggest that HCT, not only from MSD, but also from MUD, should be considered in younger patients with intermediate-risk AML in CR1, and that the donor-recipient sex combination is more important than the donor type in donor selection.","['Imahashi, N', 'Suzuki, R', 'Fukuda, T', 'Kakihana, K', 'Kanamori, H', 'Eto, T', 'Mori, T', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Iwato, K', 'Sakura, T', 'Ikegame, K', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Kondo, T', 'Iida, H', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Tanaka, J', 'Kawa, K', 'Morishima, Y', 'Atsuta, Y', 'Miyamura, K']","['Imahashi N', 'Suzuki R', 'Fukuda T', 'Kakihana K', 'Kanamori H', 'Eto T', 'Mori T', 'Kobayashi N', 'Iwato K', 'Sakura T', 'Ikegame K', 'Kurokawa M', 'Kondo T', 'Iida H', 'Sakamaki H', 'Tanaka J', 'Kawa K', 'Morishima Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Miyamura K']","['Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. nimahashi@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201284 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.84 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jan;48(1):56-62. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.84.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted an analysis of the clinical and radiographic features, etiologies, treatments, and outcomes of patients with SDHs and cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with a diagnosis of SDH and cancer from January 2000 to December 2007. We analyzed clinical and radiographic data; multivariate Cox regression was performed to associate tumor type and etiology with survival outcome. RESULTS: There were 90 patients; 66 had acute or subacute SDHs, 9 chronic SDHs, 11 subdural hygromas, and 4 SDHs of unclear chronicity. Gliomas (16%), leukemias (14%), and prostate cancers (14%) were the most frequent malignancies. The most common single etiologies were coagulopathy (27%) and trauma (11%). SDHs with multiple etiologies occurred in 25 patients (28%) with the combination of coagulopathy and trauma occurring in 15. Sixty patients (67%) were either completely or partially independent after SDH, and 1-year survival was 43% (95% confidence interval: 32.1-52.9). Overall survival correlated with etiology (P < .0001) and whether the malignancy was in remission (P = .005). Trauma was associated with the best overall survival compared with coagulopathy. CONCLUSION: Leukemia and prostate cancer are the most common systemic cancers associated with SDH, and gliomas may predispose to SDH more often than previously recognized. Coagulopathy is common and associated with the worst outcome, but many patients experience good functional outcome and survival.","['Reichman, Jordan', 'Singer, Samuel', 'Navi, Babak', 'Reiner, Anne', 'Panageas, Kathy', 'Gutin, Philip H', 'Deangelis, Lisa M']","['Reichman J', 'Singer S', 'Navi B', 'Reiner A', 'Panageas K', 'Gutin PH', 'Deangelis LM']","['Department of Neurology, Swedish Edmonds Hospital, Edmonds, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182517938 [doi]', '00006123-201207000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurosurgery. 2012 Jul;71(1):74-9. doi: 10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182517938.,20121030,10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182517938 [doi],,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Hematoma, Subdural/*diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*complications', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,['Neurosurgery. 2012 Jul;71(1):79.

Piceatannol treatment reduced TNFalpha shedding and NFkappaB activation and decreased the release of soluble TNFalpha into the culture medium of U937 cells. Moreover, ADAM17 expression was down-regulated in piceatannol-treated cells. Over-expression of ADAM17 abrogated the ability of piceatannol to suppress TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB activation. Piceatannol-evoked beta-TrCP up-regulation promoted Sp1 degradation, thus reducing transcriptional level of ADAM17 gene in U937 cells. Piceatannol treatment induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation but inactivation of Akt and ERK. In contrast to p38 MAPK inhibitor or restoration of ERK activation, transfection of constitutive active Akt abolished the effect of piceatannol on beta-TrCP, Sp1 and ADAM17 expression. Piceatannol-elicited down-regulation of miR-183 expression was found to cause beta-TrCP up-regulation. Inactivation of Akt resulted in Foxp3 down-regulation and reduced miR-183 expression in piceatannol-treated cells. Knock-down of Foxp3 and chromatin immunoprecipitating revealed that Foxp3 genetically regulated transcription of miR-183 gene. Taken together, our data indicate that suppression of Akt/Foxp3-mediated miR-183 expression blocks Sp1-mediated ADAM17 expression in piceatannol-treated U937 cells. Consequently, piceatannol suppresses TNFalpha shedding, leading to inhibition of TNFalpha/NFkappaB pathway.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00405-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Sep 1;84(5):670-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.06.007.

We demonstrate that trogocytosis is more common in multiple myeloma (MM) than chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia; that T cells are more probable to be recipients than B or natural killer cells; that trogocytosis occurs independently of either the T-cell receptor or HLA compatibility; and that after trogocytosis, T cells with acquired antigens can become novel regulators of T-cell proliferation. We screened 168 patients with MM and found that CD86 and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) were antigens commonly acquired by T cells from malignant plasma cells. CD3+ CD86acq+ and CD3+ HLA-Gacq+ cells were more prevalent in bone marrow than peripheral blood samples. The presence of either CD86 or HLA-G on malignant plasma cells was associated with a poor prognosis.

To evaluate the relevance of anti-HLA antibodies, we have retrospectively analyzed 107 peripheral blood allo-HSCTs after reduced-intensity conditioning regimen between 2005 and 2010. Acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma were the most frequent malignancies in the cohort. The detection of anti-HLA antibodies was systematically performed in all patients before transplantation. Anti-HLA antibodies were present in 24 patients (22%). There was no significant impact of anti-HLA antibodies on engraftment, incidence of relapse, and incidence of acute graft-vs-host disease. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies was associated with significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.006) and event-free survival (p = 0.024) after stratification on sex. The 3-year probability of overall survival was 34% without anti-HLA antibodies and 16% in their presence. Patients with anti-HLA antibodies had a higher transplant-related mortality associated with life-threatening vascular complications.

The progression of CML is associated with genomic instability. Systematic analysis of DNA damage signalling in the presence of BCR/ABL thus offers opportunities to identify mechanisms of leukaemic progression. We therefore undertook a quantitative phosphoproteomics study to test whether BCR/ABL expression could globally affect the response to genotoxic stress signalling. Etoposide-induced DNA damage was chosen and the concentration and time of exposure determined such that apoptosis was not associated with the study. More than 1100 phosphoentities were identified. BCR/ABL was shown to significantly alter the response to etoposide in many cases. These include sites on MDC1, a key component of DNA repair, and Hemogen. Hemogen is a transcriptional target of HOXB4 and GATA1, two transcription factors involved in haemopoietic development, and is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukaemia. To validate Hemogen phosphorylation, absolute quantification using an isotopomeric standard and selected reaction monitoring was performed.

In our previous work, ANP32B was identified as a novel direct substrate for caspase-3 and acted as a negative regulator for leukemic cell apoptosis. In this work, we provided the first demonstration that ANP32B expression was down-regulated during differentiation induction of leukemic cells by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Knockdown of ANP32B expression by specific shRNA enhanced ATRA-induced leukemic cell differentiation, while ectopic expression of ANP32B attenuated it, indicating an inhibitory role of ANP32B against leukemic cell differentiation. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay revealed that ANP32B might exert this role through inhibiting the ATRA dependent transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha). These data will shed new insights into understanding the biological functions of ANP32B protein.","['Yu, Yun', 'Shen, Shao-Ming', 'Zhang, Fei-Fei', 'Wu, Zhao-Xia', 'Han, Bin', 'Wang, Li-Shun']","['Yu Y', 'Shen SM', 'Zhang FF', 'Wu ZX', 'Han B', 'Wang LS']","['Shanghai Universities E-Institute for Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01113-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jul 13;423(4):721-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.025.

Whereas erythropoietin treatment showed an improvement in the patients' condition, it revealed increased risks of thromboembolic and cardiovascular events. Herein we describe stimulation of erythropoiesis by the multifunctional 1-(butyryloxy)ethyl-5-amino-4-oxopentanoate, (AlaAcBu), a 5-aminolevulinic-acid (ALA) derivative, which undergoes metabolic hydrolysis yielding two erythroid differentiation inducers, ALA and butyric acid (BA), each acting through a different mechanism. ALA, the first precursor in the heme biosynthesis, accelerates heme synthesis and BA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) that activates the transcription of globin mRNA. Our results show that the AlaAcBu mutual prodrug is a potent chemical differentiation inducer of K562 human erythroleukemia cells manifested by augmentation of heme and globin synthesis and assembly of hemoglobin. Exposure of K-562 cells to AlaAcBu resulted in an increase in heme synthesis and globin expression. Stimulation of the heme pathway was evident by the over-expression of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) and ferrochelatase. AlaAcBu promoted cellular erythroid differentiation depicted by the expression of the marker glycophorin A and cellular maturation characterized by cytoplasm hemoglobinization, polar arrangement of mitochondria and a developed central vacuolar system preceding nuclear extrusion. The ability of AlaAcBu to promote differentiation along the erythroid lineage and to dramatically induce hemoglobin synthesis presented in this report.","['Berkovitch-Luria, G', 'Yakobovitch, S', 'Weitman, M', 'Nudelman, A', 'Rozic, G', 'Rephaeli, A', 'Malik, Z']","['Berkovitch-Luria G', 'Yakobovitch S', 'Weitman M', 'Nudelman A', 'Rozic G', 'Rephaeli A', 'Malik Z']","['The Mina and Everard Goodman Life Sciences Faculty, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan 52900, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120613,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(12)00244-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2012.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2012 Aug 30;47(1):206-14. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2012.05.017.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to both consultants and superintendent radiographers in the 21 centres within the CCLG network that perform MRI on paediatric brain tumour patients. Information was requested as to whether the centre had a protocol for imaging paediatric brain tumours, which sequences were performed, and whether these were used by all consultants. RESULTS: Twenty-seven completed questionnaires out of the 42 sent were returned, which included responses from 17 of the 21 UK centres. The majority of centres had a protocol for MRI of paediatric brain tumours at all stages of treatment. The standardized CCLG MRI sequences were incorporated in full at only five of the 17 centres. CONCLUSION: The standard sequences of the CCLG brain imaging protocol are poorly adhered to nationally. Further awareness of the revised protocol is needed, with improved access to the guidelines for non-CCLG members on the CCLG and Royal college of Radiologists website.","['Craig, E', 'Connolly, D J A', 'Griffiths, P D', 'Raghavan, A', 'Lee, V', 'Batty, R']","['Craig E', 'Connolly DJ', 'Griffiths PD', 'Raghavan A', 'Lee V', 'Batty R']","[""Department of Radiology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120615,England,Clin Radiol,Clinical radiology,1306016,,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/24 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9260(12)00164-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.crad.2012.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Radiol. 2012 Sep;67(9):829-32. doi: 10.1016/j.crad.2012.03.018.

Hypermethylation of CpG islands within promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is associated with transcriptional inactivation and represents, in addition to genetic aberrations, an important mechanism of gene silencing in the pathogenesis of human cancer. Inter-alpha-trypsine inhibitors (ITIs) are a family of serine protease inhibitors consisting of one light chain (bikunin) and two heavy chains (ITI heavy chains, ITIHs). ITIHs stabilize the extracellular matrix (ECM) by interacting with hyaluronic acid, which is a major ECM component. Hypermethylation in the upstream region of the promoter-associated CpG island of ITIH5, the most recently described member of the ITIH family, has been previously detected in breast cancer and was associated with an adverse outcome. In this study, we determined the DNA methylation status of the promoter region near the transcription start site of the ITIH5 tumor suppressor gene in leukemia cell lines and primary samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as the potential use of demethylating agents to restore a demethylated state of the promoter. Aberrant ITIH5 promoter hypermethylation occurred in 15 of 104 (14.4%) diagnostic AML samples. There were no statistically significant correlations between the ITIH5 methylation status and clinical prognostic parameters. Our results indicate that aberrant ITIH5 promoter hypermethylation is a novel epigenetic event in AML.","['Oing, Christoph', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Dahl, Edgar', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Galm, Oliver']","['Oing C', 'Jost E', 'Dahl E', 'Wilop S', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Galm O']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110623,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,PMC3365397,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/06/19 06:01,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13148-011-0043-5 [doi]', '43 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2011 Aug;2(2):419-23. doi: 10.1007/s13148-011-0043-5.

Response rate is about 50% and response duration is limited. Histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitors are attractive partners for epigenetic combination therapy. We treated 24 patients with AZA (100 mg/m(2), 5 days) plus valproate (VPA; continuous dosing, trough serum level 80-110 mug/ml). According to WHO classification, 5 patients had MDS, 2 had MDS/MPD, and 17 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Seven patients (29%) had previously received intensive chemotherapy, and five had previous HDAC inhibitor treatment. The overall response rate was 37% in the entire cohort but significantly higher (57%) in previously untreated patients, especially those with MDS (64%). Seven (29%) patients achieved CR (29%) and two PR (8%), respectively. Hematological CR was accompanied by complete cytogenetic remission according to conventional cytogenetics in all evaluable cases. Some patients also showed complete remission according to FISH on bone marrow mononuclear cells and CD34(+) peripheral blood cells, as well as by follow-up of somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations. Four additional patients achieved at least marrow remissions. Factors influencing response were AML (vs. MDS), marrow blast count, pretreatment, transfusion dependency, concomitant medication with hydroxyurea, and valproic acid (VPA) serum level.

Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia, where a single disease-initiating genetic event has been identified, a more complicated series of genetic mutations appear to be responsible for the BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs which include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. Recent studies have revealed a number of epigenetic alterations that also likely contribute to disease pathogenesis and determine clinical outcome. Increasing evidence indicates that alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA expression patterns can collectively influence gene expression and potentially contribute to MPN pathogenesis. Examples include mutations in genes encoding proteins that modify chromatin structure (EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1/2, JAK2V617F, and IKZF1) as well as epigenetic modification of genes critical for cell proliferation and survival (suppressors of cytokine signaling, polycythemia rubra vera-1, CXC chemokine receptor 4, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)). These epigenetic lesions serve as novel targets for experimental therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials are currently underway evaluating HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors for the treatment of patients with MPNs.","['Mascarenhas, John', 'Roper, Nitin', 'Chaurasia, Pratima', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Mascarenhas J', 'Roper N', 'Chaurasia P', 'Hoffman R']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110709,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,PMC3365400,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/06/19 06:01,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13148-011-0050-6 [doi]', '50 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2011 Aug;2(2):197-212. doi: 10.1007/s13148-011-0050-6.

Male adolescents with cancer are particularly encouraged to bank semen to preserve fertility before beginning chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We evaluated the feasibility of semen preservation in 12 to 17-year-old patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from the sperm banking database at our institution for the years 1995 to 2009. Outcomes measured were histological diagnosis, success rate, sperm concentration and sample volume. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients with a mean age of 16.1 years (range 13.2 to 17.9) were referred for cryopreservation during the study period. Underlying diagnoses included lymphoma (64 patients), leukemia (50), bone tumors (18), testicular tumors (13), soft tissue sarcoma (13), brain tumor (6), germ cell tumors (6) and other cancers (10). Of the patients 119 (66%) successfully banked sperm. A total of 26 patients did not attend their appointment. Of those who attended 15 (10%) were unable to provide a sample and 20 (13%) had azoospermia. A total of 20 patients died after banking sperm and their specimens were subsequently destroyed. CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreservation of semen of acceptable quality for future use in assisted conception is feasible for most adolescents from age 13 years onward.","['Keene, David J B', 'Sajjad, Yasmin', 'Makin, Guy', 'Cervellione, R M']","['Keene DJ', 'Sajjad Y', 'Makin G', 'Cervellione RM']","[""Department of Pediatric Urology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom. dkeene@nhs.net""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120615,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5347(12)03456-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2012.04.023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2012 Aug;188(2):594-7. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2012.04.023.

Recent findings suggest that uncontrolled self-renewal may explain cancer relapses and may represent a critical target for cancer prevention. It is conceivable that the loss of regulatory molecules resulting from inappropriate consumption of specific foods and their constituents may foster the aberrant self-renewal of cancer stem cells. In fact, increasing evidence points to the network delivering signals for self-renewal from extracellular compartments to the nucleus including changes in stem cell environments, inducible expression of microRNAs, hyperplastic nuclear chromatin structures, and the on/off of differentiation process as possible sites of action for bioactive food components. Diverse dietary constituents such as vitamins A and D, genistein, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), sulforaphane, curcumin, piperine, theanine and choline have been shown to modify self-renewal properties of cancer stem cells. The ability of these bioactive food components to influence the balance between proliferative and quiescent cells by regulating critical feedback molecules in the network including dickkopf 1 (DKK-1), secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2), B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) may account for their biological response. Overall, the response to food components does not appear to be tissue or organ specific, suggesting there may be common cellular mechanisms. Unquestionably, additional studies are needed to clarify the physiological role of these dietary components in preventing the resistance of tumor cells to traditional drugs and cancer recurrence.","['Kim, Young S', 'Farrar, William', 'Colburn, Nancy H', 'Milner, John A']","['Kim YS', 'Farrar W', 'Colburn NH', 'Milner JA']","['Nutritional Science Research Group, Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. yk47s@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Nutr Biochem,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,9010081,PMC4518442,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/11/03 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0955-2863(12)00051-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr Biochem. 2012 Jul;23(7):691-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.03.002.,20121102,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.03.002 [doi],,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (DKK1 protein, human)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '8021PR16QO (theanine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'U71XL721QK (piperine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Benzodioxoles/pharmacology', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Choline/pharmacology', 'Curcumin/chemistry', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Diet', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Vitamin A/pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",['NIHMS381701'],['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of antitumoral effects of its inhibitors, however, remains poorly characterized. Moreover, the effects of their combination with the pro-apoptotic pharmacologic inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, ABT-737, have never been evaluated. In this study, we thus specifically addressed the biologic consequences of targeting gamma-secretase and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, alone or simultaneously, in breast cancer cell lines as well as in a novel human breast cancer ex vivo assay. METHODS: By using in vitro 2D or 3D cultures of breast cancer cells plus a novel preclinical short-term ex vivo assay that correctly maintains human mammary tissue integrity and preserves tumor microenvironment, we tested the effects of the pharmacologic gamma-secretase inhibitor GSIXII used as a single agent or in combination with ABT-737. RESULTS: We show herein that the gamma-secretase inhibitor, GSIXII, efficiently induces apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines by a process that relies on the induction of Noxa, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2-homology 3 domain (BH3)-only protein of the Bcl-2 family that functions as an inhibitor of antiapoptotic Mcl1. GSIXII also targets mammary cancer stem-like cells because it dramatically prevents in vitro mammosphere formation. Moreover, combining GSIXII treatment with ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic inhibitor of additional antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, leads to both a synergistic apoptotic response in breast cancer cells and to an inhibitory effect on mammosphere formation. These effects are also found when a Notch transcriptional inhibitor, SAHM1, is used. Finally, we evaluated individual human tumor responses to gamma-secretase inhibition alone or in combination with ABT-737 in ex vivo assays. Analysis of a series of 30 consecutive tumors indicated that a majority of tumors are sensitive to apoptosis induction by GSIXII and that association of GSIXII with ABT-737 leads to an enhanced induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: We thus provide evidence that gamma-secretase, and downstream Notch signaling, are relevant targets in breast cancer. GSIXII, used as single agent or in combination with clinically relevant BH3-mimetics, is a promising innovative proapoptotic strategy to treat mammary tumors.","['Seveno, Celine', 'Loussouarn, Delphine', 'Brechet, Sophie', 'Campone, Mario', 'Juin, Philippe', 'Barille-Nion, Sophie']","['Seveno C', 'Loussouarn D', 'Brechet S', 'Campone M', 'Juin P', 'Barille-Nion S']","['Team 8 ""Cell survival and tumor escape in breast cancer,"" UMR 892 INSERM/6299 CNRS/Universite de Nantes, Institut de Recherche Therapeutique de l\'Universite de Nantes, 8, quai Moncousu, BP 70721, 44007 Nantes Cedex 1, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120615,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,PMC3446359,2012/06/19 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr3214 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr3214 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 15;14(3):R96. doi: 10.1186/bcr3214.,20130311,,,,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-leucinal)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a multiple-treatment meta-analysis using direct and indirect data based on all available head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the benefits and harms of first-line treatments for untreated advanced-stage CLL. Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing overall survival and progression-free survival between two or more first-line treatments. Twenty-five trials involving 7926 patients were included. Of the 25 eligible RCTs, 30 (n=7741 patients) and 12 (n=3910 patients) treatment pairs were included in the multiple-treatment meta-analysis of overall and progression-free survival, respectively. Trials generally enrolled younger and less complicated patients than actual clinical practice. There was no evidence for inconsistency between direct and indirect data. Based on combined direct and indirect data, no single treatment showed significantly better overall survival than any other, and credible intervals were wide. Among six newer treatments with longer progression-free survival compared with chlorambucil, fludarabine-rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (HR=0.24, 95% CrI: 0.13-0.51) and bendamustine (HR=0.23, 95% CrI: 0.13-0.42) had the largest PFS benefit. Limited data on treatment-related mortality precluded multiple-treatment meta-analysis. In conclusion, published randomized evidence on overall survival is insufficient to recommend any particular first-line treatments.

Patients received 2000 mg/m(2) per d continuously i.v. during days 1-5 every 3 weeks. Patients were matched by six risk factors with historical controls; remission rate (assessed after 1 or 2 cycles) and 6-month survival were compared. Sixty-one patients, median age 58 years, were enrolled; 52% had five or six risk factors. The remission rate was 18% (95% confidence interval: 9-30%) vs. 4% in controls (P < 0.0001), 6-month survival rate was 43%, median overall survival was 5.3 months (vs. 1.5 months); 10 patients (16%) were referred for stem cell transplantation after treatment.

Despite the overall structural similarity of their interaction with helical BH3 domains, Bcl-2-like proteins exhibit an intricate spectrum of binding specificities whose underlying basis is not well understood. Here, we characterize these interactions using Rosetta FlexPepBind, a protocol for the prediction of peptide binding specificity that evaluates the binding potential of different peptides based on structural models of the corresponding peptide-receptor complexes. For two prominent players, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, we obtain good agreement with a large set of experimental SPOT array measurements and recapitulate the binding specificity of peptides derived by yeast display in a previous study. We extend our approach to a third member of this family, Bcl-2: we test our blind prediction of the binding of 180 BIM-derived peptides with a corresponding experimental SPOT array. Both prediction and experiment reveal a Bcl-2 binding specificity pattern that resembles that of Bcl-xL. Finally, we extend this application to accurately predict the specificity pattern of additional human BH3-only derived peptides. This study characterizes the distinct patterns of binding specificity of BH3-only derived peptides for the Bcl-2 like proteins Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 and provides insight into the structural basis of determinants of specificity.","['London, Nir', 'Gulla, Stefano', 'Keating, Amy E', 'Schueler-Furman, Ora']","['London N', 'Gulla S', 'Keating AE', 'Schueler-Furman O']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hadassah Medical School, The Hebrew University, POB 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM084181/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM84181/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120712,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,PMC3711574,2012/06/19 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/06/19 06:00'],"['2012/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi3003567 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2012 Jul 24;51(29):5841-50. doi: 10.1021/bi3003567.

Upon failure, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDT/ASCT) is performed, but its effectiveness has not been verified in this setting. We analyzed all Swiss cases of chemosensitive HL autografted after failure of BEACOPP escalated (n = 22) and compared outcomes with 22 cases of HDT/ASCT following frontline ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) failure. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 76% for ABVD and 42% for BEACOPP escalated (p = 0.029). Two- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 90% and 71% for ABVD and 72% and 65% for BEACOPP escalated, respectively (p = not significant). Three patients in the ABVD and four in the BEACOPP escalated groups underwent allotransplant for relapse after HDT/ASCT. Grade 3-4 toxicities were comparable in both groups. Three cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) were recorded in the BEACOPP escalated group.

This retrospective multicenter report assessed the outcome of 90 patients who received a CLO-containing conditioning regimen before allo-SCT for AML (n = 69) or ALL (n = 21). Median age was 42 yr at transplant. The majority of cases (n = 66) presented with an active disease at transplant while 38 patients had received previous transplantation(s). A total of 88 and two patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning or a myeloablative regimen, respectively. Engraftment was achieved in 97% of evaluable patients. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-45), the 2-year OS, LFS, relapse, and NRM rates were 28 +/- 5%, 23 +/- 5%, 41 +/- 6%, and 35 +/- 5%, respectively. When comparing AML and ALL patients, OS and LFS were significantly higher for AML (OS, 35 +/- 6% vs. 0%, P < 0.0001); LFS: 30 +/- 6% vs. 0%, P < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariate analysis, an AML diagnosis was the only factor associated with a better LFS (HR = 0.37; 95%CI, 0.21-0.66; P = 0.001). We conclude that a CLO-containing conditioning regimen prior to allo-SCT might be an effective treatment.

A multifactorial approach was developed to rationally evaluate the singular and interactive control of MEK/ERK pathway, GSK-3 inhibition, and LIF/STAT3 signaling at physiological and non-physiological oxygen tensions. Collectively, our methodology revealed a significant role of GSK-3-mediated signaling towards maintenance of mES cell pluripotency at lower O(2) tensions.

As with the human disease, mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation with BCR-FGFR1 leads to CML-like myeloproliferation as well as B-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The murine disease described in this report is virtually identical to the human disease in that both showed bi-lineage involvement of myeloid and B-cells, splenomegaly, leukocytosis and bone marrow hypercellularity. A CD19(+) IgM(-) CD43(+) immunophenotype was seen both in primary tumors and two cell lines derived from these tumors. In all primary tumors, subpopulations of these CD19(+) IgM(-) CD43(+) were also either B220(+) or B220(-), suggesting a block in differentiation at the pro-B cell stage. The B220(-) phenotype was retained in one of the cell lines while the other was B220(+). When the two cell lines were transplanted into syngeneic mice, all animals developed the same B-lymphoblastic leukemia within 2-weeks.

Global profiles of gene expression in K562 cells exposed to sodium valproate were assessed and validated. The differentially expressed genes identified were further used to query the connectivity map database to retrieve a ranked list of compounds that act on the same intracellular targets as sodium valproate. A significant increase in cell apoptosis and a change in gene expression profile were observed in valproate-exposed K562 cells. The significant enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms for the differentially expressed genes showed that these genes were involved in many important biological processes. Eight differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. The connectivity map analysis showed gene expression profile in K562 cells exposed to sodium valproate was most similar to that of HDACi and PI3K inhibitors, suggesting that sodium valproate might exert antileukaemic action by inhibiting HDAC as well as inhibiting PI3K pathway. In conclusion, our data might provide clues to elucidate the molecular and therapeutic potential of VPA in leukaemia treatment, and the connectivity map is a useful tool for exploring the molecular mechanism of drug action.","['Zhang, Xiang-Zhong', 'Yin, Ai-Hua', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Zhu, Xiao-Yu', 'Ding, Qian', 'Wang, Chun-Huai', 'Chen, Yun-Xian']","['Zhang XZ', 'Yin AH', 'Lin DJ', 'Zhu XY', 'Ding Q', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YX']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong 510630, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,PMC3373151,2012/06/16 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/654291 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:654291. doi: 10.1155/2012/654291.

Though considered to be a relatively safe drug, use of ATRA can lead to several side effects such as retinoic acid syndrome and pseudotumor cerebri (PC). PC is a rare disorder characterized by neurologic and ocular signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, but with normal cerebrospinal fluid composition and normal brain imaging. Most of the previous studies suggest that PC, as a complication of ATRA therapy, occurs predominantly in the pediatric age group. Herein, we report a rare case of ATRA-induced PC in a 38-year-old woman undergoing induction treatment for APL. Symptoms improved with discontinuation of ATRA and treatment with acetazolamide. Concomitant administration of medications such as triazole antifungals which influence the cytochrome P-450 system can exacerbate this potential complication of ATRA. In this paper, we also review the current literature, provide a descriptive analysis of clinical features, and discuss the principles of management of ATRA-induced PC.","['Holmes, Dylan', 'Vishnu, Prakash', 'Dorer, Russell K', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Holmes D', 'Vishnu P', 'Dorer RK', 'Aboulafia DM']","['Floyd & Delores Jones Cancer Institute, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20120603,United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,PMC3371673,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/06/16 06:01,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/313057 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2012;2012:313057. doi: 10.1155/2012/313057.

Previously, it has been reported that the Pim-1 3'-UTR plays important roles in the regulation of Pim-1 mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms explaining how Pim-1 mRNA stability is determined by its 3'-UTR are not well known. Here, we demonstrate that tristetraprolin (TTP) plays a critical role in the regulation of Pim-1 mRNA stability. Our results show that the level of Pim-1 expression is inversely correlated with TTP expression in human cancer cells. Pim-1 mRNA contains two AU-rich elements (ARE1 and ARE2) in the 3'-UTR. TTP bound to ARE2 and enhanced the decay of Pim-1 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased Pim-1 expression and p21 and p27 phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth. Overexpression of Pim-1 cDNA without the 3'-UTR attenuated the inhibitory effects of TTP on p21 phosphorylation and cell growth. In addition, inhibition of p21 by siRNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of TTP on cell growth. Our results suggest that TTP post-transcriptionally down-regulates Pim-1 expression and that the overexpression of TTP may contribute to tumor suppression in part by down-regulating Pim-1 expression.","['Kim, Hong Kyeung', 'Kim, Chae Won', 'Vo, Mai-Tram', 'Lee, Hyun Hee', 'Lee, Ji Young', 'Yoon, Nal Ae', 'Lee, Chae Yeong', 'Moon, Chang Hoon', 'Min, Young Joo', 'Park, Jeong Woo', 'Cho, Wha Ja']","['Kim HK', 'Kim CW', 'Vo MT', 'Lee HH', 'Lee JY', 'Yoon NA', 'Lee CY', 'Moon CH', 'Min YJ', 'Park JW', 'Cho WJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Ulsan, Ulsan 680-749, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3436505,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)68412-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.376483 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 17;287(34):28770-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.376483.

Although laser and UV irradiation have immunosuppressive effects on inflammatory diseases by suppressing mast cells, little is known about the effects of gamma-ionizing radiation on mast cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of gamma-ionizing radiation on RBL-2H3 cells, a convenient model system for studying regulated secretion by mast cells. Low-dose radiation (<0.1 gray (Gy)) did not induce cell death, but high-dose radiation (>0.5 Gy) induced apoptosis. Low-dose ionizing radiation significantly suppressed the release of mediators (histamine, beta-hexosaminidase, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. To determine the mechanism of mediator release inhibition by ionizing radiation, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, phospholipase Cgamma, PKCs, and MAPK, and intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)). The phosphorylation of signaling molecules following stimulation of high-affinity IgE receptor I (FcepsilonRI) was specifically inhibited by low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy). These results were due to the suppression of FcepsilonRI expression by the low-dose ionizing radiation. Therefore, low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy) may function as a novel inhibitor of mast cell activation.","['Joo, Hae Mi', 'Nam, Seon Young', 'Yang, Kwang Hee', 'Kim, Cha Soon', 'Jin, Young Woo', 'Kim, Ji Young']","['Joo HM', 'Nam SY', 'Yang KH', 'Kim CS', 'Jin YW', 'Kim JY']","['Radiation Effect Research Team, Radiation Health Research Institute, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., Ltd., Seoul 132-703, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3431648,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47801-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.378497 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 10;287(33):27789-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.378497.

Using a computational model, we identified a sequence of precisely timed drug additions that alter p53 pulses to instead produce a sustained p53 response. This leads to the expression of a different set of downstream genes and also alters cell fate: Cells that experience p53 pulses recover from DNA damage, whereas cells exposed to sustained p53 signaling frequently undergo senescence.

Only approximately 40% of younger and 10% of older adults are long-term survivors. Although curing the leukemia is always the most formidable challenge, complications from the disease itself and its treatment are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Such complications, discussed herein, include tumor lysis, hyperleukocytosis, cytarabine-induced cellebellar toxicity, acute promyelocytic leukemia differentiation syndrome, thrombohemorrhagic syndrome in acute promyelocytic leukemia, L-asparaginase-associated thrombosis, leukemic meningitis, neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis, and transfussion-associated GVHD. Whereas clinical trials form the backbone for the management of acute leukemia, emergent clinical situations, predictable or not, are common and do not readily lend themselves to clinical trial evaluation. Furthermore, practice guidelines are often lacking. Not only are prospective trials impractical because of the emergent nature of the issue at hand, but clinicians are often reluctant to randomize such patients. Extensive practical experience is crucial and, even if there is no consensus, management of such emergencies should be guided by an understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.","['Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Ganzel, Chezi', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Zuckerman T', 'Ganzel C', 'Tallman MS', 'Rowe JM']","['Rambam Health Care Campus and Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120613,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46427-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-424440 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Sep 6;120(10):1993-2002. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-424440.

Kurz var. Laxior (Dunn) Z. Wei on rat myocardial ischemia has been investigated. An in vitro cardiocyte apoptosis model and an in vivo myocardial ischemia model were used to elucidate the mechanism of 17-methoxyl-7-hydroxy-benzene-furanchalcone. In contrast to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 100 micromol/L), 17-methoxyl-7-hydroxy-benzene-furanchalcone in vitro (255 and 510 micromol/L) increased the quantity of total superoxide dismutase and the protein expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2, while it inhibited cardiocyte apoptosis, the release of malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and protein expression of nuclear factor kappa Bp65 and Bcl-2-associated X protein. Furthermore, pretreatment with MHBFC in vivo (10 and 20 mg/kg) decreased heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, average pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, the largest upstroke velocity of the left ventricular pressure (+ dp/dtmax), total antioxidative capability, myoglobin isoenzyme of creatine kinase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, while it increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase, ATPases, left ventricular diastolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, the largest descendent velocity of the left ventricular pressure (-dp/dtmax) and the interval from the beginning of left ventricular contraction to +dp/dtmax (t - dp/dtmax), all in a dose-dependent manner. Our present results suggest that 17-methoxyl-7-hydroxy-benzene-furanchalcone is an attractive antimyocardial ischemia agent mostly because of its negative heart rate and negative inotropic effects, the reduction in myocardial oxidative damage, and the modulating expression of genes associated with apoptosis, which improves diastolic function.","['Jian, Jie', 'Qing, Feizhang', 'Zhang, Shijun', 'Huang, Jianchun', 'Huang, Renbin']","['Jian J', 'Qing F', 'Zhang S', 'Huang J', 'Huang R']","['Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, P.

Leukemia-associated genetic alterations may provide novel prognostic factors to refine present relapse treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of 13 recurrent genetic alterations in 204 children treated uniformly for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. The most common alterations were deletions of CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, fusion of ETV6-RUNX1 and deletions and/or mutations of TP53. Multivariate analysis identified IKZF1 deletion and TP53 alteration as independent predictors of inferior outcome (P=0.002 and P=0.001). Next, we investigated how both alterations can improve the established risk stratification in relapsed ALL. Intermediate-risk relapse patients with low minimal residual disease are currently considered to have a good prognosis. In this group, deletion of IKZF1 and alteration of TP53 identify patients with significantly inferior outcome (P<0.001). In high-risk relapse patients, deletion of IKZF1 is strongly predictive of a second relapse after stem cell transplantation (P<0.001). We conclude that IKZF1 and TP53 represent relevant prognostic factors that should be considered in future risk assessment of children with relapsed ALL to indicate treatment intensification or intervention.","['Krentz, S', 'Hof, J', 'Mendioroz, A', 'Vaggopoulou, R', 'Dorge, P', 'Lottaz, C', 'Engelmann, J C', 'Groeneveld, T W L', 'Korner, G', 'Seeger, K', 'Hagemeier, C', 'Henze, G', 'Eckert, C', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, R']","['Krentz S', 'Hof J', 'Mendioroz A', 'Vaggopoulou R', 'Dorge P', 'Lottaz C', 'Engelmann JC', 'Groeneveld TW', 'Korner G', 'Seeger K', 'Hagemeier C', 'Henze G', 'Eckert C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/16 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Feb;27(2):295-304. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.155.

Novel immunoassays measuring serum concentrations of the Ig heavy chain/light chain (HLC) subsets IgGkappa, IgGlambda, IgAkappa and IgAlambda were compared with monoclonal protein ('M-spike') quantification by serum protein electrophoresis, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M), albumin, serum free light chain (FLC) and cytogenetic markers in relation to outcome in 339 MM patients. Abnormal IgGkappa/IgGlambda and IgAkappa/IgAlambda ratios present in the respective tumor isotypes at clinical presentation were predictive of shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; P=0.0002), predominantly due to the suppression of the uninvolved (polyclonal) Ig of the same isotype as the tumor (HR 1.8; P=0.002).

However, the optimal therapeutic strategy for this entity has not been established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for the management of AML with GS. We retrospectively analyzed 503 consecutive adult AML patients (median age, 44 years; range, 15-73 years) who received allo-HSCT. A total of 44 patients (8.7%) had GS before transplantation. Patients with GS achieved comparable survival to those without GS (5-year overall survival (OS), 47% vs 44%, respectively, P=0.621). In patients with GS, excellent outcomes were seen in those that underwent allo-HSCT while in complete remission, whereas nine out of ten patients with GS at the time of transplant experienced a relapse within 6 months after allo-HSCT. Local irradiation for GS prior to allo-HSCT and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease did not affect survival significantly. Multivariate analysis identified age, disease status and the use of myeloablative conditioning as independent prognostic factors for OS. These data suggest that better control of GS prior to allo-HSCT is crucial to improve the outcome of transplantation for those with GS.","['Shimizu, H', 'Saitoh, T', 'Tanaka, M', 'Mori, T', 'Sakura, T', 'Kawai, N', 'Kanda, Y', 'Nakaseko, C', 'Yano, S', 'Fujita, H', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Kanamori, H', 'Okamoto, S']","['Shimizu H', 'Saitoh T', 'Tanaka M', 'Mori T', 'Sakura T', 'Kawai N', 'Kanda Y', 'Nakaseko C', 'Yano S', 'Fujita H', 'Fujisawa S', 'Miyawaki S', 'Kanamori H', 'Okamoto S']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine Maebashi, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/16 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2469-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.156.

However, the potential side effects of a LSD1-inhibitory therapy remain elusive. Here, we show, with a newly established conditional in vivo knockdown model, that LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy.","['Sprussel, A', 'Schulte, J H', 'Weber, S', 'Necke, M', 'Handschke, K', 'Thor, T', 'Pajtler, K W', 'Schramm, A', 'Konig, K', 'Diehl, L', 'Mestdagh, P', 'Vandesompele, J', 'Speleman, F', 'Jastrow, H', 'Heukamp, L C', 'Schule, R', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Buettner, R', 'Eggert, A', 'Gothert, J R']","['Sprussel A', 'Schulte JH', 'Weber S', 'Necke M', 'Handschke K', 'Thor T', 'Pajtler KW', 'Schramm A', 'Konig K', 'Diehl L', 'Mestdagh P', 'Vandesompele J', 'Speleman F', 'Jastrow H', 'Heukamp LC', 'Schule R', 'Duhrsen U', 'Buettner R', 'Eggert A', 'Gothert JR']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012157 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.157 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2039-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.157.

Grade II acute GVHD had no net impact on OS, while grade III-IV acute GVHD was associated with a worse OS (HR=0.4, P<0.0.001) owing to high risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM; HR=5.2, P<0.0001). In time-dependent multivariate Cox analyses, limited chronic GVHD tended to be associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR=0.72; P=0.07) translating into a better OS (HR=1.8; P<0.001), while extensive chronic GVHD was associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR=0.65; P=0.02) but also with higher NRM (HR=3.5; P<0.001) and thus had no net impact on OS. In-vivo T-cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab was successful at preventing extensive chronic GVHD (P<0.001), but without improving OS for ATG and even with worsening OS for alemtuzumab (HR=0.65; P=0.001).

METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by the MTS assay. Cell cycle distribution, mitochondrial membrane potential and annexin V staining were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins. RESULTS: CuB inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced G 2 /M phase arrest as well as formation of tetraploid cells. Accompanied with these effects, the actin dynamics was disrupted, and cofilin, a key regulator of actin dynamics, was persistently activated (dephosphorylated). Although CuB induced around 10% cells undergoing apoptosis, most of the cells were alive after CuB treatment for 24 h. Induction of autophagy was also evident by accumulation of LC3-II. CuB-induced autophagy seemed to be a prosurvival response, since suppression of CuB-induced autophagy significantly increased the activation of caspase-3. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that CuB exhibited antitumor activity in Jurkat cells through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which was at least partly due to the disruption of actin dynamics.","['Zhu, Jun-Shan', 'Ouyang, Dong-Yun', 'Shi, Zhi-Jian', 'Xu, Li-Hui', 'Zhang, Yan-Ting', 'He, Xian-Hui']","['Zhu JS', 'Ouyang DY', 'Shi ZJ', 'Xu LH', 'Zhang YT', 'He XH']","['Department of Immunobiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Pharmacology,Pharmacology,0152016,,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['000338757 [pii]', '10.1159/000338757 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacology. 2012;89(5-6):348-6. doi: 10.1159/000338757.,20120925,10.1159/000338757 [doi],,,"['0 (Actin Depolymerizing Factors)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0115W5MABF (cucurbitacin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Actin Depolymerizing Factors/metabolism', 'Actins/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several mechanisms proposed for 'conditioning', such as endogenous mediators or cytoprotective proteins. In recent reports, microRNAs (miRNAs) were involved in controlling the expression of myocardial ischemia-related genes. Some studies have demonstrated that cardiac miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 were significantly increased by late IPC with an increase in their target proteins [endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)], but their expression levels in 'conditioning' strategies are currently unknown. METHODS: In the current study, Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of four groups [control group (CON group, n = 12), IPC group (n = 12), IPO group (n = 12) and RIPC group (n = 12)]. Cardiac function was digitalized and analyzed. The expression of miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of HSP70, programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was detected by Western blot. Cardiac infarct size and myocardial apoptosis were determined using the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, respectively. RESULTS: The results revealed that miRNA-1 (233 +/- 45%) and miRNA-21 (356 +/- 33%) expression was up-regulated in the IPC group, but the expression of miRNA-1 was down-regulated in the RIPC (61 +/- 16%) group and IPO group (61 +/- 13%). The expression of PDCD4 [IPC (74 +/- 11%), RIPC (81 +/- 16%), IPO (83 +/- 12%)], HSP70 [IPC (74 +/- 5%), RIPC (81 +/- 6%), IPO (67 +/- 11%)] and Bax [IPC (27 +/- 6%), RIPC (21 +/- 3%), IPO (27 +/- 4%)] was down-regulated in the conditioning groups compared with the CON group [PDCD4 (130 +/- 11%), HSP70 (121 +/- 11%) and Bax (63 +/- 8%)]. In the conditioning hearts, infarct size [IPC (31.7 +/- 4.1%), RIPC (29.6 +/- 6.19%) and IPO (32.8 +/- 4.71%)] and myocardial apoptosis [IPC (15.2 +/- 4.21%), RIPC (17.2 +/- 1.92%) and IPO (15.6 +/- 4.04%)] were significantly decreased compared with the CON group (infarct size: 51.77 +/- 4.3%, myocardial apoptosis: 32.8 +/- 3.96%).

METHODS: The differences in the gene expression profiles of bone marrow mononuclear cells between chronic phase and blastic crisis were examined using DNA microarray. PANTHER database, Genomatix database and Bibliosphere software were used to analyze and predict the critical genes or transcription factors during disease progression. Some of the genes or transcription factors were selected for verification by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: In blastic crisis, 68 of the 1176 tested genes were obviously up-regulated. Sixteen of these differential genes were selectively expressed in leukocyte membranes. CD40, CCR3, LGALS3, RGS3, CEACAM3 and the related transcription factors RAC1, CTNNB1, TP53, and NF-kappaB, all as the nodes of the entire regulatory network, were presumed to play key roles in disease progression. The results of RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data and showed high expression of CEACAM3, RGS3, CTNNB1 and RAC1 in blastic crisis.

The expression level of FPGS directly influences MTX-sensitivity of tumor cells. Compared with B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cells express a lower level of FPGS, which results in insensitivity of the cells to MTX. Our previous work has demonstrated that 279 bp mbr element located within the 3'-UTR of the BCL2 gene possesses enhancer function. In this study, FPGS expression plasmid containing mbr element at the 5' upstream of the gene was constructed and transfected into Jurkat cells to sensitize the cells to MTX. Western blotting and MTT assay were applied to detect the FPGS expression level and suppression rate of the cells treated by MTX, respectively. We found that the mbr enhanced the expression of FPGS significantly and increased sensitivity of Jurkat cells to MTX efficiently, while FPGS expression plasmid without mbr element had less effect. Our data provides a new clue for the clinical application of mbr regulatory element and may contribute to improvement of MTX treatment in T-ALL.","['Hu, Wen-Jia', 'Sun, Yu-Jie']","['Hu WJ', 'Sun YJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China. lynn111@sohu.com']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Yi Chuan,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['0253-9772(2012)06-705-06 [pii]', '10.3724/sp.j.1005.2012.00705 [doi]']",ppublish,Yi Chuan. 2012 Jun;34(6):705-10. doi: 10.3724/sp.j.1005.2012.00705.,20120920,,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a moderate growth inhibition was found for compound classes of indoles and 1H-pyrazoles.

Phosphorylation events common to breast cancer cells impact PR transcriptional activity, in part by direct phosphorylation. PR-B but not PR-A isoforms are phosphorylated on Ser294 by mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Phospho-Ser294 PRs are resistant to ligand-dependent Lys388 SUMOylation (that is, a repressive modification). Antagonism of PR small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation by mitogenic protein kinases suggests a mechanism for derepression (that is, transcriptional activation) of target genes. As a broad range of PR protein expression is observed clinically, a PR gene signature would provide a valuable marker of PR contribution to early breast cancer progression. METHODS: Global gene expression patterns were measured in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing either wild-type (SUMOylation-capable) or K388R (SUMOylation-deficient) PRs and subjected to pathway analysis. Gene sets were validated by RT-qPCR. Recruitment of coregulators and histone methylation levels were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Changes in cell proliferation and survival were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and western blotting. Finally, human breast tumor cohort datasets were probed to identify PR-associated gene signatures; metagene analysis was employed to define survival rates in patients whose tumors express a PR gene signature. RESULTS: 'SUMO-sensitive' PR target genes primarily include genes required for proliferative and pro-survival signaling. DeSUMOylated K388R receptors are preferentially recruited to enhancer regions of derepressed genes (that is, MSX2, RGS2, MAP1A, and PDK4) with the steroid receptor coactivator, CREB-(cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP), and mixed lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2), a histone methyltransferase mediator of nucleosome remodeling. PR SUMOylation blocks these events, suggesting that SUMO modification of PR prevents interactions with mediators of early chromatin remodeling at 'closed' enhancer regions. SUMO-deficient (phospho-Ser294) PR gene signatures are significantly associated with human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2)-positive luminal breast tumors and predictive of early metastasis and shortened survival. Treatment with antiprogestin or MEK inhibitor abrogated expression of SUMO-sensitive PR target-genes and inhibited proliferation in BT-474 (estrogen receptor (ER)+/PR+/ERBB2+) breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reversible PR SUMOylation/deSUMOylation profoundly alters target gene selection in breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation-induced PR deSUMOylation favors a permissive chromatin environment via recruitment of CBP and MLL2. Patients whose ER+/PR+ tumors are driven by hyperactive (that is, derepressed) phospho-PRs may benefit from endocrine (antiestrogen) therapies that contain an antiprogestin.","['Knutson, Todd P', 'Daniel, Andrea R', 'Fan, Danhua', 'Silverstein, Kevin At', 'Covington, Kyle R', 'Fuqua, Suzanne Aw', 'Lange, Carol A']","['Knutson TP', 'Daniel AR', 'Fan D', 'Silverstein KA', 'Covington KR', 'Fuqua SA', 'Lange CA']","['Departments of Medicine (Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation) and Pharmacology, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA072038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123763/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA116790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK53825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,PMC3446358,2012/06/16 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr3211 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr3211 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 14;14(3):R95. doi: 10.1186/bcr3211.,20130311,,,,"['0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AMC are characterized by being proliferative, phagocytic and migratory whereas the RMC are quiescent and exhibit a slow turnover rate. The AMC transform into RMC with advancing age, and this transformation is indicative of the gradual shift in the microglial functions. Both AMC and RMC respond to CNS inflammation, and they become hypertrophic when activated by trauma, infection or neurodegenerative stimuli. The molecular mechanisms and functional significance of morphological transformation of microglia during normal development and in disease conditions is not clear. It is hypothesized that AMC and RMC are functionally regulated by a specific set of genes encoding various signaling molecules and transcription factors. RESULTS: To address this, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis using lectin-labeled AMC and RMC isolated from frozen tissue sections of the corpus callosum of 5-day and 4-week old rat brain respectively, by laser capture microdissection. The global gene expression profiles of both microglial phenotypes were compared and the differentially expressed genes in AMC and RMC were clustered based on their functional annotations. This genome wide comparative analysis identified genes that are specific to AMC and RMC. CONCLUSIONS: The novel and specific molecules identified from the trancriptome explains the quiescent state functioning of microglia in its two distinct morphological states.","['Parakalan, Rangarajan', 'Jiang, Boran', 'Nimmi, Baby', 'Janani, Manivannan', 'Jayapal, Manikandan', 'Lu, Jia', 'Tay, Samuel S W', 'Ling, Eng-Ang', 'Dheen, S Thameem']","['Parakalan R', 'Jiang B', 'Nimmi B', 'Janani M', 'Jayapal M', 'Lu J', 'Tay SS', 'Ling EA', 'Dheen ST']","['Department of Anatomy, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Blk MD10, 4 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117597, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,England,BMC Neurosci,BMC neuroscience,100966986,PMC3441342,2012/06/16 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2202-13-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2202-13-64 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Neurosci. 2012 Jun 14;13:64. doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-13-64.,20121214,10.1186/1471-2202-13-64 [doi],,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Id2 protein, rat)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Corpus Callosum/*cytology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Laser Capture Microdissection', 'Microglia/*classification/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Stem Cells', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) is believed to contribute to development and maintenance of ATL. Unlike the other HTLV-1 genes, the hbz gene is encoded on the complementary strand of the provirus and therefore is not under direct control of the promoter within the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus. This promoter can undergo inactivating genetic or epigenetic changes during the course of ATL that eliminates expression of all viral genes except that of hbz. In contrast, repressive modifications are not known to occur on the hbz promoter located in the 3' LTR, and hbz expression has been consistently detected in all ATL patient samples. Although Sp1 regulates basal transcription from the HBZ promoter, other factors that activate transcription remain undefined. In this study, we used a proviral reporter construct deleted of the 5' LTR to show that HBZ upregulates its own expression through cooperation with JunD. Activation of antisense transcription was apparent in serum-deprived cells in which the level of JunD was elevated, and elimination of JunD expression by gene knockout or shRNA-mediated knockdown abrogated this effect. Activation through HBZ and JunD additionally required Sp1 binding at the hbz promoter. These data favor a model in which JunD is recruited to the promoter through Sp1, where it heterodimerizes with HBZ thereby enhancing its activity. Separately, hbz gene expression led to an increase in JunD abundance, and this effect correlated with emergence of features of transformed cells in immortalized fibroblasts. Overall, our results suggest that JunD represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ATL.","['Gazon, Helene', 'Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Cesaire, Raymond', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Barbeau, Benoit', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Peloponese, Jean-Marie Jr']","['Gazon H', 'Lemasson I', 'Polakowski N', 'Cesaire R', 'Matsuoka M', 'Barbeau B', 'Mesnard JM', 'Peloponese JM Jr']","['CPBS, CNRS UMR 5236, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3416116,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00661-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00661-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Sep;86(17):9070-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00661-12.

Here, we show that E-cadherin promotes kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Nanog transcript and protein expression in mESCs via STAT3 phosphorylation and that beta-catenin, and its binding region in E-cadherin, is required for this function. To further investigate the role of E-cadherin in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent pluripotency, E-cadherin null (Ecad(-/-)) mESCs were cultured in LIF/bone morphogenetic protein supplemented medium. Under these conditions, Ecad(-/-) mESCs exhibited partial restoration of cell-cell contact and STAT3 phosphorylation and upregulated Klf4, Nanog, and N-cadherin transcripts and protein. Abrogation of N-cadherin using an inhibitory peptide caused loss of phospho STAT3, Klf4, and Nanog in these cells, demonstrating that N-cadherin supports LIF-dependent pluripotency in this context. We therefore identify a novel molecular mechanism linking E- and N-cadherin to the core circuitry of pluripotency in mESCs. This mechanism may explain the recently documented role of E-cadherin in efficient induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming.","['Hawkins, Kate', 'Mohamet, Lisa', 'Ritson, Sarah', 'Merry, Catherine L R', 'Ward, Christopher M']","['Hawkins K', 'Mohamet L', 'Ritson S', 'Merry CL', 'Ward CM']","['Stem Cell Biology Group, Core Technology Facility, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['G0701165/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,2012/06/15 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1148 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Sep;30(9):1842-51. doi: 10.1002/stem.1148.,20130124,10.1002/stem.1148 [doi],,,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the risk of ELF MF upon breast cancer was later dismissed, repeated reports were published of partial inhibition of MLT secretion in rats under long-term (>/= 4 weeks) exposure to weak ELF MF. Since 2004, however, this topic has not been experimentally studied any more. In the present study, we propose to go back to the MLT hypothesis and apply it to childhood leukemia, for which an increased risk has been robustly associated with residential exposure to ELF MF. Contrary to the original hypothesis, however, we do not consider decreased MLT levels, but disruption of circadian rhythmicity per se as the effector mechanism. Indeed, the role of the circadian timing system in the development of childhood leukemia has been well established. Motivation for going back to the MLT hypothesis comes from recent data that suggest magnetosensory disruption by ELF MF in mammals, and magnetosensitivity in humans, together with current evidence for an influence on circadian rhythmicity from disruption of non-photic sensory stimuli of various natures. We thus suggest further study on circadian rhythmicity in humans (children if possible) under long-term exposure to weak ELF MF.","['Vanderstraeten, Jacques', 'Verschaeve, Luc', 'Burda, Hynek', 'Bouland, Catherine', 'de Brouwer, Christophe']","['Vanderstraeten J', 'Verschaeve L', 'Burda H', 'Bouland C', 'de Brouwer C']","['Research Center on Environmental Health and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, CP 593, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium. jacques.vanderstraeten@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120614,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,,2012/06/15 06:00,2013/03/26 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.2761 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2012 Dec;32(12):952-8. doi: 10.1002/jat.2761.

Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are frequently administered during and after chemotherapy to reduce complications. However, their safety with regard to disease-related outcomes and survival in AML is unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of CSFs on patient outcomes, including survival. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety/efficacy of CSFs with regard to disease-related outcomes and survival in patients with AML. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We identified relevant randomized clinical trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2010), LILACS (up to December 2009), databases of ongoing trials and relevant conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that compared the addition of CSFs during and following chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with AML. We excluded trials evaluating the role of CSFs administered for the purpose of stem cell collection and/or priming (e.g. before and/or only for the duration of chemotherapy). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors appraised the quality of trials and extracted data. For each trial, we expressed results as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We analyzed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs). MAIN RESULTS: The search yielded 19 trials including 5256 patients. The addition of CSFs to chemotherapy yielded no difference in all-cause mortality at 30 days and at the end of follow up (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18 and RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05, respectively) or in overall survival (HR 1.00; 95% 0.93 to 1.08). There was no difference in complete remission rates (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07), relapse rates (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05) and disease-free survival (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13). CSFs did not decrease the occurrence of bacteremias (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12), nor the occurrence of invasive fungal infections (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.19). CSFs marginally increased adverse events requiring discontinuation of CSFs as compared to the control arm (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.56). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, colony-stimulating factors should not be given routinely to acute myelogenous leukemia patients post-chemotherapy since they do not affect overall survival or infectious parameters including the rate of bacteremias and invasive fungal infections.","['Gurion, Ronit', 'Belnik-Plitman, Yulia', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Paul, Mical', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Gurion R', 'Belnik-Plitman Y', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Paul M', 'Vidal L', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Shpilberg O', 'Raanani P']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Center, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20120613,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,PMC7390444,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008238.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Jun 13;(6):CD008238. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008238.pub3.,20120813,10.1002/14651858.CD008238.pub3 [doi],,,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(9):CD008238.

However, it is unclear how the cytotoxicity of flavonoids depends on the ease of their single-electron oxidation in aqueous medium, i.e., the redox potential of the phenoxyl radical/phenol couple. We verified the previously calculated redox potentials for several flavonoids according to their rates of reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide, and proposed experimentally-based values of redox potentials for myricetin, fisetin, morin, kaempferol, galangin, and naringenin. We found that the cytotoxicity of flavonoids (n=10) in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) and murine hepatoma (line MH-22a) increases with a decrease in their redox potential of the phenoxyl radical/phenol couple and an increase in their lipophilicity. Their cytotoxicity was decreased by antioxidants and inhibitors of cytochromes P-450, alpha-naphthoflavone and isoniazide, and increased by an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, 3,5-dinitrocatechol. It shows that although the prooxidant action of flavonoids may be the main factor in their cytotoxicity, the hydroxylation and oxidative demethylation by cytochromes P-450 and O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase can significantly modulate the cytotoxicity of the parent compounds.","['Maroziene, Audrone', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Vidziunaite, Regina', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Maroziene A', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Vidziunaite R', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Biochemistry of Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['2011_223 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2012;59(2):299-305.

MDS occurs more frequently in older male and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry or molecular genetics is complementary but not diagnostic. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system is the International Prognostic Scoring System. IPSS is likely to be replaced by a new revised score (IPSS-R) and by the incorporation of new molecular markers recently described. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts, and, more recently, cytogenetic profile. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-azacitidine and decitabine have activity in higher risk MDS. 5-azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. A number of new molecular lesions have been described in MDS that may serve as new therapeutic targets or aid in the selection of currently available agents. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE OR REFRACTORY DISEASE: At the present time there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include cytarabine based therapy, transplantation and participation on a clinical trial.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']",['Garcia-Manero G'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23264 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Jul;87(7):692-701. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23264.,20120827,10.1002/ajh.23264 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of p53 has not been implicated as important for the development of CML. Mutations in p53 protein are infrequent, however they correlate with the disease progression. The absence of p53 mutations does not exclude the possibility that other dysfunctions play an important role in CML pathology. Acetylation represents a very potent posttranslational mechanism regulating p53 stability, transcriptional activity and localization. In this study we have investigated whether the expression of BCR-ABL could influence the acetylation of p53, specifically at lysine 317/320 (K317/K320), which has been shown to regulate nuclear export and transcription-independent apoptotic activity of p53. We found that BCR-ABL expression increases K317 acetylation of p53 and is able to prevent a drop in acetylation observed upon DNA damage, followed by translocation of p53 to the cytoplasm and by Bax activation. We have shown that this site plays a crucial role in the regulation of p53 localization and p53-dependent, Bax-mediated apoptosis. Our study presents a novel BCR-ABL-dependent mechanism protecting from DNA-damage-induced cell death. It can, in addition to already known mechanisms, explain the resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis observed in CML cells expressing wt p53. We propose that the acetyltransferases regulating the p53 acetylation could be an interesting and potent target for therapeutic intervention.","['Kusio-Kobialka, Monika', 'Wolanin, Kamila', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Sikora, Ewa', 'Skowronek, Krzysztof', 'McKenna, Sharon L', 'Ghizzoni, Massimo', 'Dekker, Frank J', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna']","['Kusio-Kobialka M', 'Wolanin K', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Sikora E', 'Skowronek K', 'McKenna SL', 'Ghizzoni M', 'Dekker FJ', 'Piwocka K']","['Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, 3 Pasteur Street, 02-093, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,2012/06/15 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-012-0739-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Sep;17(9):950-63. doi: 10.1007/s10495-012-0739-9.,20131223,10.1007/s10495-012-0739-9 [doi],,,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to clarify hMSC origin and disclose possible cytogenetic heterogeneity in hMSC belonging to different patients, bone marrow (BM)-derived hMSC samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were expanded in culture, characterized by flow cytometry, and screened by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization for the presence of possible cytogenetic aberrations, related or not to the hematopoietic neoplastic clone. Our data showed that the presence of cytogenetic aberrations in successfully expanded HM-MSC stromal layers derives from the persistence of contaminating hemopoietic cells (HC), which is greatly supported by in vitro culture conditions that could mimic in vivo microenvironmental niche. Interestingly, the presence of binucleated HM-MSC maintaining a diploid numerical setting has been also detected, while aneuploidies were observed more frequently in mononucleated HM-MSC from patients with an altered karyotype than in patients with a normal karyotype and controls. In conclusion, here, we showed that in ALL and in CLL, the BM-MSC has a normal karyotype, thus supporting a distinct origin from hematopoietic cells (HC). The presence of in vitro hMSC aneuploidy is associated with lymphoid neoplasias carrying chromosome abnormalities, suggesting that hMSC should be characterized before clinical application. The adequacy of hMSC cytogenetic characterization here proposed could represent a ""prerequisite"" to standardize the hMSC analysis before their use in the autologous setting and cellular therapy.","['Campioni, Diana', 'Bardi, M Antonella', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Tammiso, Elisa', 'Pezzolo, Elisa', 'Pregnolato, Emma', 'Volta, Eleonora', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Lanza, Francesco']","['Campioni D', 'Bardi MA', 'Cavazzini F', 'Tammiso E', 'Pezzolo E', 'Pregnolato E', 'Volta E', 'Cuneo A', 'Lanza F']","['Section of Hematology, University-S Anna Hospital, Ferrara, Italy. cmpdni@unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120614,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1500-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Oct;91(10):1563-77. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1500-8.

Notch2 appears to play some specific roles in the intestinal immunity, given that the fate of mast cells and a subset of DCs is regulated by Notch2 in the intestine. Notch2 also has important roles in helper T cell divergence from naive CD4 T cells and activation of cytotoxic T cells. Moreover, recent genetic evidence suggests that both gain-and loss-of-function abnormalities of Notch2 cause transformation of immune cells.

Notch1 activation is essential for T-cell specification of bone marrow-derived multipotent progenitors that seed the thymus, and for proliferation and further progression of early thymocytes along the T-cell lineage. Deregulated activation of Notch1 significantly contributes to the generation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). In addition to Notch1 signals, survival and proliferation signals provided by the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) are also required during thymopoiesis. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling stage-specific survival and proliferation signals provided by Notch1 and IL-7R has recently been improved by the discovery that the IL-7R is a transcriptional target of Notch1. Thus, Notch1 controls T-cell development, in part by regulating the stage- and lineage-specific expression of IL-7R. The finding that induction of IL-7R expression downstream of Notch1 also occurs in T-ALL highlights the important contribution that deregulated IL-7R expression and function may have in this pathology. Confirming this notion, oncogenic IL7R gain-of-function mutations have recently been identified in childhood T-ALL. Here we discuss the fundamental role of Notch1 and IL-7R signalling pathways in physiological and pathological T-cell development in mice and men, highlighting their close molecular underpinnings.","['Gonzalez-Garcia, Sara', 'Garcia-Peydro, Marina', 'Alcain, Juan', 'Toribio, Maria L']","['Gonzalez-Garcia S', 'Garcia-Peydro M', 'Alcain J', 'Toribio ML']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular, Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, 28049, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,,2012/06/15 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/82_2012_231 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2012;360:47-73. doi: 10.1007/82_2012_231.,20130122,10.1007/82_2012_231 [doi],,,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the discovery of RNA transcripts from two putative endogenous gammaretroviruses in frugivorous (Rousettus leschenaultii retrovirus, RlRV) and insectivorous (Megaderma lyra retrovirus, MlRV) bat species. Both genomes possess a large deletion in pol, indicating that they are defective retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places RlRV and MlRV within the diversity of mammalian gammaretroviruses, with the former falling closer to porcine endogenous retroviruses and the latter to Mus dunni endogenous virus, koala retrovirus and gibbon ape leukemia virus. Additional genomic mining suggests that both microbat (Myotis lucifugus) and megabat (Pteropus vampyrus) genomes harbour many copies of endogenous retroviral forms related to RlRV and MlRV.

Taken together, this study indicates that bats harbour distinct gammaretroviruses and may have played an important role as reservoir hosts during the diversification of mammalian gammaretroviruses.","['Cui, Jie', 'Tachedjian, Gilda', 'Tachedjian, Mary', 'Holmes, Edward C', 'Zhang, Shuyi', 'Wang, Lin-Fa']","['Cui J', 'Tachedjian G', 'Tachedjian M', 'Holmes EC', 'Zhang S', 'Wang LF']","['Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia.', 'Retroviral Biology and Antivirals Laboratory, Centre for Virology, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria 3220, Australia.', 'Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular Ecology and Evolution, Institutes for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, PR China.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria 3220, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,PMC7346494,2012/06/15 06:00,2012/10/27 06:00,['2012/06/15 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.043760-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2012 Sep;93(Pt 9):2037-2045. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.043760-0.

The cytologic diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas composed of small-/intermediate-sized cells, however, has been seen as an area of great difficulty even for experienced observers due to the morphologic overlap between lymphoma and reactive lymphadenopathies as well as between the lymphoma entities themselves. Although ancillary testing has improved diagnostic accuracy, the results from these tests must be interpreted within the morphological and clinical context to avoid misinterpretation. Importantly, the recognition of specific cytologic features is crucial in guiding the appropriate selection of ancillary tests which will either confirm or refute a tentative diagnosis. For these reasons, we here review the cytologic characteristics particular to five common B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas which typically cause the most diagnostic confusion based on cytological assessment alone: marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. We summarize the most pertinent cytomorphologic features for each entity as well as for reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, contrast them with each other to facilitate their recognition, and highlight common diagnostic pitfalls.","['Schwock, Joerg', 'Geddie, William R']","['Schwock J', 'Geddie WR']","['Division of Anatomical Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto General Hospital, Room E11-219, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 2C4.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120527,United States,Patholog Res Int,Pathology research international,101526292,PMC3368210,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/06/14 06:01,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/164934 [doi]'],ppublish,Patholog Res Int. 2012;2012:164934. doi: 10.1155/2012/164934.

Pre-B cells transformed with the viral oncogene v-Abl are suspended in an immortalized, cycling state that mimics leukemias with a BCR-ABL1 translocation, such as Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Inhibition of the oncogenic Abl kinase with imatinib reverses transformation, allowing progression to the next stage of B cell development. We employed a genome-wide polysome profiling assay called Gradient Encoding to investigate the extent and potential contribution of translational regulation to transformation and differentiation in v-Abl-transformed pre-B cells. Over half of the significantly translationally regulated genes did not change significantly at the level of mRNA abundance, revealing biology that might have been missed by measuring changes in transcript abundance alone. We found extensive, gene-specific changes in translation affecting genes with known roles in B cell signaling and differentiation, cancerous transformation, and cytoskeletal reorganization potentially affecting adhesion. These results highlight a major role for gene-specific translational regulation in remodeling the gene expression program in differentiation and malignant transformation.","['Bates, Jamie G', 'Salzman, Julia', 'May, Damon', 'Garcia, Patty B', 'Hogan, Gregory J', 'McIntosh, Martin', 'Schlissel, Mark S', 'Brown, Pat O']","['Bates JG', 'Salzman J', 'May D', 'Garcia PB', 'Hogan GJ', 'McIntosh M', 'Schlissel MS', 'Brown PO']","['Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01HL48702/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA111487/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA150974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA111487/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL048702/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120531,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3365017,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0037108 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-01455 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37108. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037108.

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that function as transcriptional repressors downregulate the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 and increase the activity of selective BH3 mimetics that fail to target this protein. In this study, we determined whether CDK inhibitors potentiate the activity of pan-BH3 mimetics directly neutralizing Mcl-1. Specifically, we evaluated interactions between the prototypical pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and the pan-BH3 mimetic obatoclax in multiple myeloma (MM) cells in which Mcl-1 is critical for survival. Coadministration of flavopiridol and obatoclax synergistically triggered apoptosis in both drug-naive and drug-resistant MM cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that flavopiridol inhibited Mcl-1 transcription but increased transcription of Bim and its binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. Obatoclax prevented Mcl-1 recovery and caused release of Bim from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, accompanied by activation of Bax/Bak. Whether administered singly or in combination with obatoclax, flavopiridol also induced upregulation of multiple BH3-only proteins, including BimEL, BimL, Noxa, and Bik/NBK. Notably, short hairpin RNA knockdown of Bim or Noxa abrogated lethality triggered by the flavopiridol/obatoclax combination in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings show that CDK inhibition potentiates pan-BH3 mimetic activity through a cooperative mechanism involving upregulation of BH3-only proteins with coordinate downregulation of their antiapoptotic counterparts. These findings have immediate implications for the clinical trial design of BH3 mimetic-based therapies that are presently being studied intensively for the treatment of diverse hematopoietic malignancies, including lethal multiple myeloma.","['Chen, Shuang', 'Dai, Yun', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Myers, Jennifer', 'Wang, Li', 'Kramer, Lora B', 'Garnett, Mandy', 'Schwartz, Daniella M', 'Su, Florence', 'Simmons, Gary L', 'Richey, Justin D', 'Larsen, Dustin G', 'Dent, Paul', 'Orlowski, Robert Z', 'Grant, Steven']","['Chen S', 'Dai Y', 'Pei XY', 'Myers J', 'Wang L', 'Kramer LB', 'Garnett M', 'Schwartz DM', 'Su F', 'Simmons GL', 'Richey JD', 'Larsen DG', 'Dent P', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['1 P50 CA142509-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA141703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA016059-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 P50 CA130805-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA150214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC3421040,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-1118 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1118 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 15;72(16):4225-37. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1118.

We investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a sugar analog with dual activity of inhibiting glycolysis and N-linked glycosylation, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We found that, unlike most other cancer phenotypes in which 2-DG only inhibits cell proliferation under normoxic conditions, ALL lymphoblasts undergo apoptosis. Bp-ALL cell lines and primary cells exhibited sensitivity to 2-DG, whereas T-ALL cells were relatively resistant, revealing phenotypic differences within ALL subtypes. Cotreatment with D-mannose, a sugar essential for N-linked glycosylation, rescues 2-DG-treated ALL cells, indicating that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation and induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) is the predominant mechanism of 2-DG's cytotoxicity in ALL. 2-DG-treated ALL cells exhibit upregulation of P-AMPK, P-Akt, and induction of ER stress/UPR markers (IRE1alpha, GRP78, P-eIF2alpha, and CHOP), which correlate with PARP cleavage and apoptosis. In addition, we find that pharmacologic and genetic Akt inhibition upregulates P-AMPK, downregulates UPR, and sensitizes ALL cells to remarkably low doses of 2-DG (0.5 mmol/L), inducing 85% cell death and overcoming the relative resistance of T-ALL. In contrast, AMPK knockdown rescues ALL cells by upregulating the prosurvival UPR signaling. Therefore, 2-DG induces ALL cell death under normoxia by inducing ER stress, and AKT and AMPK, traditionally thought to operate predominantly on the glycolytic pathway, differentially regulate UPR activity to determine cell death or survival.","['DeSalvo, Joanna', 'Kuznetsov, Jeffim N', 'Du, Jianfeng', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'Lampidis, Theodore J', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['DeSalvo J', 'Kuznetsov JN', 'Du J', 'Leclerc GM', 'Leclerc GJ', 'Lampidis TJ', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,,2012/06/14 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0125 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0125 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2012 Jul;10(7):969-78. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0125.

No study has so far examined the association between the number of lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis and overall survival (OS). We examined this relationship in adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: A longitudinal prospective study was conducted on 28 AML patients. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were obtained before chemotherapy to quantify the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK), invariant NKT (iNKT), and type-1 and type-2 dendritic cells. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard model were used to determine significant association between the number of each cell subtype and survival. RESULTS: BM counts of CD4+ lymphocytes >506.11/muL and CD8+ T lymphocytes >556.02/muL and a PB count of iNKT cells <0.2/muL were associated with poor OS by univariate analysis (P = 0.015, P = 0.009, P = 0.033 respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that an iNKT count <0.2 cells/muL is an independent prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION: An iNKT cell number of <0.2/muL confers a poor prognosis in de novo AML patients.","['Najera Chuc, Alicia E', 'Cervantes, Laura A Montiel', 'Retiguin, Flor Perez', 'Ojeda, Jorge Vela', 'Maldonado, Elba Reyes']","['Najera Chuc AE', 'Cervantes LA', 'Retiguin FP', 'Ojeda JV', 'Maldonado ER']","['Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Prol.

It has been now more than 50 years from the demonstration that blood cells derive from a common ancestor called Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) McCulloch and Till (1960). Thus, the hematopoietic process relies on the unlimited and distinctive self-renewal ability of HSC, which in the adult mammalian organisms reside in the bone marrow, but their generation occurs during embryonic life. Questions still remain about how HSCs acquire and maintain the features of self-renewal and pluripotency that define stem-cell populations. Notch is a crucial signaling pathway involved in the generation of cell diversity and stem-cell maintenance in different systems. In some cases, Notch prevents differentiation, while in other contexts Notch directly participates in promoting cell differentiation. In the following sections, we will review what is known about the role of Notch in HSC establishment and hematopoietic cell lineage specification.","['Bigas, Anna', ""D'Altri, Teresa"", 'Espinosa, Lluis']","['Bigas A', ""D'Altri T"", 'Espinosa L']","['Program in Cancer Research.

In an attempt to offer a new target for treating B-cell malignancies, in this study, the authors tested the possibility of using the CD40/CD40L system as a common targeting system for the various malignancies in this group. METHODS: Two chimeric proteins, soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L)-caspase 3 (sCD40L-l-Caspase3) and sCD40L-pseudomonas exotoxin 38 (PE38) (sCD40L-l-PE38), were constructed, expressed, and partially purified. The ability of the chimeric proteins to kill tumor cells that expressed CD40 was tested by using proliferation assays. In addition, the induction of apoptosis in treated cells was followed by measuring expression levels of apoptotic proteins using real-time polymerases chain reaction analysis, caspase 3 enzymatic activity, and tracking changes in the cell cycle with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. RESULTS: The chimeric proteins exhibited concentration-dependent and time-dependent killing ability. The new chimeric proteins had no effect in several carcinoma cell lines that did not express the CD40 receptor. Treating tumor cells with sCD40L-based chimeric proteins led to internalization of the fusion proteins into the cell cytoplasm of B cells. Shortly after treatment, a sharp rise in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression levels occurred. Approximately 36 hours after the initiation of treatment, Bcl2 levels dropped, whereas Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) expression levels rose, pushing the cells toward apoptosis. Concomitantly, caspase 3 RNA levels rose. CONCLUSIONS: sCD40L-based chimeric proteins were able to bind and internalize into B cells that expressed the CD40 receptor and specifically and efficiently induced apoptotic death. Moreover, the current results validated for the first time the ability of sCD40L to serve as a direct delivery system for targeted molecules. sCD40L-based chimeric cytotoxic proteins offer a new weapon in the everlasting war against cancer.","['Kedar, Rotem', 'Sabag, Ofra', 'Licthenstein, Michal', 'Lorberboum-Galski, Haya']","['Kedar R', 'Sabag O', 'Licthenstein M', 'Lorberboum-Galski H']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120612,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2012/06/14 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27654 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;118(24):6089-104. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27654.

The mechanism by which this agent cures this disease was previously shown to involve direct interactions between ATO and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), as well as accelerated degradation of the APL-associated fusion oncoprotein PML/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). Here we investigated the fate of PML-generated nuclear structures called PML bodies in ATO-treated cells. We found that ATO inhibits formation of progeny PML bodies while it stabilizes cytoplasmic precursor compartments, referred to as cytoplasmic assemblies of PML and nucleoporins (CyPNs), after cell division. This block in PML body recycling is readily detected at pharmacologic relevant ATO concentrations (0.02-0.5muM) that do not cause detectable cell-cycle defects, and it does not require modification of PML by SUMOylation. In addition, PML and PML/RARA carrying mutations previously identified in ATO-resistant APL patients are impeded in their ability to become sequestered within CyPNs. Thus, ATO may inhibit nuclear activities of PML and PML/RARA in postmitotic cells through CyPN-dependent cytoplasmic sequestration.","['Lang, Emma', 'Grudic, Amra', 'Pankiv, Serhiy', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Simonsen, Anne', 'Bjerkvig, Rolf', 'Bjoras, Magnar', 'Boe, Stig Ove']","['Lang E', 'Grudic A', 'Pankiv S', 'Bruserud O', 'Simonsen A', 'Bjerkvig R', 'Bjoras M', 'Boe SO']","['Department of Microbiology, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Centre of Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46584-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-388496 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):847-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388496.

TCL1 is expressed in ~ 90% of human CLL. Transgenic expression of TCL1 in murine B cells (Emu-TCL1) results in mouse CLL. Here we show for the first time that the previously unexplored endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is aberrantly activated in Emu-TCL1 mouse and human CLL. This includes activation of the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway and the transcriptionally up-regulated expression of Derlin-1, Derlin-2, BiP, GRP94, and PDI. TCL1 associates with the XBP-1 transcription factor, and causes the dysregulated expression of the transcription factors, Pax5, IRF4, and Blimp-1, and of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase. In addition, TCL1-overexpressing CLL cells manufacture a distinctly different BCR, as we detected increased expression of membrane-bound IgM and altered N-linked glycosylation of Igalpha and Igbeta, which account for the hyperactive BCR in malignant CLL. To demonstrate that the ER stress-response pathway is a novel molecular target for the treatment of CLL, we blocked the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway using a novel inhibitor, and observed apoptosis and significantly stalled growth of CLL cells in vitro and in mice. These studies reveal an important role of TCL1 in activating the ER stress response in support for malignant progression of CLL.","['Kriss, Crystina L', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier A', 'Mailloux, Adam W', 'Powers, John J', 'Tang, Chih-Hang Anthony', 'Kang, Chang Won', 'Zanesi, Nicola', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo M', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Del Valle, Juan R', 'Hu, Chih-Chi Andrew']","['Kriss CL', 'Pinilla-Ibarz JA', 'Mailloux AW', 'Powers JJ', 'Tang CH', 'Kang CW', 'Zanesi N', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Sotomayor EM', 'Croce CM', 'Del Valle JR', 'Hu CC']","['Department of Immunology, H.

To investigate the role of ACAs in early CP CML patients treated with imatinib mesylate, we performed an analysis in a large series of 559 patients enrolled in 3 prospective trials of the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto Working Party on CML: 378 patients were evaluable and ACAs occurred in 21 patients (5.6%). The overall cytogenetic and molecular response rates were significantly lower and the time to response was significantly longer in patients with ACAs. The long-term outcome of patients with ACAs was inferior, but the differences were not significant. The prognostic significance of each specific cytogenetic abnormality was not assessable. Therefore, we confirm that ACAs constitute an adverse prognostic factor in CML patients treated with imatinib as frontline therapy.","['Luatti, Simona', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Marzocchi, Giulia', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Zanatta, Lucia', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Zaccaria, Alfonso', 'Grimoldi, Maria Grazia', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Ameli, Gaia', 'Capucci, Maria Adele', 'Palka, Giandomenico', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Palandri, Francesca', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Testoni, Nicoletta']","['Luatti S', 'Castagnetti F', 'Marzocchi G', 'Baldazzi C', 'Gugliotta G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Specchia G', 'Zanatta L', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Mancini M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Zaccaria A', 'Grimoldi MG', 'Gozzetti A', 'Ameli G', 'Capucci MA', 'Palka G', 'Bernasconi P', 'Palandri F', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Martinelli G', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M', 'Testoni N']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology L. e A.

In the present study, we present the cellular and molecular roles of the Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav in lymphoid leukemogenesis and explore the roles of Vav proteins in BCR-ABL-dependent signaling. We show that genetic deficiency of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav3 delays leukemogenesis by p190-BCR-ABL and phenocopies the effect of Rac2 deficiency, a downstream effector of Vav3. Compensatory up-regulation of expression and activation of Vav3 in Vav1/Vav2-deficient B-cell progenitors increases the transformation ability of p190-BCR-ABL. Vav3 deficiency induces apoptosis of murine and human leukemic lymphoid progenitors, decreases the activation of Rho GTPase family members and p21-activated kinase, and is associated with increased Bad phosphorylation and up-regulation of Bax, Bak, and Bik. Finally, Vav3 activation only partly depends on ABL TK activity, and Vav3 deficiency collaborates with tyrosine kinase inhibitors to inhibit CrkL activation and impair leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that Vav3 represents a novel specific molecular leukemic effector for multitarget therapy in p190-BCR-ABL-expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Chang, Kyung Hee', 'Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Sengupta, Amitava', 'Madhu, Malav N', 'Ficker, Ashley M', 'Dunn, Susan K', 'Kuenzi, Ashley M', 'Arnett, Jorden L', 'Santho, Rebecca A', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Bustelo, Xose R', 'Williams, David A', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Chang KH', 'Sanchez-Aguilera A', 'Shen S', 'Sengupta A', 'Madhu MN', 'Ficker AM', 'Dunn SK', 'Kuenzi AM', 'Arnett JL', 'Santho RA', 'Agirre X', 'Perentesis JP', 'Deininger MW', 'Zheng Y', 'Bustelo XR', 'Williams DA', 'Cancelas JA']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH;""]",['eng'],"['R01 DK062757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK62757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3412345,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46579-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-361709 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):800-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-361709.

The innate response that facilitates viral control in the cornea is currently unknown. In the present study using a mouse chimera model, we found that a bone marrow component is crucial in inhibiting viral replication and identified inflammatory monocytes (F4/80(+) Gr1(+)) as the responsible cell. CCL2 was critical for recruiting inflammatory monocytes, and a loss of this chemokine in CCL2(-/-) mice resulted in a loss of viral containment and inflammatory monocyte recruitment. To confirm these results, clodronate depletion of inflammatory monocytes resulted in elevated viral titers. Furthermore, siRNA targeting the innate sensor p204/IFI-16 resulted in a loss of CCL2 production. In conclusion, CCL2 expression driven by IFI-16 recognition of HSV-1 facilitates the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into the cornea proper to control viral replication.","['Conrady, C D', 'Zheng, M', 'Mandal, N A', 'van Rooijen, N', 'Carr, D J J']","['Conrady CD', 'Zheng M', 'Mandal NA', 'van Rooijen N', 'Carr DJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007633/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,United States,Mucosal Immunol,Mucosal immunology,101299742,PMC3449026,2012/06/14 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mi201246 [pii]', '10.1038/mi.2012.46 [doi]']",ppublish,Mucosal Immunol. 2013 Jan;6(1):45-55. doi: 10.1038/mi.2012.46.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs. The prognostic value of miRNAs in AML is yet to be determined. Here, we set out to identify miRNAs that are consistent significant prognostic determinants, independent from other known prognostic factors. A discovery cohort (n=167) and validation cohort (n=409) of a heterogeneous AML population were used to reliably identify miRNAs with prognostic value. We report miR-212 as an independent prognostic factor, significantly associated with a prolonged overall survival (OS) and also event-free and relapse-free survival in a discovery cohort (hazard ratio (HR)s=0.77, P=0.015 for OS) that was subsequently confirmed in an independent validation cohort of 409 cases (HR=0.83, P=0.016). The prognostic significance and the prevalence of high miR-212 did not correlate with specific (cyto)genetic subtypes of AML. High miR-212 expression levels are associated with a gene expression profile that is significantly enriched for genes involved in the immune response. MiR-212 may improve the current prognostic risk stratification of mixed AML including normal karyotype AML and AML with cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities.","['Sun, S M', 'Rockova, V', 'Bullinger, L', 'Dijkstra, M K', 'Dohner, H', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, M']","['Sun SM', 'Rockova V', 'Bullinger L', 'Dijkstra MK', 'Dohner H', 'Lowenberg B', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/14 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):100-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.158.

The purpose of this review is to discuss factors that contribute to the outcome disparities in AYAs with ALL as well as approaches that can be taken to optimize the care of this patient population. RECENT FINDINGS: AYAs with ALL are unique and have outcomes that have lagged behind those observed in children with ALL. Contributing factors to the challenges faced by this group include distinctive disease biology, different drug pharmacology and toxicity profiles, and complex psychosocial and socioeconomic factors. Several clinical trials conducted worldwide have demonstrated that treatment with pediatric protocols significantly improves outcomes in the AYA population. SUMMARY: Initiatives to improve outcomes for AYAs with ALL include treatment with pediatric regimens tailored to be delivered without excessive toxicity and in centers with the necessary supportive care and medical services to address the specific needs of this population. As more is understood about the unique disease biology of AYA ALL, targeted therapeutic approaches may offer promise for the future.","['McNeer, Jennifer L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A']","['McNeer JL', 'Raetz EA']","[""Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32835538f8 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2012 Sep;24(5):487-94. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32835538f8.,20121019,10.1097/CCO.0b013e32835538f8 [doi],,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Faithful synthesis of long cDNA on highly structured RNA templates requires thermostable and processive reverse transcriptases.

We have previously characterized a mutant form of the amphotropic murine retrovirus receptor human phosphate transporter 2 (PiT2) wherein the single substitution of a glutamic acid for the lysine residue at position 522 of this receptor is sufficient to render it to function as a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) receptor. RESULTS: In this study we analyzed the binding affinity of the mutant receptor PiT2K522E and determined that it has a 1000 fold decreased GALV envelope binding affinity compared to the GALV wild type receptor. The decreased affinity does not restrict the initiation of cell-free GALV infection. The diminished binding affinity does, however, correlate with a decrease in the ability of GALV to spread in cells expressing this mutant receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced ability of GALV to subsequently spread among cells expressing PiT2K522E is likely resulted from reduced cell-cell transmission, the decreased ability of PiT2K522E-expressing cells to establish superinfection interference, and attendant cytopathic affects.","['Liu, Meihong', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Liu M', 'Eiden MV']","['Section on Directed Gene Transfer, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120612,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC3418563,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-51 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Jun 12;9:51. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-51.,20121214,10.1186/1742-4690-9-51 [doi],,,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cricetinae', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Giant Cells/virology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Superinfection/*virology', '*Viral Interference', '*Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we showed that APOBEC3 expressed in mammary epithelia cells function to limit milk-borne transmission of the beta-retrovirus, mouse mammary tumor virus. In this present study, we used APOBEC3 knockout mice and their wild type counterpart to query the role of APOBEC3 in sexual transmission of LP-BM5 MLV - the etiological agent of murine AIDs (mAIDs). RESULTS: We show that mouse APOBEC3 is expressed in murine genital tract tissues and gametes and that genital tract tissue of APOBEC3-deficient mice are more susceptible to infection by LP-BM5 virus. APOBEC3 expressed in genital tract tissues most likely plays a role in decreasing virus transmission via the sexual route, since mice deficient in APOBEC3 gene have higher genitalia and seminal plasma virus load and sexually transmit the virus more efficiently to their partners compared to APOBEC3+ mice. Moreover, we show that female mice sexually infected with LP-BM5 virus transmit the virus to their off-spring in APOBEC3-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that genital tissue intrinsic APOBEC3 restricts genital tract infection and limits sexual transmission of LP-BM5 virus.","['Jones, Philip H', 'Mehta, Harshini V', 'Okeoma, Chioma M']","['Jones PH', 'Mehta HV', 'Okeoma CM']","['Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242-1109, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 AI081899/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC3418182,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-50 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Jun 12;9:50. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-50.,20121214,10.1186/1742-4690-9-50 [doi],,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility/metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'Genitalia/metabolism/*virology', 'Germ Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/metabolism/*transmission/virology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral/metabolism/*transmission', 'Splenomegaly/virology', 'Viral Load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: SSc patients who fulfilled the ACR criteria and had inflammatory arthritis followed in The Scleroderma Programme at the Mount Sinai and Toronto Western Hospitals, Toronto, Canada who received a TNF inhibitors for 12 months or more were retrospectively reviewed. Safety outcomes included development of TNF inhibitor related side effects, malignancy and death. Effectiveness outcomes included swollen joint count, tender joint count, skin score, and self-reported pain score at 12 months, compared to baseline. RESULTS: Ten SSc patients were identified: 7 (70%) were female and 6 (60%) had diffuse disease with a median skin score of 6. Six patients (60%) had ILD. At 12 months, the median swollen joint count and tender joint count significantly decreased from 10 to 0 (p<0.01) and 15 to 3 (p=0.02), respectively. The median pain score decreased from 6 to 3.5 (p=0.10). The median skin score remained unchanged at 6 months. The FVC and DLCO changed from 86% and 65% respectively, to 80% and 75% respectively. One patient developed uncomplicated herpes zoster. After 30 months, 3 patients (30%) developed malignancy. No death or other adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: TNF inhibitors appear to be effective in the treatment of SSc-associated inflammatory arthritis. Skin score and lung function did not change significantly with therapy. However, malignancy occurred in one third of patients. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.","['Omair, Mohammed A', 'Phumethum, Veerapong', 'Johnson, Sindhu R']","['Omair MA', 'Phumethum V', 'Johnson SR']","['Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. momair_kfsh@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120529,Italy,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,8308521,,2012/07/26 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['5425 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2012 Mar-Apr;30(2 Suppl 71):S55-9.

We examined the number of apoptotic cells, and analysed the T cells and the T cell receptor gene rearrangements in bone marrow trephines of patients with low-grade MDS [refractory anaemia (RA), refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RAS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD)] to investigate the correlation between T cells and apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow trephines from 30 patients with RA, seven patients with RCMD, four patients with RAS and 11 normal bone marrow donors were stained for CD3 and for apoptotic cells using immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine, 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique, respectively. The positive cells were quantified by computer-assisted image analysis. In addition, CD 8 and T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1)-positive cells were analysed by single staining and evaluated semiquantitatively by light microscopy. Junctional diversity of the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha-, beta- and gamma-chains were analysed in 24 cases of RA and RCMD by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In all cases of RA, RCMD and RAS an increase of apoptotic cells was accompanied by an increase of T cells, when compared to normal donors (P < 0.001). Expression of TIA-1 was found in 33 of 41 patients with low-grade MDS. In contrast, normal controls showed either no or only very weak expression. Furthermore, 14 of 24 cases with low-grade MDS showed clonal TCR gene rearrangement. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that increased apoptosis in low-grade MDS correlates with increased numbers of cytotoxic T cells. A considerable proportion of the MDS cases showed clonal TCR rearrangement suggesting an antigen-driven selection of the T cells. We therefore speculate that cases of MDS can be accompanied by a presumably autoreactive T cell-mediated apoptosis induction in bone marrow cells.","['Pulhorn, Heinke', 'Herrmann, Martin', 'Harms, Harry', 'Jung, Andreas', 'Baumann, Irith']","['Pulhorn H', 'Herrmann M', 'Harms H', 'Jung A', 'Baumann I']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120613,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,2012/06/14 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04209.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2012 Aug;61(2):200-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04209.x.

In the group of BCR-ABL positive patients (25.72%) leukemic blast cells with a more differentiated immunophenotype compared to the BCR-ABL negative group were found.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study conducted on a Mexican mestizo population to report that BCR-ABL negative patients can present a high frequency of undifferentiated immunophenotypes and must therefore be considered as vulnerable as BCR-ABL positive patients.","['Vazquez-Franco, Jose Erasmo', 'Reyes-Maldonado, Elba', 'Montiel-Cervantes, Laura Arcelia', 'Lezama, Ruth Angelica']","['Vazquez-Franco JE', 'Reyes-Maldonado E', 'Montiel-Cervantes LA', 'Lezama RA']","['Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico, DF.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2012 Jan-Feb;64(1):32-9.,20120712,,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*ethnology/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In immunocompromised patients, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis produce diarrhea and systemic dissemination. In Mexico there is not information about microsporidia in children with cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the presence of microsporidia species in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained fecal samples from thirteen patients. The samples were processed to detect microsporidia by both modified Ziehl-Neelsen and clacofluor white stains, DNA was isolated to amplify rRNA specific sequences, to identify E. bieneusi, E. intestinalis, E. cuniculi and E. hellem by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Other parasites and pathogenic bacteria were also tested. RESULTS: Based on morphologic traits 7/13 samples were found positives to microsporidia and 6/10 by PCR. Was identified E. bieneusi in three patients with leukemia and one with lymphoma, another two children with leukemia were infected with E. intestinalis. Almost all children were high-risk patients and in phase of re-induction, consolidation or with many chemotherapy treatments. All the patients with microspiridia did not present diarrhea at the moment of the sampling; however, in two children with diarrhea it was found Cyclospora cayetanensis. Also we obtained feces from five patients' mothers and microsporidia spores were identified by stain in all of them and by PCR it was diagnosed the species in three of them. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that the feces of patients with leukemia or lymphoma had microsporidia, therefore is necessary to know the prevalence of these microorganisms and to analyze their impact in evolution of cancer patients.","['Jimenez-Gonzalez, Gabriela Berenice', 'Martinez-Gordillo, Mario Noe', 'Caballero-Salazar, Silvia', 'Peralta-Abarca, Gustavo Esteban', 'Cardenas-Cardoz, Rocio', 'Arzate-Barbosa, Patricia', 'Ponce-Macotela, Martha']","['Jimenez-Gonzalez GB', 'Martinez-Gordillo MN', 'Caballero-Salazar S', 'Peralta-Abarca GE', 'Cardenas-Cardoz R', 'Arzate-Barbosa P', 'Ponce-Macotela M']","['Parasitologia Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico, DF.']",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,2012/06/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/06/14 06:00'],"['2012/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2012 Jan-Feb;64(1):25-31.,20120712,,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyclospora/isolation & purification', 'Cyclosporiasis/epidemiology/parasitology', 'Encephalitozoon/isolation & purification', 'Encephalitozoonosis/epidemiology', 'Enterocytozoon/isolation & purification', 'Feces/microbiology/parasitology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Microsporidiosis/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Mothers', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,Microsporidiosis en pacientes pediatricos con leucemia o linfoma.,,,,,

Many tumor types, including B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are dependent on BCL2 for survival but become resistant to apoptosis after treatment. Here, we identified a direct interaction between the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and the enzyme PARP1, which suppresses PARP1 enzymatic activity and inhibits PARP1-dependent DNA repair in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 displaced PARP1 from BCL2 in a dose-dependent manner, reestablishing PARP1 activity and DNA repair and promoting nonapoptotic cell death. This form of cell death was unaffected by resistance to single-agent ABT-737 that results from upregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. On the basis of the ability of BCL2 to suppress PARP1 function, we hypothesized that ectopic BCL2 expression would kill PARP inhibitor-sensitive cells. Strikingly, BCL2 expression reduced the survival of PARP inhibitor-sensitive breast cancer and lung cancer cells by 90% to 100%, and these effects were reversed by ABT-737. Taken together, our findings show that a novel interaction between BCL2 and PARP1 blocks PARP1 enzymatic activity and suppresses PARP1-dependent repair. Targeted disruption of the BCL2-PARP1 interaction therefore may represent a potential therapeutic approach for BCL2-expressing tumors resistant to apoptosis.","['Dutta, Chaitali', 'Day, Tovah', 'Kopp, Nadja', 'van Bodegom, Diederik', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Bird, Liat', 'Kommajosyula, Naveen', 'Weigert, Oliver', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Fung, Hua', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Shapiro, Geoffrey I', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Weinstock, David M']","['Dutta C', 'Day T', 'Kopp N', 'van Bodegom D', 'Davids MS', 'Ryan J', 'Bird L', 'Kommajosyula N', 'Weigert O', 'Yoda A', 'Fung H', 'Brown JR', 'Shapiro GI', 'Letai A', 'Weinstock DM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA90578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA090578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC4075432,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-4204 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4204 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 15;72(16):4193-203. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4204.

We performed a nationwide retrospective study of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for ATL in Japan, with special emphasis on the effects of the preconditioning regimen. This is the largest study of ATL patients receiving HSCT. Median overall survival (OS) and 3-year OS of bone marrow or peripheral blood transplantation recipients (n = 586) was 9.9 months (95% confidence interval, 7.4-13.2 months) and 36% (32%-41%), respectively. These values for recipients of myeloablative conditioning (MAC; n = 280) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC; n = 306) were 9.5 months (6.7-18.0 months) and 39% (33%-45%) and 10.0 months (7.2-14.0 months) and 34% (29%-40%), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated 5 significant variables contributing to poorer OS, namely, older age, male sex, not in complete remission, poor performance status, and transplantation from unrelated donors. Although no significant difference in OS between MAC and RIC was observed, there was a trend indicating that RIC contributed to better OS in older patients. Regarding mortality, RIC was significantly associated with ATL-related mortality compared with MAC. In conclusion, allogeneic HSCT not only with MAC but also with RIC is an effective treatment resulting in long-term survival in selected patients with ATL.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Kato, Koji', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Taniguchi, Shuichi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Kato, Koji', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Nishiyama, Takeshi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae']","['Ishida T', 'Hishizawa M', 'Kato K', 'Tanosaki R', 'Fukuda T', 'Taniguchi S', 'Eto T', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Hidaka M', 'Akashi K', 'Uike N', 'Sakamaki H', 'Morishima Y', 'Kato K', 'Suzuki R', 'Nishiyama T', 'Utsunomiya A']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan. itakashi@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49113-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-414490 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 23;120(8):1734-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-414490.

We previously demonstrated a key role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP in the regulation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) stability and formation of PML nuclear bodies. Here, we report the involvement of the E6AP-PML axis in B-cell lymphoma development. A partial loss of E6AP attenuated Myc-induced B-cell lymphomagenesis. This tumor suppressive action was achieved by the induction of cellular senescence. B-cell lymphomas deficient for E6AP expressed elevated levels of PML and PML-nuclear bodies with a concomitant increase in markers of cellular senescence, including p21, H3K9me3, and p16. Consistently, PML deficiency accelerated the rate of Myc-induced B-cell lymphomagenesis. Importantly, E6AP expression was elevated in approximately 60% of human Burkitt lymphomas, and down-regulation of E6AP in B-lymphoma cells restored PML expression with a concurrent induction of cellular senescence in these cells. Our findings demonstrate that E6AP-mediated down-regulation of PML-induced senescence is essential for B-cell lymphoma progression. This provides a molecular explanation for the down-regulation of PML observed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, thereby suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for restoration of tumor suppression in B-cell lymphoma.","['Wolyniec, Kamil', 'Shortt, Jake', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Levav-Cohen, Yaara', 'Alsheich-Bartok, Osnat', 'Louria-Hayon, Igal', 'Corneille, Vincent', 'Kumar, Beena', 'Woods, Simone J', 'Opat, Stephen', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Scott, Clare L', 'Segal, David', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Fox, Stephen', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Jiang, Yong-Hui', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Haupt, Sue', 'Haupt, Ygal']","['Wolyniec K', 'Shortt J', 'de Stanchina E', 'Levav-Cohen Y', 'Alsheich-Bartok O', 'Louria-Hayon I', 'Corneille V', 'Kumar B', 'Woods SJ', 'Opat S', 'Johnstone RW', 'Scott CL', 'Segal D', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Fox S', 'Strasser A', 'Jiang YH', 'Lowe SW', 'Haupt S', 'Haupt Y']","['Research Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, 3002 Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['K12 HD043494/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG016379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3709628,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46581-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-387647 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):822-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-387647.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 485) age >/= 65 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive decitabine 20 mg/m(2) per day as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every 4 weeks or TC (supportive care or cytarabine 20 mg/m(2) per day as a subcutaneous injection for 10 consecutive days every 4 weeks). The primary end point was overall survival (OS); the secondary end point was the complete remission (CR) rate plus the CR rate without platelet recovery (CRp). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: The primary analysis with 396 deaths (81.6%) showed a nonsignificant increase in median OS with decitabine (7.7 months; 95% CI, 6.2 to 9.2) versus TC (5.0 months; 95% CI, 4.3 to 6.3; P = .108; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.04). An unplanned analysis with 446 deaths (92%) indicated the same median OS (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99; nominal P = .037). The CR rate plus CRp was 17.8% with decitabine versus 7.8% with TC (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.8; P = .001). AEs were similar for decitabine and cytarabine, although patients received a median of four cycles of decitabine versus two cycles of TC.

We report the outcome of 31 acute promyelocytic leukemia patients (median age 39 years) who underwent allogeneic transplant in second remission (n=15) or beyond (n=16). Sixteen patients were real-time polymerase chain reaction positive and 15 negative for PML/RARA pre-transplant. The 4-year overall survival was 62% and 31% for patients transplanted in second remission and beyond, respectively (P=0.05), and 64% and 27% for patients with pre-transplant negative and positive real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively (P=0.03). The 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% and 44% for patients transplanted in second remission and beyond, respectively (P=0.37), and 30% and 47% for patients transplanted with negative and positive real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively (P=0.30).

Thus, in this study we investigated the effect of the combination of sorafenib plus nutlin-3 in acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts (n=13) and FLT3(wild-type)/p53(wild-type) (OCI-AML3), FLT3(mutated)/p53(wild-type) (MOLM), FLT3(mutated)/p53(mutated) (MV4-11), FLT3(wild-type)/p53(deleted) (HL60) or FLT3(wild-type)/p53(mutated) (NB4) acute myeloid cell lines were exposed to sorafenib, used alone or in association with nutlin-3 at a 1:1 ratio, in a range of clinically achievable concentrations (1-10 muM). Induction of apoptosis and autophagy was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and by specific flow cytometry analyses. The levels of Mcl-1, p53 and Bak proteins were analyzed by western blotting. Knock-down of Bax and Bak gene expression was performed in transfection experiments with specific short interfering RNA. RESULTS: The sorafenib+nutlin-3 drug combination exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity in primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts and in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with maximal cytotoxicity in FLT3(mutated) MV4-11 and MOLM, followed by the FLT3(wild-type) OCI-AML3, HL60 and NB4 cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of sorafenib+nutlin-3 was characterized by an increase of both apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, Bax and Bak showed prominent roles in mediating the decrease of cell viability in response to the drug combination in p53(wild-type) OCI-AML3 and p53(deleted) HL-60 cells, respectively, as demonstrated in transfection experiments performed with specific short interfering RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia cells show a variable but overall good susceptibility to the innovative therapeutic combination of sorafenib+nutlin-3, which differentially involves the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak in p53(wild-type) and p53(deleted) cells.","['Zauli, Giorgio', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Voltan, Rebecca', 'Ongari, Manuele', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'di Iasio, Maria Grazia', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Zauli G', 'Celeghini C', 'Melloni E', 'Voltan R', 'Ongari M', 'Tiribelli M', 'di Iasio MG', 'Lanza F', 'Secchiero P']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy. giorgio.zauli@unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3487447,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.062083 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.062083 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Nov;97(11):1722-30. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.062083.

Previous studies suggested that RUNX1 mutations may have pathological and prognostic implications. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 93 patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia for RUNX1 mutations by capillary sequencing of genomic DNA. Mutation status was then correlated with clinical data and gene expression profiles. RESULTS: We found that 15 out of 93 (16.1%) patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia had RUNX1 mutations. Seventy-three patients were enrolled in the AMLCG-99 trial and carried ten RUNX1 mutations (13.7%). Among these 73 patients RUNX1 mutations were significantly associated with older age, male sex, absence of NPM1 mutations and presence of MLL-partial tandem duplications. Moreover, RUNX1-mutated patients had a lower complete remission rate (30% versus 73% P=0.01), lower relapse-free survival rate (3-year relapse-free survival 0% versus 30.4%; P=0.002) and lower overall survival rate (3-year overall survival 0% versus 34.4%; P<0.001) than patients with wild-type RUNX1. RUNX1 mutations remained associated with shorter overall survival in a multivariate model including age and the European Leukemia Net acute myeloid leukemia genetic classification as covariates. Patients with RUNX1 mutations showed a unique gene expression pattern with differential expression of 85 genes. The most prominently up-regulated genes in patients with RUNX1-mutated cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia include lymphoid regulators such as HOP homeobox (HOPX), deoxynucleotidyltransferase (DNTT, terminal) and B-cell linker (BLNK), indicating lineage infidelity.

For this study, treatment efficacy was determined among 145 trial patients with morphological forms of acute myeloid leukemia as defined by the French-American-British classification. Leukemia-free survival was strongly improved in M4/M5 (myelomonocytic/monocytic) leukemia but not in M2 (myeloblastic) leukemia. We also analyzed histamine H(2) receptor expression by leukemic cells recovered from 26 newly diagnosed patients. H(2) receptors were typically absent from M2 cells but frequently expressed by M4/M5 cells. M4/M5 cells, but not M2 cells, produced reactive oxygen species that triggered apoptosis in adjacent natural killer cells. These events were significantly inhibited by histamine dihydrochloride.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of myeloid transformation by miR-125b. DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the consequences of miR-125b over-expression on myeloid differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation, we used the NB4 and HL60 human promyelocytic cell lines and the 32Dclone3 murine promyelocytic cell line. To test whether miR-125b is able to transform myeloid cells, we used the non-tumorigenic and interleukin-3-dependent 32Dclone3 cell line over-expressing miR-125b, in xenograft experiments in nude mice and in conditions of interleukin-3 deprivation. To identify new miR-125b targets, we compared, by RNA-sequencing, the transcriptome of cell lines that do or do not over-express miR-125b. RESULTS: We showed that miR-125b over-expression blocks apoptosis and myeloid differentiation and enhances proliferation in both species. More importantly, we demonstrated that miR-125b is able to transform the 32Dclone3 cell line by conferring growth independence from interleukin-3; xenograft experiments showed that these cells form tumors in nude mice. Using RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments, we identified multiple miR-125b targets. We demonstrated that ABTB1, an anti-proliferative factor, is a new direct target of miR-125b and we confirmed that CBFB, a transcription factor involved in hematopoiesis, is also targeted by miR-125b. MiR-125b controls apoptosis by down-regulating genes involved in the p53 pathway including BAK1 and TP53INP1. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in a myeloid context, miR-125b is an oncomiR able to transform cell lines. miR-125b blocks myeloid differentiation in part by targeting CBFB, blocks apoptosis through down-regulation of multiple genes involved in the p53 pathway, and confers a proliferative advantage to human and mouse myeloid cell lines in part by targeting ABTB1.","['Bousquet, Marina', 'Nguyen, Diu', 'Chen, Cynthia', 'Shields, Lauren', 'Lodish, Harvey F']","['Bousquet M', 'Nguyen D', 'Chen C', 'Shields L', 'Lodish HF']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. bousquetmarina@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['DK068348/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068348/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068348/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL066105/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01HL066105/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3487446,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.061515 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.061515 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Nov;97(11):1713-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.061515.

This study assessed whether this inconsistency might be due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, to different relationships in subpopulations such as gender, or to chance. METHODS: We examined cigarette smoking status, initiation, intensity, and duration in relation to the risk of NHL, and subtypes of NHL in men and women from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. From 1992 to 2007, 1,926 NHL cases were identified among 152,958 subjects. Extended Cox regression was used to compute multivariable rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). RESULTS: The RR (95 % CI) for current smoking associated with NHL incidence in women was 1.37 (1.04-1.81) and in men was 0.88 (0.65-1.19). Among current smokers, there was a positive relationship between years smoked and risk of NHL in women (p-trend < 0.01), but no association in men. In women, the positive associations with current smoking were strongest for follicular lymphoma (RR 2.13, 95 % CI 1.20-3.77) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocyte lymphoma (RR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.03-2.96). In men and women combined, current smoking was associated with an increased risk of T-cell lymphoma and a decreased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an association of current smoking with risk of NHL that varies by gender and subtype. Future studies should focus on differences by gender and disease subtype to better clarify the smoking and NHL relationship.","['Diver, W Ryan', 'Patel, Alpa V', 'Thun, Michael J', 'Teras, Lauren R', 'Gapstur, Susan M']","['Diver WR', 'Patel AV', 'Thun MJ', 'Teras LR', 'Gapstur SM']","['Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, 250 Williams Street NW, Atlanta, GA 30033, USA. ryan.diver@cancer.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0001-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Aug;23(8):1231-40. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0001-3.

Therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma MTX is important to monitor efficacy and adverse events. The authors aimed to develop a liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)-based method to determine MTX in plasma for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies. METHODS: Samples were analyzed using a Waters Acquity UPLC and Quattro Premier XE. A Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 mum) was used running an isocratic mobile phase of 21% methanol and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The electrospray was operated in the positive ionization mode monitoring the following mass transitions: m/z 455.2 > 308.2 for MTX and m/z 458.2 > 311.2 for MTXd3. The analysis combined straightforward sample preparation, consisting of dilution and protein precipitation, with a 3-minute run time. RESULTS: The method was linear up to 50 muM (r > 0.99), and the coefficient of variation was <6% for intraday and <10% for interday precision. Average recovery was 99%. There were no significant matrix effects. The lower limit of quantitation, defined as the lowest concentration at which the coefficient of variation <20% and S/N > 1:10, was 5 nM. Method comparison with the Abbott TDx fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA) showed excellent agreement, and a small but significant negative constant bias was detected (LC-MS/MS = 0.98 x FPIA - 7.3). CONCLUSIONS: [corrected] The authors developed a specific and sensitive stable isotope dilution LC-ESI-MS/MS method to monitor MTX concentrations in plasma within the clinically relevant range. The method can be easily applied in clinical laboratories because it combines straightforward sample pretreatment with LC-MS/MS.","['den Boer, Ethan', 'Heil, Sandra G', 'van Zelst, Bertrand D', 'Meesters, Roland J W', 'Koch, Birgit C P', 'Te Winkel, Mariel L', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Luider, Theo M', 'de Jonge, Robert']","['den Boer E', 'Heil SG', 'van Zelst BD', 'Meesters RJ', 'Koch BC', 'Te Winkel ML', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Luider TM', 'de Jonge R']","[""Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, 's Gravendijkwal, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e31825bb368 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2012 Aug;34(4):432-9. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31825bb368.,20130206,10.1097/FTD.0b013e31825bb368 [doi],,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*blood/*chemistry', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the risk of cardiovascular toxicity, leukemia, neurotoxicity, and non-breast cancer-related mortality associated with T added to adjuvant A in breast cancer. PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies included prospective RCTs in which approved T in combination with A (A + T) were compared with A alone as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Summary incidence rates, relative risks (RRs), and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by means of fixed- or random-effects models. A total of 27,039 patients from 15 RCTs were included. Compared with A alone, A + T was associated with a statistically similar risk of toxicity. Compared with control arms, A + T schedules with less cumulative dose of anthracyclines than control arms were associated with lower severe cardiotoxicity (RR = 0.41, [95% CI 0.26-0.66], P = 0.0002), venous thromboembolic events (RR 0.45, [95% CI 0.26-0.79], P = 0.006), and leukemic risk (RR 0.39; [95%CI 0.18-0.87] P = 0.02), but with an increased risk of non-breast cancer-related mortality (RR = 1.79, [95% CI 1.06-3.04] P = 0.03). In particular, this risk of death is greater when >3 cycles of A precede T in sequential schedules (RR 2.24, [1.2-4.21] P = 0.01). This meta-analysis suggests that A + T-based adjuvant chemotherapy is as toxic as A alone with no significant difference in non-breast cancer-related mortality. However, sequential A + T schedules are associated with less toxicity, but a significant increase in non-breast cancer-related mortality compared with control arms with a greater dose of A.","['Petrelli, Fausto', 'Borgonovo, Karen', 'Cabiddu, Mary', 'Lonati, Veronica', 'Barni, Sandro']","['Petrelli F', 'Borgonovo K', 'Cabiddu M', 'Lonati V', 'Barni S']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Oncology, Division of Medical Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Treviglio-Caravaggio, Treviglio, BG, Italy. faupe@libero.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20120612,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-012-2121-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2012 Sep;135(2):335-46. doi: 10.1007/s10549-012-2121-6.

High expression of EVI1 is a negative prognostic indicator of survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) irrespective of the presence of 3q26 rearrangements. However, the only known mechanisms that lead to EVI1 overexpression are 3q aberrations, and the MLL-ENL oncoprotein, which activates the transcription of EVI1 in hematopoietic stem cells. Our aim was to characterize the functional promoter region of EVI1, and to identify transcription factors involved in the regulation of this gene. Generation of seven truncated constructs and luciferase reporter assays allowed us to determine a 318-bp region as the minimal promoter region of EVI1. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays identified RUNX1 and ELK1 as putative transcription factors of EVI1. Furthermore, knockdown of RUNX1 and ELK1 led to EVI1 downregulation, and their overexpression to upregulation of EVI1. Interestingly, in a series of patient samples with AML at diagnosis, we found a significant positive correlation between EVI1 and RUNX1 at protein level. Moreover, we identified one of the roles of RUNX1 in the activation of EVI1 during megakaryocytic differentiation. EVI1 knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of megakaryocytic markers after treating K562 cells with TPA, as happens when knocking down RUNX1. In conclusion, we define the minimal promoter region of EVI1 and demonstrate that RUNX1 and ELK1, two proteins with essential functions in hematopoiesis, regulate EVI1 in AML. Furthermore, our results show that one of the mechanisms by which RUNX1 regulates the transcription of EVI1 is by acetylation of the histone H3 on its promoter region. This study opens new directions to further understand the mechanisms of EVI1 overexpressing leukemias.","['Maicas, M', 'Vazquez, I', 'Vicente, C', 'Garcia-Sanchez, M A', 'Marcotegui, N', 'Urquiza, L', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Odero, M D']","['Maicas M', 'Vazquez I', 'Vicente C', 'Garcia-Sanchez MA', 'Marcotegui N', 'Urquiza L', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Odero MD']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Division of Oncology, CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012222 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.222 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Apr 18;32(16):2069-78. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.222.

We report an 88-year-old male patient with three simultaneous clonal disorders, that is, CD4+/CD8(weak) T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. The patient has only minimal complaints and has no anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly were not present. The three disorders were characterized by flow cytometry analysis, and the clonality of the T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, the patient has different B-cell clones, given that plasma cells of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance exhibited a kappa light-chain restriction population and, on the other hand, B-lymphocytes of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis exhibited a lambda light-chain restriction population. This finding does not support the antigen-driven hypothesis for the development of multi-compartment diseases, but suggests that T-cell large granular lymphocytic expansion might represent a direct antitumor immunological response to both B-cell and plasma-cell aberrant populations, as part of the immune surveillance against malignant neoplasms.","['Matos, Daniel Mazza', 'de Oliveira, Ana Cesarina Vitoriano', 'Tome, Maria de Nazare Amaral', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto']","['Matos DM', 'de Oliveira AC', 'Tome Mde N', 'Scrideli CA']","['Flow Cytometry Section, Laboratorio Clementino Fraga, Rua Carlos Vasconcelos, 957, Fortaleza, CE, 60115-170, Brazil. dmazza@lcf.com.br']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120612,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-012-0271-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Dec;29(5):3557-60. doi: 10.1007/s12032-012-0271-3.

WT1 was also found to be involved in tumor angiogenesis. There are no data concerning the involvement of WT1 in angiogenesis in lymphoproliferative tumors. The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of WT1 in Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: The expression of WT1, neuropilin 1, and VEGF was tested by immunohistochemistry in lymph nodes biopsies of 20 Hodgkin patients and 7 reactive lymph nodes. RESULTS: WT1 was expressed in endothelial cells, in 95% of the malignant lymph nodes. The average of WT1 expression scale was higher in the malignant lymph nodes than in reactive lymph nodes. We found a positive correlation between WT1 expression scale and the angiogenesis scale (0.53) that was statistically significant (P<0.05). As the number of vessels increases, the expression of WT1 is more intense. CONCLUSIONS: We found, for the first time, that WT1 is expressed in endothelial cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. The clinical implications of these findings should be tested in a future study.","['Vadasz, Zahava', 'Shasha-Lavsky, Hadas', 'Nov, Yuval', 'Bejar, Jacob', 'Lurie, Michael', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Attias, Dina']","['Vadasz Z', 'Shasha-Lavsky H', 'Nov Y', 'Bejar J', 'Lurie M', 'Tadmor T', 'Attias D']","['The Hematology Division, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. zahava.vadas@b-zion.org.il']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e318259852a [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2013 Mar;21(2):177-80. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e318259852a.,20130730,10.1097/PAI.0b013e318259852a [doi],,,"['0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/*blood supply/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Neuropilin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the outcomes associated with KIT mutations in AML1-ETO have not been elucidated. A 16-year-old boy was diagnosed with recurrent AML. Although he underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) twice, the leukemia relapsed and grew resistant to several chemotherapies. We began to treat him with imatinib, but stopped on the 31st day as it did not show any effects. Later, we administered dasatinib. However, we discontinued this because he showed severe nasal hemorrhage 87 days after administration of dasatinib. The therapeutic benefit of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) was estimated by quantitative analysis of AML1-ETO and the patient's clinical impression. We did not conduct analyses to determine the effective concentration of TKI. The patient has not yet shown any major molecular response.

The results of broncho-alveolar lavage suggested Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was increased, and steroid therapy was started. The symptoms transiently subsided, but exacerbated with a reduction in the steroid dose. On Day 139, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema appeared. We considered that non-infectious interstitial pneumonia was primarily involved in the pathogenesis for the following reasons: the boy was negative for beta-D-glucan early after onset, and there was a correlation between the steroid-dose reduction and condition. The steroid dose was again increased to 80 mg and the symptoms promptly subsided.

The clinical dilemma lies in how to treat one without precipitating the other. Our case demonstrates this important clinical problem. A 35-year-old lady with ES taking aspirin with clopidogrel for thrombo-prophylaxis presented with massive epistaxis. Blood tests showed polycythaemia, thrombocytopenia and normal clotting studies. A bone marrow biopsy ruled out leukaemia and normal imaging made pulmonary haemorrhage unlikely. Drug induced platelet dysfunction on a background of thrombocytopenia was the most likely cause of her epistaxis. Despite cessation of her dual anti-platelet therapy and multiple nasal packing, heavy epistaxis continued. She was given an infusion of platelets, and once her counts normalised, she was re-started on anti-platelet therapy.","['Liu, Alexander', 'Saman, Harman', 'Pusalkar, Pawan']","['Liu A', 'Saman H', 'Pusalkar P']","['Acute Admissions Unit, Watford General Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20110804,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,PMC4545113,2011/01/01 00:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr.02.2011.3812 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr.02.2011.3812 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2011 Aug 4;2011. pii: bcr.02.2011.3812. doi: 10.1136/bcr.02.2011.3812.,20130729,10.1136/bcr.02.2011.3812 [doi] bcr0220113812 [pii],,,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', 'A74586SNO7 (Clopidogrel)', 'OM90ZUW7M1 (Ticlopidine)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspirin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clopidogrel', 'Eisenmenger Complex/*complications', 'Epistaxis/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced', 'Thrombosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Ticlopidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We decided to verify whether pathological telomere erosion also arises in restored Philadelphia-negative (Ph-negative) hematopoiesis following successful treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Eighty-one CML patients in complete cytogenetic remission were compared to 76 age-matched healthy subjects. Myeloid cells of CML patients had shorter telomeres than controls (6521 bp vs 7233 bp, p<0.001). This difference was specific for the myeloid compartment, since it was not observed in lymphoid cells (6774 bp vs 6909 bp, p=0.620). Acquired Ph-negative cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.010), lack of complete molecular remission (p=0.016) and age (p=0.013) were independent predictors of telomere shortening. Telomere dynamics were assessed over a median follow-up period of 22 months. We documented accelerated non-physiological ongoing telomere shortening in 17/59 CML patients (28%). Patients experiencing grade 2-4 hematological toxicity, during CML remission possessed significantly shorter telomeres compared to those lacking toxicity (p=0.005 for any toxicity, p=0.007 for anemia). CML patients suffer from significant and often ongoing telomere stress resulting in premature and selective aging of the myeloid compartment which might have long-term consequences on function and integrity of Ph-negative hematopoiesis.","['Lobetti-Bodoni, Chiara', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Genuardi, Elisa', 'Passera, Roberto', 'Bernocco, Elisa', 'Sia, Daniela', 'Grignani, Giovanni', 'Crisa, Elena', 'Monitillo, Luigia', 'Rocci, Alberto', 'Drandi, Daniela', 'Giai, Valentina', 'Zanni, Manuela', 'Boi, Michela', 'Isaia, Gianluca', 'Barbero, Daniela', 'Lunghi, Monia', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Radaelli, Franca', 'Pini, Massimo', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Ladetto, Marco']","['Lobetti-Bodoni C', 'Ferrero D', 'Genuardi E', 'Passera R', 'Bernocco E', 'Sia D', 'Grignani G', 'Crisa E', 'Monitillo L', 'Rocci A', 'Drandi D', 'Giai V', 'Zanni M', 'Boi M', 'Isaia G', 'Barbero D', 'Lunghi M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Radaelli F', 'Pini M', 'Pregno P', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Gaidano G', 'Boccadoro M', 'Ladetto M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Turin, A.O.U.

We synthesized and structurally characterized the precursor molecule Cu(phen)(OH(2))(2)(OClO(3))(2), and determined the complex formation constants of [Cu(phen)(L)](2+). We studied the cytotoxic activity of [Cu(phen)(2)(L)](ClO(4))(2) versus human hematologic (CCRF-CEM and CCRF-SB) and solid tumor-derived cell lines (K-MES-1, DU-145). The cytotoxic activities, in the 1-3 muM range, show that our Cu(II)-complexes possess comparable inhibitory activities against both leukemia and carcinoma cells, unlike the majority of antineoplastic agents, usually more potent against hematologic cancer cells than against solid tumor cells. Because the free Cu(II) ion is reduced by glutathione (GSH), we studied the reactivity of our complexes with GSH, providing evidence that no redox reaction occurred under the chosen experimental conditions. Complex formation equilibria were present, studied by spectrophotometric titrations. The redox properties of the prepared compounds were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry, confirming that the mixed Cu(II) complexes were resistant to reduction.","['Pivetta, Tiziana', 'Isaia, Francesco', 'Verani, Gaetano', 'Cannas, Carla', 'Serra, Laura', 'Castellano, Carlo', 'Demartin, Francesco', 'Pilla, Federica', 'Manca, Matteo', 'Pani, Alessandra']","['Pivetta T', 'Isaia F', 'Verani G', 'Cannas C', 'Serra L', 'Castellano C', 'Demartin F', 'Pilla F', 'Manca M', 'Pani A']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, Universita degli Studi di Cagliari, 09042 Monserrato (CA), Italy. tpivetta@unica.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120504,United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0162-0134(12)00137-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2012.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2012 Sep;114:28-37. doi: 10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2012.04.017.

Patients with relapsed/refractory MCL represent a challenge for the treating physician stressing the need to develop therapeutic agents. Lenalidomide, a novel inmmunomodulatory drug (IMiD), is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. Biologically, the mechanisms responsible for lenalidomide activity are yet to be clearly defined. Based on pre-clinical models and early correlative studies conducted parallel to clinical trials, lenalidomide has been found to enhance NK-cell and T-cell activity against tumor cells, alter the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor bed, inhibit angiogenesis, and to a lesser degree, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Together, all these biological effects appear to play a role in the activity observed in lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide. Given the effect in NK- and T-cell function, lenalidomide is an alternative strategy to enhance the anti-tumor activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Clinical responses have been observed in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and MCL. The favorable toxicity profile and route of administration made the use of lenalidomide an attractive therapy for certain types of patients (i.e. elderly, chemotherapy unfit, etc.). The erratic but serious incidence of tumor lysis syndrome and/or tumor flare reactions provides challenges in the incorporation of lenalidomide in the management of previously untreated lymphoma patients with bulky adenopathy. Early studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of lenalidomide in combination with steroids or rituximab/bendamustine in MCL are promising and warrant further study. In addition, the evaluation of lenalidomide in the maintenance setting (i.e. post HDC-ASCT) or in combination with other target specific agents (i.e. proteasome inhibitors) in MCL is being addressed in ongoing clinical trials. We provide a general overview of the clinical development of lenalidomide in MCL. Future translational and clinical studies will further define the role of lenalidomide in the management of de novo or relapsed/refractory MCL and may assist in the identification of subset of MCL patients most likely to gain clinical benefit from this exiting agent.","['Dawar, Richa', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco']","['Dawar R', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri F']","['Medical Oncology and Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120518,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In the PA method, the agglutination reaction between the HTLV-1 antibody and sensitized particles occurred at a 1 : 128 dilution of some breast milk samples. The average antibody titer was one order of magnitude lower than that in the serum positive control. A total of 243 human breast milk specimens were assayed by PA, of which 21 samples from Okinawa, Hyogo, Miyagi and Hokkaido were positive or deferred. The results of the 21 positive samples were subsequently assayed by LIA (INNO-LIA HTLV I/II) for confirmation; and one sample was positive, and two were indeterminate. We attempted to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HTLV-1 provirus DNA, but we did not detect PCR products for the pX1 region of the HTLV-1 genome in the LIA-positive samples. These negative PCR results are most likely due to the lower sensitivity of the PCR for amplification from milk than from HTLV-1-positive monocytes. In conclusion, the PA method to breast milk samples appears to be a suitable tool to screen for antibodies to HTLV-1 in the breast milk of carrier mothers in cases in which it would be difficult to use serum for the test. Although LIA may be able to confirm HTLV-1 infection, the presence of HTLV-1 provirus should be confirmed in the breast milk.","['Matsubara, Futoshi', 'Haraguchi, Koichi', 'Harada, Kouji', 'Koizumi, Akio']","['Matsubara F', 'Haraguchi K', 'Harada K', 'Koizumi A']","['Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry, Daiichi College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan. matsubara@daiichi-cps.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/35.773 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.35.773 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2012;35(5):773-6. doi: 10.1248/bpb.35.773.,20121015,,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Agglutination Tests/*methods', 'Carrier State/*immunology', '*DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/methods', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Japan', 'Milk, Human/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS OF THE STUDY: The present study was to investigate the possible anti-proliferative activity of ethanolic extract and the organic fractions from P. commune on murine leukemia L1210 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The content of ethanolic extract and its fractions was performed on HPLC analysis with gradient elution. L1210 cells were treated with different concentrations of ethanolic extract and its fractions at different time intervals. Cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay. Apoptotic cell death was monitored by nuclear condensation and confirmed by exposure of phosphatidylserine to outer leaflet of plasma membrane. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by flow cytometry using rhodamine 123 staining. RESULTS: The obtained results showed that the cell viability of L1210 cells was reduced by ethanolic extract of P. commune in a concentration-dependent manner, and the IC(50) value was about 77.22 mug/ml at 24h post treatment. The ethylacetate fraction displayed higher anti-tumor effect than that of chloroform and butanol fractions with 32.29 mug/ml (IC(50) value, 48 h). Microscopy studies revealed that ethanolic extract and ethylacetate fraction treated cells showed morphological characteristics of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and DNA aggregation. Further, Annexin V-PE/ 7-AAD double staining showing the out leaflet of phosphatidylserine and the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry confirmed that the extracts do, in fact, induce apoptosis in L1210 cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on anti-tumor and pro-apoptotic effect of P. commune in cultured leukemia cells, which provides scientific basis for its usefulness as traditional medicine. Further studies are needed to confirm the precise mechanism not only the crude extract but as well the monomeric chemical substances of Polytrichum commune L.ex Hedw.","['Cheng, Xiaoxia', 'Xiao, Yaping', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Wang, Pan', 'Li, Hongxia', 'Yan, Han', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Cheng X', 'Xiao Y', 'Wang X', 'Wang P', 'Li H', 'Yan H', 'Liu Q']","['Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120609,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(12)00376-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.054 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2012 Aug 30;143(1):49-56. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.054.

The molecular etiology of XMRV infection has not been characterized and its implication in human prostate cancer progression remains equivocal. As a step toward resolving this issue we developed an in vitro enzymatic assay system to characterize XMRV protease (PR)-mediated cleavage of host-cell proteins. Enzymatically-active XMRV PR protein was synthesized using a wheat-germ cell-free system. By monitoring cleavage activity of XMRV PR by AlphaScreen and 2-color immunoblot analyses, we revealed that the catalytic activity of XMRV PR is selectively blocked by the HIV PR inhibitor, Amprenavir, and identified several human tumor suppressor proteins, including PTEN and BAX, to be substrates of XMRV PR. This system may provide an attractive means for analyzing the function of retrovirus proteases and provide a technology platform for drug screening.","['Matsunaga, Satoko', 'Sawasaki, Tatsuya', 'Ode, Hirotaka', 'Morishita, Ryo', 'Furukawa, Ayako', 'Sakuma, Ryuta', 'Sugiura, Wataru', 'Sato, Hironori', 'Katahira, Masato', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Ryo, Akihide']","['Matsunaga S', 'Sawasaki T', 'Ode H', 'Morishita R', 'Furukawa A', 'Sakuma R', 'Sugiura W', 'Sato H', 'Katahira M', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Yamamoto N', 'Ryo A']","['Department of Microbiology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120609,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(12)00424-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2012.05.047 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2012 Aug 3;75(15):4863-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.05.047.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva samples were obtained from 115 children without cancer (control) and 32 children with cancer (CA). Children with cancer were also evaluated after antineoplasic treatment (CAT, n = 17). The salivary concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), levothyroxine (T4), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were determined. RESULTS: Acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma were the most frequent cancers, although cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, osteosarcoma, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and endodermal sinus tumor were also observed. The salivary concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides, or GGT did not differ between groups. Instead, the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and T4 were higher in patients with cancer, irrespective of treatment. TSH levels were higher in the CA group and urea concentration was lower in the CAT group. T3 was undetectable in all groups. Antineoplasic treatment increased the glucose level and decreased the insulin concentration. Salivary concentration of total IgA was lower in children with cancer, irrespective of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer and antineoplasic treatment affected biochemical and immunological parameters in the saliva of children, shedding new light on the potential usefulness of saliva for monitoring children with cancer, especially to patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.","['Guerra, Rosane N M', 'Oliveira-Junior, Joao J', 'Mouchrek-Filho, Jose Carlos E', 'Liberio, Silvana A', 'Lima, Monica V V', 'Paim, Deborah B S', 'Brito, Carolina X L', 'Mendonca, Cristina', 'Nascimento, Flavia Raquel F', 'Pereira, Antonio Luiz A']","['Guerra RN', 'Oliveira-Junior JJ', 'Mouchrek-Filho JC', 'Liberio SA', 'Lima MV', 'Paim DB', 'Brito CX', 'Mendonca C', 'Nascimento FR', 'Pereira AL']","['Laboratory of Immunophysiology, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas e da Saude, Universidade Federal do Maranhao, Maranhao, Brazil. rnmguerra@pq.cnpq.br']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120612,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01165.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2012 Aug;41(7):527-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01165.x.

Therefore, there is a need for novel targeted and less toxic therapies, particularly for patients who develop resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. The liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway has recently emerged as a tumor suppressor axis. A critical point is that the LKB1/AMPK network remains functional in a wide range of cancers and could be stimulated by drugs, such as N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide (metformin) or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR). AREAS COVERED: The literature data show that drugs activating LKB1/AMPK signaling induced cell cycle arrest, caspase-dependent apoptosis or autophagy in hematopoietic tumors. Moreover, metformin effectively inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-controlled oncogenetic protein translation, which does not occur with allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its derivatives. Metformin was also capable of targeting leukemic stem cells, the most relevant target for leukemia eradication. EXPERT OPINION: Data emerging from preclinical settings suggest that the LKB1/AMPK pathway is critically involved in regulating proliferation and survival of malignant hematopoietic cells. Thus, it is proposed that drugs activating the LKB1/AMPK axis may offer a novel and less toxic treatment option for some types of hematological malignancies.","['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Ognibene, Andrea', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Martelli AM', 'Chiarini F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Ognibene A', 'Bressanin D', 'Billi AM', 'Manzoli L', 'Cappellini A', 'McCubrey JA']","['University of Bologna, Human Anatomy, via Irnerio 48, Bologna, 40126, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120612,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2012.694869 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2012 Jul;16(7):729-42. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2012.694869.

Since they combine mechanical stability and protein functionality, IBs have been already exploited in biocatalysis and explored for bottom-up topographical modification in tissue engineering. Being fully biocompatible and with tuneable bio-physical properties, IBs are currently emerging as agents for protein delivery into mammalian cells in protein-replacement cell therapies. So far, IBs formed by chaperones (heat shock protein 70, Hsp70), enzymes (catalase and dihydrofolate reductase), grow factors (leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF) and structural proteins (the cytoskeleton keratin 14) have been shown to rescue exposed cells from a spectrum of stresses and restore cell functions in absence of cytotoxicity. The natural penetrability of IBs into mammalian cells (reaching both cytoplasm and nucleus) empowers them as an unexpected platform for the controlled delivery of essentially any therapeutic polypeptide. Production of protein drugs by biopharma has been traditionally challenged by IB formation. However, a time might have arrived in which recombinant bacteria are to be engineered for the controlled packaging of therapeutic proteins as nanoparticulate materials (nanopills), for their extra- or intra-cellular release in medicine and cosmetics.","['Villaverde, Antonio', 'Garcia-Fruitos, Elena', 'Rinas, Ursula', 'Seras-Franzoso, Joaquin', 'Kosoy, Ana', 'Corchero, Jose Luis', 'Vazquez, Esther']","['Villaverde A', 'Garcia-Fruitos E', 'Rinas U', 'Seras-Franzoso J', 'Kosoy A', 'Corchero JL', 'Vazquez E']","['Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain. antoni.villaverde@uab.cat']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120611,England,Microb Cell Fact,Microbial cell factories,101139812,PMC3538617,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1475-2859-11-76 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2859-11-76 [doi]']",epublish,Microb Cell Fact. 2012 Jun 11;11:76. doi: 10.1186/1475-2859-11-76.,20130423,10.1186/1475-2859-11-76 [doi],,,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Keratin-14)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Bacteria/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Keratin-14/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially due to the success of microarray and, more recently, sequencing technology. Apart from understanding mechanisms of disease pathogenesis on a molecular basis, for example in cancer research, the challenge of analyzing such different data types in an integrated way has become increasingly important also for the validation of new sequencing technologies with maximum resolution. For this purpose, a methodological framework for their comparison with microarray techniques in the context of smallest sample sizes, which result from the high costs of experiments, is proposed in this contribution. Based on an adaptation of the externally centered correlation coefficient ( Schafer et al. 2009 ), it is demonstrated how a Bayesian mixture model can be applied to compare and classify measurements of histone acetylation that stem from chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with either microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing techniques (ChIP-seq) for the identification of DNA fragments. Here, the murine hematopoietic cell line 32D, which was transduced with the oncogene BCR-ABL, the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia, was characterized. Cells were compared to mock-transduced cells as control. Activation or inhibition of other genes by histone modifications induced by the oncogene is considered critical in such a context for the understanding of the disease.","['Schafer, Martin', 'Lkhagvasuren, Otgonzul', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Elling, Christian', 'Wustefeld, Torsten', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Zender, Lars', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Ickstadt, Katja']","['Schafer M', 'Lkhagvasuren O', 'Klein HU', 'Elling C', 'Wustefeld T', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Zender L', 'Koschmieder S', 'Dugas M', 'Ickstadt K']","['Department of Statistics, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany. martin.schaefer@tu-dortmund.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of neutrophil apoptosis. We determined the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic Bak and anti-aptototic Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 members of the Bcl-2 family in unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with mild to moderate COPD and compared these to neutrophils from healthy controls. METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood samples of 47 COPD patients (smokers: N = 24) and 47 healthy controls (smokers: N = 24). Percentages of apoptotic cells were determined at 4, 24, and 36 h for unstimulated neutrophils cultured in vitro. Neutrophil mRNA expression of Bak, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FEV1 (% predicted) and FVC were determined by spirometry and correlations between mRNA levels and lung function parameters were determined. RESULTS: The percentages of apoptotic cells among unstimulated neutrophils from COPD patients were significantly lower compared to cells from controls after 4, 24, and 36 h in culture; smoking history had only a minimal effect on these differences. Unstimulated neutrophils from COPD patients had significantly lower Bak mRNA expression and higher expressions of Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA than cells from healthy controls. Again, smoking history had only a minimal effect on these trends. Bak mRNA expression was significantly positively correlated with both % predicted FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, while Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA expressions were significantly negatively correlated with %predicted FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The genes for pro-apoptotic Bak, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 may be important in regulating the delayed neutrophil apoptosis observed in COPD, which may contribute to COPD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most frequent and significant problems encountered by nurses practice across the world. The Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire was widely translated and used to assess the pain experience of several types of patients because it combines the properties of the standard McGill Pain Questionnaire but takes substantially less time to administer. DESIGN: The study used psychometric testing to establish reliability and validity of the Turkish version of Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. METHODS: A convenience sample of 160 patients with leukaemia in Turkey was used to collect data regarding pain evaluation. The original version of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, adapted into Turkish, was tested for internal consistency, content validity, construct validity and concurrent validity. RESULTS: Internal consistency was found adequate at both assessments with Cronbach's alpha 0.88 for test and 0.91 for retest. For reliability of the total, sensory, affective and evaluative total pain intensity, high intraclass correlations were demonstrated (0.85, 0.84, 0.82 and 0.70, respectively). Correlation of total, sensory and affective score with the numerical rating scale was tested for construct validity demonstrating r = 0.61 (p < 0.01) for test and r = 0.68 (p < 0.01) for retest. Correlation with blood pressure values for concurrent validity was found to be r = 0.78 (p < 0.001) for test and r = 0.73 (p < 0.001) for retest. CONCLUSION: Turkish version of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire has shown statistically acceptable levels of reliability and validity for pain evaluation in patients with leukaemia. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provided evidence that the Turkish version of the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing pain. This scale can be used to assess nursing interventions aimed at decreasing pain and efficacy of the treatment.","['Bicici, Berna', 'Gunes, Ulku Yapucu']","['Bicici B', 'Gunes UY']","['Department of Fundamentals of Nursing, Ege University Faculty of Nursing, Bornova-Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20120612,England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,,2012/06/13 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04107.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2012 Dec;21(23-24):3328-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04107.x.

We describe here the clinical, morphological, immunological, cytogenetic and molecular findings from 37 cases of t(14;18)-positive CLPD, identified from our series of non-FL B-cell neoplasms (n=993) that were routinely analysed in peripheral blood by conventional cytogenetics analyses. The FL diagnosis was excluded by morphology and immunology (the samples were CD10 negative in all cases). The BCL2 translocations were observed in 22 CLL cases, including 7 monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) cases re-classified according to the new International Workshop on CLL criteria, six small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cases, 1 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) case and eight cases of unclassifiable CLPD with overlapping CLL/MZL features. In the CLL cases, the IGH/BCL2 fusion was remarkably associated with trisomy 12 (13/22) and mutated IGHV status (20/21) and did not affect the outcome. Moreover, most of these CLLs harboured a low mutation load of BCL6 gene and unmutated FAS (CD95) loci, which points to a post-germinal-centre cellular origin.","['Baseggio, Lucile', 'Geay, Marie-Odile', 'Gazzo, Sophie', 'Berger, Francoise', 'Traverse-Glehen, Alexandra', 'Ffrench, Martine', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Verney, Aurelie', 'Morel, Dominique', 'Jallades, Laurent', 'Magaud, Jean-Pierre', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Felman, Pascale']","['Baseggio L', 'Geay MO', 'Gazzo S', 'Berger F', 'Traverse-Glehen A', 'Ffrench M', 'Hayette S', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Verney A', 'Morel D', 'Jallades L', 'Magaud JP', 'Salles G', 'Felman P']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, UMR5239 Pathologies des cellules lymphoides, Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120612,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/06/13 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09178.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Aug;158(4):489-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09178.x.

It is within this context that immunotherapy has gained attention in recent years. In this review, we focus on the use of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines for immunotherapy of AML. DC are central orchestrators of the immune system, bridging innate and adaptive immunity and critical to the induction of anti-leukemic immunity.

Here we determined that wolfberry phytochemicals was chemopreventive on the leukemic Jurkat cell. The water soluble wolfberry fractions (i.e., wolfberry phytochemicals) were enriched in carbohydrates (73.4 +/- 4.5 % (w/w)), polyphenolics (1555 +/- 112 mg quercetin equivalent/100 g freeze dry powder, including 213 mg rutin/100 g freeze dry powder), and had enhanced antioxidant activity (7771 +/- 207 muM Trolox equivalent/100 g freeze dry powder). Wolfberry phytochemicals, but not purified wolfberry polysaccharide fractions, inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation, induced cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in a dose dependent manner starting at 1 mg/ml for 48 h. Wolfberry phytochemicals eliminated cellular reactive oxygen species, declined expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress biomarkers, including glucose regulated protein 78, inositol-requiring protein 1(IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and c/EBP-homologous protein, and induced activation of AMP activated protein kinase, stabilization of beta-catenin, and inhibition of NFkappaB, and AKT activity. Simultaneous siRNA knockdown of ATF6, IRE1 and PERK caused inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Data suggested that ER stress and multiple survival/apoptosis signaling pathways were modulated by wolfberry phytochemicals during the apoptotic progression. Consumption of wolfberry could be an efficacious dietary strategy for preventing leukemia.","['Jiang, Yu', 'Zhang, Yunong', 'Wark, Logan', 'Ortiz, Edlin', 'Lim, Soyoung', 'He, Hui', 'Wang, Weiqun', 'Medeiros, Denis', 'Lin, Dingbo']","['Jiang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Wark L', 'Ortiz E', 'Lim S', 'He H', 'Wang W', 'Medeiros D', 'Lin D']","['Department of Human Nutrition, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR017686/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017686-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,J Nutr Food Sci,Journal of nutrition & food sciences,101583310,PMC3368523,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/06/12 06:01,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Nutr Food Sci. 2011 Nov 24;S2.,,001 [pii],,,,,,['NIHMS371720'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have implicated the human aldo-ketoreductases AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in cancer, and therefore we examined AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 expression across all major human cancer types using the Oncomine cancer gene expression database (Compendia Biosciences, www.oncomine.com). Using this database, we found that expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 varies greatly by cancer type and tissue of origin, including agreement with previous reports that AKR1B10 is significantly over-expressed in cancers of the lungs and liver. AKR1B1 is more broadly over-expressed in human cancers than AKR1B10, albeit at a generally lower magnitude. AKR1B1 over-expression was found to be associated with shortened patient survival in acute myelogenous leukemias and multiple myelomas. High AKR1B10 expression tends to predict less aggressive clinical course generally, notably within lung cancers, where it tends to be highly over-expressed compared to normal tissue. These findings suggest that AKR1B1 inhibitors in particular hold great potential as novel cancer therapeutics.","['Laffin, Brian', 'Petrash, J Mark']","['Laffin B', 'Petrash JM']","['Department of Ophthalmology, The School of Medicine, University of Colorado Aurora, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 EY005856/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY021498/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20120606,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC3368246,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/06/12 06:01,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2012.00104 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2012 Jun 6;3:104. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2012.00104. eCollection 2012.,20121002,10.3389/fphar.2012.00104 [doi],['NOTNLM'],"['AKR1B1', 'AKR1B10', 'HSIR', 'aldose reductase', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'meta-analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like all herpesviruses, the VZV DNA genome is replicated in the nucleus and packaged into nucleocapsids that must egress across the nuclear membrane for incorporation into virus particles in the cytoplasm. Our recent work showed that VZV nucleocapsids are sequestered in nuclear cages formed from promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vitro and in human dorsal root ganglia and skin xenografts in vivo. We sought a method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of nucleocapsids in the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells as well as the 3D shape, volume and ultrastructure of these unique PML subnuclear domains. Here we report the development of a novel 3D imaging and reconstruction strategy that we term Serial Section Array-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SSA-SEM) and its application to the analysis of VZV-infected cells and these nuclear PML cages. We show that SSA-SEM permits large volume imaging and 3D reconstruction at a resolution sufficient to localize, count and distinguish different types of VZV nucleocapsids and to visualize complete PML cages. This method allowed a quantitative determination of how many nucleocapsids can be sequestered within individual PML cages (sequestration capacity), what proportion of nucleocapsids are entrapped in single nuclei (sequestration efficiency) and revealed the ultrastructural detail of the PML cages. More than 98% of all nucleocapsids in reconstructed nuclear volumes were contained in PML cages and single PML cages sequestered up to 2,780 nucleocapsids, which were shown by electron tomography to be embedded and cross-linked by an filamentous electron-dense meshwork within these unique subnuclear domains. This SSA-SEM analysis extends our recent characterization of PML cages and provides a proof of concept for this new strategy to investigate events during virion assembly at the single cell level.","['Reichelt, Mike', 'Joubert, Lydia', 'Perrino, John', 'Koh, Ai Leen', 'Phanwar, Ibanri', 'Arvin, Ann M']","['Reichelt M', 'Joubert L', 'Perrino J', 'Koh AL', 'Phanwar I', 'Arvin AM']","['Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America. reichelt@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['AI20459/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI020459/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI020459/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053846/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053846/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,PMC3369938,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/11/10 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002740 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-00133 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(6):e1002740. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002740.

The original ultra-IHC was the ImmunoMax method or the catalyzed signal amplification system (ImmunoMax/CSA method), comprising the streptavidin-biotin complex (sABC) method and catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) reaction with visualization of its deposition. By introducing procedures to diminish non-specific staining in the original ultra-IHC method, we developed the modified ImmunoMax/CSA method with AR heating sections in an AR solution (heating-AR). The heating-AR and modified ImmunoMax/CSA method visualized expression of the predominantly simple present form of HTLV-1 proviral DNA pX region p40Tax protein (Tax) in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells in archival pathology specimens in approximately 75% of cases. The simple present form of Tax detected exhibited a close relation with ATLL cell proliferation. We also established a new simplified CSA (nsCSA) system by replacing the sABC method with the secondary antibody- and horse radish peroxidase-labeled polymer reagent method, introducing the pretreatments blocking non-specific binding of secondary antibody reagent, and diminishing the diffusion of deposition in the CARD reaction. Combined with AR treating sections with proteinase K solution (enzymatic-AR), the nsCSA system visualized granular immunostaining of the complex present form of Tax in a small number of ATLL cells in most cases, presenting the possibility of etiological pathological diagnosis of ATLL and suggesting that the complex present form of Tax-positive ATLL cells were young cells derived from ATLL stem cells. The heating-AR and ultra-IHC detected physiological expression of the p53 protein and its probable phosphorylation by Tax in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of peripheral blood tissue specimens from HTLV-1 carriers, as well as physiological and pathological expression of the molecules involved with G1 phase progression and G1-S phase transition (E2F-1, E2F-4, DP-1, and cyclin E) in ATLL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma cells. The ultra-IHC with AR is useful for etiological pathological diagnosis of ATLL since HTLV-1 pathogenicity depends on that of Tax, and can be a useful tool for studies translating advanced molecular biology and pathology to human pathology.","['Hasui, Kazuhisa', 'Wang, Jia', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Izumo, Shuji', 'Eizuru, Yoshito', 'Matsuyama, Takami']","['Hasui K', 'Wang J', 'Tanaka Y', 'Izumo S', 'Eizuru Y', 'Matsuyama T']","['Division of Immunology, Department of Infection and Immunity, Institute Research Center (Health Research Course), Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120421,Japan,Acta Histochem Cytochem,Acta histochemica et cytochemica,0147110,PMC3365307,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/06/12 06:01,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1267/ahc.11034 [doi]', 'AHC11034 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Histochem Cytochem. 2012 Apr 26;45(2):83-106. doi: 10.1267/ahc.11034.

CRLF2 encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor, which activates cell signaling in normal lymphocytes on binding its ligand, TSLP. We hypothesized that aberrant cell signaling occurs in CRLF2-rearranged ALL and can be targeted by signal transduction inhibitors of this pathway. In a large number of primary CRLF2-rearranged ALL samples, we observed increased basal levels of pJAK2, pSTAT5, and pS6. We thus characterized the biochemical sequelae of CRLF2 and JAK alterations in CRLF2-rearranged ALL primary patient samples via analysis of TSLP-mediated signal transduction. TSLP stimulation of these leukemias further induced robust JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. JAK inhibition abrogated phosphorylation of JAK/STAT and, surprisingly, of PI3K/mTOR pathway members, suggesting an interconnection between these signaling networks and providing a rationale for testing JAK inhibitors in clinical trials. The PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors rapamycin, PI103, and PP242 also inhibited activated signal transduction and translational machinery proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, suggesting that signal transduction inhibitors targeting this pathway also may have therapeutic relevance for patients with CRLF2-rearranged ALL and merit further preclinical testing.","['Tasian, Sarah K', 'Doral, Michelle Y', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Loh, Mignon L']","['Tasian SK', 'Doral MY', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Chen IM', 'Harvey RC', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Willman CL', 'Hunger SP', 'Mullighan CG', 'Loh ML']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California-San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['K12CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HD044331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD044331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA157937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 CA142226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1T32CA128583,/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5RC2 CA14852902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120608,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3412346,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46582-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-389932 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):833-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-389932.

Bortezomib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome. Paradoxically, we find that bortezomib induces proteasome-independent degradation of the TRAF6 protein, but not mRNA, in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary cells. The reduction in TRAF6 protein coincides with bortezomib-induced autophagy, and subsequently with apoptosis in MDS/AML cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of TRAF6 sensitized bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, underscoring the importance of TRAF6 in bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity. Bortezomib-resistant cells expressing an shRNA targeting TRAF6 were resensitized to the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib due to down-regulation of the proteasomal subunit alpha-1 (PSMA1). To determine the molecular consequences of loss of TRAF6 in MDS/AML cells, in the present study, we applied gene-expression profiling and identified an apoptosis gene signature. Knockdown of TRAF6 in MDS/AML cell lines or patient samples resulted in rapid apoptosis and impaired malignant hematopoietic stem/progenitor function.

Correct diagnosis relies upon confirmation by immunophenotyping of the lineage conversion and certification that the same cytogenetic/molecular alterations remain despite the phenotypic changes. From a total of 1,482 AL pediatric patients, we report nine cases of lineage conversion (0.6%), seven from lymphoid (four Pro-B, two Pre-B, one Common) to myelo-monocytic, and two from myeloid (bilineal, with myeloid predominance) to Pro-B. Eight patients were infants. Switches were suggested by morphology and confirmed with a median of 15 days (range: 8 days-6 months) from initiation of therapy. Of note, in five cases switches occurred before day 15. Stability of the clonal abnormalities was assessed by cytogenetic, RT-PCR/Ig-TCR rearrangement studies in all patients. Abnormalities in 11q23/MLL gene were detected in seven cases. Treatment schedules were ALL (two pts), Interfant-99 (five pts) and AML (two pts) protocols.

The P2X receptors are nonselective cation channels that are widely expressed on excitable cells including neurons, glia, and smooth muscle cells. The protocols in this unit are useful for evaluating ligands that interact with P2X receptors on native cells or that are cloned and expressed in recombinant heterologous cell systems. Calcium imaging methods are described for the pharmacological characterization of fast or slowly desensitizing P2X receptors. While these methods are readily applicable to a wide variety of ligand-gated ion channels, the protocols provided herein detail how they can be used to measure activation of homomeric P2X3 (fast desensitizing) and heteromeric P2X2/3 (slowly desensitizing) receptors. Appropriate agonists and/or calcium dyes can be substituted to assess activity at other P2X receptor subtypes. An additional protocol is provided for measuring P2X7 receptor-mediated pore formation in THP-1, a native human acute monocytic leukemia cell line that can be used to study homomeric P2X7 (non-desensitizing) receptors that are expressed on macrophages and microglial cells.","['Namovic, Marian T', 'Jarvis, Michael F', 'Donnelly-Roberts, Diana']","['Namovic MT', 'Jarvis MF', 'Donnelly-Roberts D']","['Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Protoc Pharmacol,Current protocols in pharmacology,9717249,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/0471141755.ph0915s57 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protoc Pharmacol. 2012 Jun;Chapter 9:Unit 9.15.. doi: 10.1002/0471141755.ph0915s57.,20120828,10.1002/0471141755.ph0915s57 [doi],,,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Purinergic P2X Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Astrocytoma/metabolism', 'Buffers', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Fluorometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/pharmacology', 'Purinergic P2X Receptor Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,"['(c) 2012 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise surviving mechanisms of LSCs remain obscure. Cellular senescence is an important obstacle for production and surviving of tumor cells. In this study we investigated the activated state of a pathway, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces cellular senescence through DNA damage and phophorylation of p38 MAPK (p38), in myeloid leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Bone marrow samples were obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=11) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n=9). CD34(+)CD38(-) cells were isolated from mononuclear cells from these bone marrow samples, and K562 and KG1a cells (two kinds of myeloid leukemia cell lines) by mini-magnetic activated cell sorting. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human cord blood served as controls. Intracellular ROS level was detected by flow cytometry. DNA damage defined as the gammaH2AX level was measured by immunofluorescence staining. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of p21, a senescence-associated gene. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the p38 expression and activation. The proliferation and apoptosis of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Our results showed that ROS and DNA damage were substantially accumulated and p38 was less phosphorated in myeloid leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells as compared with HSCs and H(2)O(2)-induced senescent HSCs. Furthermore, over-phosphorylation of p38 by anisomycin, a selective activator of p38, induced both the senescence-like growth arrest and apoptosis of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from K562 and KG1a cell lines. These findings suggested that, although excessive accumulation of oxidative DNA damage was present in LSCs, the relatively decreased phosphorylation of p38 might help leukemic cells escape senescence and apoptosis.","['Xiao, Yin', 'Zou, Ping', 'Wang, Jie', 'Song, Hui', 'Zou, Jing', 'Liu, Lingbo']","['Xiao Y', 'Zou P', 'Wang J', 'Song H', 'Zou J', 'Liu L']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. zouping387@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. liulingbo64@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120609,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Most of these drugs target the ATP-binding pocket and stabilize the active conformation of the JAK kinases. This type I binding mode can lead to an increase in JAK activation loop phosphorylation, despite blockade of kinase function. Here we report that stabilizing the inactive state via type II inhibition acts in the opposite manner, leading to a loss of activation loop phosphorylation. We used X-ray crystallography to corroborate the binding mode and report for the first time the crystal structure of the JAK2 kinase domain in an inactive conformation. Importantly, JAK inhibitor-induced activation loop phosphorylation requires receptor interaction, as well as intact kinase and pseudokinase domains. Hence, depending on the respective conformation stabilized by a JAK inhibitor, hyperphosphorylation of the activation loop may or may not be elicited.","['Andraos, Rita', 'Qian, Zhiyan', 'Bonenfant, Debora', 'Rubert, Joelle', 'Vangrevelinghe, Eric', 'Scheufler, Clemens', 'Marque, Fanny', 'Regnier, Catherine H', 'De Pover, Alain', 'Ryckelynck, Hugues', 'Bhagwat, Neha', 'Koppikar, Priya', 'Goel, Aviva', 'Wyder, Lorenza', 'Tavares, Gisele', 'Baffert, Fabienne', 'Pissot-Soldermann, Carole', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Gaul, Christoph', 'Voshol, Hans', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Sellers, William R', 'Hofmann, Francesco', 'Radimerski, Thomas']","['Andraos R', 'Qian Z', 'Bonenfant D', 'Rubert J', 'Vangrevelinghe E', 'Scheufler C', 'Marque F', 'Regnier CH', 'De Pover A', 'Ryckelynck H', 'Bhagwat N', 'Koppikar P', 'Goel A', 'Wyder L', 'Tavares G', 'Baffert F', 'Pissot-Soldermann C', 'Manley PW', 'Gaul C', 'Voshol H', 'Levine RL', 'Sellers WR', 'Hofmann F', 'Radimerski T']","['Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['R01 CA151949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120503,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,PMC5022112,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0324 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2012 Jun;2(6):512-523. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0324.

We also showed that SP-B-induced cytotoxicity depended on induction of apoptosis that was mediated by p21waf1/cip1 expression. In the present study, we generated and characterized a stable, SP-B-resistant NALM-6 cell line (NALM-6/SP-B) by continuous exposure to SP-B, starting with a low SP-B concentration. NALM-6/SP-B cells were also more resistant to FK228, which has a similar chemical structure to SP-B, and were slightly more resistant to the P-gp substrates doxorubicin and vincristine than parental cells, but displayed similar susceptibility to other HDAC inhibitors and to paclitaxel as the parental cells. There was little change in the basal mRNA expression of HDAC1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2, Fas, caspase-3, c-Myc and MDR1 in NALM-6/SP-B compared to parental cells, but the mRNA expression of p21waf1/cip1 was decreased. The introduction of an exogenous p21waf1/cip1 expression vector restored SP-B induction of NALM-6/SP-B cell apoptosis. Moreover, overexpressed p21waf1/cip1 enhanced SP-B induction of the apoptosis of the human erythroleukemia leukemia cell line K562 which is less susceptible to SP-B than NALM-6 cells. These results suggest that downregulation of p21waf1/cip1, which is a characteristic feature of NALM-6/SP-B cells, was important for their resistance to SP-B, and that this SP-B resistance could be overcome by the introduction of exogenous p21waf1/cip1. Furthermore, introduction of p21waf1/cip1 to other leukemia cells such as K562 may enhance their susceptibility to SP-B. This is the first report of the characterization of SP-B-resistant cells and of the effect of overexpressed p21waf1/cip1 on the resistance or susceptibility of human leukemia cells to SP-B.","['Kanno, Syu-Ichi', 'Maeda, Naoyuki', 'Tomizawa, Ayako', 'Yomogida, Shin', 'Katoh, Tadashi', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Maeda N', 'Tomizawa A', 'Yomogida S', 'Katoh T', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Aoba-ku, Sendai 981-8558, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120606,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,PMC3582725,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/01/24 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1507 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Sep;41(3):862-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1507.

With the integrative procedure presented, cytology offers an excellent cost-effective tool for the diagnostic approach of patients with suspected hematopathological malignancies allowing a high diagnostic accuracy, ideal for initial diagnosis or follow-up.","['Bode, B', 'Tinguely, M']","['Bode B', 'Tinguely M']","['Institut fur Klinische Pathologie, Universtitatsspital Zurich, Schmelzbergstr. 12, 8091, Zurich, Schweiz. beata.bode@usz.ch']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00292-012-1580-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2012 Jul;33(4):316-23. doi: 10.1007/s00292-012-1580-1.,20121228,10.1007/s00292-012-1580-1 [doi],,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle/instrumentation/methods', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Cytological Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Equipment Design', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Image-Guided Biopsy/instrumentation/methods', 'Immunohistochemistry/instrumentation/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional/instrumentation/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,Rolle der Zytologie in der hamatopathologischen Diagnostik.,,,,,

Changes in FLT3 mutation status can occur during the course of disease, but the clinical impact of a change is unclear. We retrospectively reviewed 3555 acute myeloid leukemia patients, who have been assessed for FLT3 mutation at our institution between May 2002 and January 2011. We found that 42 (6.2%) out of 680 patients with FLT3 mutation experienced a change of FLT3 mutation status. In all, 36 patients with wild-type FLT3 at the time of initial diagnosis gained mutation (Negative/Positive) and six initially FLT3-mutated patients became wild type during their following relapses (Positive/Negative). The 5-year survival of these patients was similar to that of patients with persistently wild-type FLT3 (Negative/Negative; P=0.464), and significantly better than patients who had stable FLT3 mutation during their disease course (Positive/Positive; P<0.001). However, after mutations became detectable in the Negative/Positive group, the forward survival of these patients tracked that of the Positive/Positive group after relapse (P=0.761). In addition, we did not find a significant difference in survival between patients with internal tandem duplications and those with point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the FLT3 gene. These results suggest that FLT3 mutations are unstable and that there is potential clinical value in continuously monitoring FLT3 mutation status.","['Warren, Mikako', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Zuo, Zhuang']","['Warren M', 'Luthra R', 'Yin CC', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Zuo Z']","[""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor Collage of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120608,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol201288 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2012 Oct;25(10):1405-12. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.88.

To investigate the effects of mechanical strain on mouse ES cell fate, we examined the expression of Nanog, which is an essential regulator of self-renewal and pluripotency as well as Nanog-associated intracellular signaling during uniaxial cyclic mechanical strain. The mouse ES cell line, CCE was plated onto elastic membranes, and we applied 10% strain at 0.17 Hz. The expression of Nanog was reduced during ES cell differentiation in response to the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); however, two days of cyclic mechanical strain attenuated this reduction of Nanog expression. On the other hand, the cyclic mechanical strain promoted PI3K-Akt signaling, which is reported as an upstream of Nanog transcription. The cyclic mechanical strain-induced Akt phosphorylation was blunted by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, also inhibited the mechanical strain-induced increase in phospho-Akt. These findings imply that mechanical force plays a role in regulating Nanog expression in ES cells through the actin cytoskeleton-PI3K-Akt signaling.","['Horiuchi, Rie', 'Akimoto, Takayuki', 'Hong, Zhang', 'Ushida, Takashi']","['Horiuchi R', 'Akimoto T', 'Hong Z', 'Ushida T']","['Division of Regenerative Medical Engineering, Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(12)00269-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.05.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2012 Aug 15;318(14):1726-32. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.05.021.

Functional genomics approaches offer a means to discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this receptor. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the design of additional strategies to block adaptive cellular responses that drive compensatory ligand expression as an essential component of the targeted inhibition of oncogenic receptors in human cancers.","['Kentsis, Alex', 'Reed, Casie', 'Rice, Kim L', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Christie, Amanda', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Ngo, Vu', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Moreau, Lisa A', 'Byers, Richard J', 'Christensen, James G', 'Vande Woude, George', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Kentsis A', 'Reed C', 'Rice KL', 'Sanda T', 'Rodig SJ', 'Tholouli E', 'Christie A', 'Valk PJ', 'Delwel R', 'Ngo V', 'Kutok JL', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Moreau LA', 'Byers RJ', 'Christensen JG', 'Vande Woude G', 'Licht JD', 'Kung AL', 'Staudt LM', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA160660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 CA151240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA160660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,PMC3438345,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2819 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2819 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2012 Jul;18(7):1118-22. doi: 10.1038/nm.2819.,20120919,10.1038/nm.2819 [doi],,,"['0 (HGF protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Crizotinib', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/metabolism', 'Remission Induction']",['NIHMS374188'],,,,"['Nat Rev Cancer. 2012 Aug;12(8):505.

AA forms various DNA adducts and is thought to play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. Transient DNA adducts are usually repaired, but the stability of AA-derived DNA adducts has not been elucidated. We investigated the stability of N(2)-ethylidene-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-ethylidene-dG), a major AA-derived DNA adduct, in cultured cells. First, to determine the optimal concentration of AA for detecting N(2)-ethylidene-dG in cell culture, a dose-response study was performed using HL60 cells of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. An AA concentration >/= 0.01% (1.8 mM) was required to detect N(2)-ethylidene-dG in vitro. We next examined the stability of N(2)-ethylidene-dG. After a 1 or 2h exposure to 0.01% of AA in a tightly sealed bottle, N(2)-ethylidene-dG content was measured by sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry immediately, 24h, and 48 h after exposure. After the 1h exposure, the mean (+/- SD) N(2)-ethylidene-dG contents were 12.1 +/- 1.28, 8.20 +/- 0.64, and 6.70 +/- 0.52 adducts per 10(7) bases at each postexposure time. After the 2h exposure, N(2)-ethylidene-dG content increased to 21.4 +/- 7.50, 10.5 +/- 3.61, and 9.83 +/- 3.90 adducts per 10(7) bases at each postexposure time. The half-life of this adduct was calculated as approximately 35 h in independent experiments. These results indicate that AA exposure from daily alcohol consumption may cause DNA damage and may increase the risk of alcohol-related carcinogenesis.","['Hori, Kimiko', ""Miyamoto, Shin'ichi"", 'Yukawa, Yoshiyuki', 'Muto, Manabu', 'Chiba, Tsutomu', 'Matsuda, Tomonari']","['Hori K', 'Miyamoto S', 'Yukawa Y', 'Muto M', 'Chiba T', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120605,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)01066-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jul 13;423(4):642-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.158.

DJ-1 has been implicated in protection of neurons from oxidative stress and in regulation of transcriptional activity. However, whether there is a relationship between the subcellular localization of DJ-1 and its function remains unknown. Therefore, we examined the subcellular localization of DJ-1 during dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by various insults. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry showed that the nuclear pool of DJ-1 dramatically increased in both MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells and primary cultures of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. This was paralleled by a corresponding decrease in its cytosolic level, indicating drug-induced nuclear translocation of DJ-1. The same phenomenon was detected in other cell death paradigms induced by pro-oxidants including hydrogen peroxide and cupric chloride. Consequently, cotreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine blocked the translocation of DJ-1 into the nucleus. However, mutation at cysteine 106 had no effect on the translocation of DJ-1 into the nucleus, suggesting that reactive oxygen species-mediated downstream signaling and/or modifications other than oxidative modification are involved in its nuclear translocation. Ectopic expression of nucleus localization signal (NLS)-tagged DJ-1 prevented cell death from 6-OHDA. We investigated whether nuclear DJ-1 was involved in transcriptional regulation and found that DJ-1 was localized in promyelocytic leukemia bodies, and this localization increased upon 6-OHDA treatment. We also confirmed that binding of DJ-1 and promyelocytic leukemia bodies indeed increased after 6-OHDA treatment. Consequently, expression levels of acetylated p53 and PUMA were downregulated in cells overexpressing DJ-1 or NLS-tagged DJ-1. Taken together, our data suggest that nuclear translocation of DJ-1 may protect neurons from cell death after oxidative stress.","['Kim, Su-Jeong', 'Park, Yun-Jong', 'Hwang, Ih-Yeon', 'Youdim, Moussa B H', 'Park, Kang-Sik', 'Oh, Young J']","['Kim SJ', 'Park YJ', 'Hwang IY', 'Youdim MB', 'Park KS', 'Oh YJ']","['Department of Systems Biology, Yonsei University College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Seoul 120-749, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(12)00292-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2012 Aug 15;53(4):936-50. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.035.

In this article, we overview studies demonstrating prognostic implications of being suboptimal responders to imatinib as well as results of recent clinical trials testing new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this setting.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120606,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(12)00351-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2012 Dec 1;325(1):18-25. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.032.

The embryonic stem cell gene NANOG, a divergent homeodomain transcription factor that is independent of leukemia inhibitory factor, has been reported to be expressed in germ cells and in several tumor types. However, the short-term expression and role of NANOG in cervical cancer remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that NANOG exhibits cellular shuttling behavior and increasing stromal distribution during the progression of cervical cancer. Our molecular data using RT-PCR and restriction enzyme digestion show that NANOG is mainly transcribed from the NANOG gene in cervical cancer. In addition, IHC using confocal microscopy suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one type of cytoplasmic NANOG-positive cells in cervical cancer stroma. Co-culture of cervical cancer-derived MSCs with SiHa cells showed increased proliferation characteristics in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that MSCs are a source of cytoplasmic NANOG expression in the cervical cancer stroma and that they participate in the progression of cervical cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides evidence that NANOG is a cervical cancer progression marker and also serves as a starting point for a more extensive exploration of the cellular translocation of NANOG and the multifunctionality of the stromal microenvironment.","['Gu, Ting-Ting', 'Liu, Shu-Yan', 'Zheng, Peng-Sheng']","['Gu TT', 'Liu SY', 'Zheng PS']","[""Department of Reproductive Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(12)00342-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2012 Aug;181(2):652-61. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.04.008.

With the aim of assessing the influence of the hydrophobic character, the conformational flexibility and the stereochemistry of the C-ring functionalities on the cytotoxic activity, a variety of spirostanic aglycones incorporating methylene, methoxyl, alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone and lactone groups were subjected to a linear glycosylation strategy leading to glycosides derived from the 3,6-dipivaloylated beta-D-glucoside and the beta-chacotrioside moieties. The 3,6-dipivaloylated spirostanyl beta-D-glucosides showed moderate to good cytotoxic activity against HL-60, but no significant cytotoxicity against benign blood cells. However, the cytotoxicity of spirostanyl beta-chacotriosides was highly dependent on the nature of the C-ring functional groups of the steroidal aglycones. Actually, the chacotrioside-based saponins either with no functionality or bearing a hydrophobic methylene group at C-12 were the most cytotoxic ones against both HL-60 and benign blood cells. On the other hand, the incorporation of very polar functionalities and the opening of the ring C with the consequent loss of rigidity led to a significant drop in the cytotoxicity against HL-60. These results confirm that spirostanyl beta-chacotriosides including very lipophilic aglycones are the most cytotoxic ones among their congeners.","['Perez-Labrada, Karell', 'Brouard, Ignacio', 'Estevez, Sara', 'Marrero, Maria Teresa', 'Estevez, Francisco', 'Rivera, Daniel G']","['Perez-Labrada K', 'Brouard I', 'Estevez S', 'Marrero MT', 'Estevez F', 'Rivera DG']","['Institute of Pharmacy and Food, University of Havana, San Lazaro y L, 10400 La Habana, Cuba.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/11/03 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(12)00392-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2012.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2012 Jul 15;20(14):4522-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2012.05.018.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Reanalysis of the US peptic ulcer data testing for heterogeneity of radiogenic risk by cancer endpoint (stomach, pancreas, lung, leukemia, all other). RESULTS: There are statistically significant (P<.05) excess risks for all cancer and for lung cancer and borderline statistically significant risks for stomach cancer (P=.07), and leukemia (P=.06), with excess relative risks Gy(-1) of 0.024 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.011, 0.039), 0.559 (95% CI 0.221, 1.021), 0.042 (95% CI -0.002, 0.119), and 1.087 (95% CI -0.018, 4.925), respectively. There is statistically significant (P=.007) excess risk of pancreatic cancer when adjusted for dose-response curvature. General downward curvature is apparent in the dose response, statistically significant (P<.05) for all cancers, pancreatic cancer, and all other cancers (ie, other than stomach, pancreas, lung, leukemia). There are indications of reduction in relative risk with increasing age at exposure (for all cancers, pancreatic cancer), but no evidence for quadratic variations in relative risk with age at exposure. If a linear-exponential dose response is used, there is no significant heterogeneity in the dose response among the 5 endpoints considered or in the speed of variation of relative risk with age at exposure. The risks are generally consistent with those observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and in groups of nuclear workers. CONCLUSIONS: There are excess risks for various malignancies in this data set. Generally there is a marked downward curvature in the dose response and significant reduction in relative risk with increasing age at exposure. The consistency of risks with those observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and in groups of nuclear workers implies that there may be little sparing effect of fractionation of dose or low-dose-rate exposure.","['Little, Mark P', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Smith, Susan A', 'Kleinerman, Ruth A']","['Little MP', 'Stovall M', 'Smith SA', 'Kleinerman RA']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7238, USA. mark.little@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120609,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,PMC3440544,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(12)00582-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.04.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2013 Feb 1;85(2):451-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.04.029.

We characterized a new three-way translocation involving MLL in an infant with acute myeloid leukemia who subsequently relapsed and underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated stem cell donor. The translocation was characterized using karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this patient, a complex rearrangement fused the distal part of 11q23 with 17q11.2, the distal part of 17q11.2 with 1q21, and the distal part of 1q21 with 11q23, resulting in a three-way translocation; t(1;11;17)(q21;q23;q11.2). The two reciprocal MLL fusion sites were cloned by long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction, which led to the identification of MLL-MLLT11 and the reciprocal MYO18A-MLL fusion alleles. Both fusion genes are in-frame and can be translated into functional fusion proteins. Although the MLL-MLLT11 fusion gene has been described in the literature, the reciprocal MYO18A fusion partner is a novel candidate gene in the growing list of reciprocal MLL fusions.","['Ussowicz, Marek', 'Jaskowiec, Anna', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Haus, Olga']","['Ussowicz M', 'Jaskowiec A', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Chybicka A', 'Szczepanski T', 'Haus O']","['Wroclaw Medical University, Department of Pediatric BMT, Hematology and Oncology, Wroclaw, Poland. ussowicz@tlen.pl']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(12)00050-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2012 May;205(5):261-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.006.,20120828,10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.006 [doi],,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT11 protein, human)', '0 (MYO18A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*genetics', 'Myosins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Chromosomal aberrations involving 3q26 comprise 1-2% of all acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These changes result in overexpression of the EVI1 oncogene. EVI1 transcriptional activation has been reported in up to 10% of AML patients, even in the absence of 3q26 changes, and is an independent indicator of adverse prognosis. Rearrangements of the EVI1 locus are often associated with monosomy 7. We present a case of acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis with a unique EVI1 amplification within a derivative 8 chromosome, characterized by karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization, conventional high resolution comparative genomic hybridization, as well as by gene expression studies. We conclude that EVI1 overexpression as a consequence of EVI1 gene amplification causes similar biological effects to the changes caused by the typical 3q26 aberrations such as an inv(3)(q21q26) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) with EVI1 gene rearrangements.","['Grygalewicz, Beata', 'Woroniecka, Renata', 'Pastwinska, Anna', 'Rygier, Jolanta', 'Krawczyk, Paulina', 'Borg, Katarzyna', 'Makuch-Lasica, Hanna', 'Patkowska, Elzbieta', 'Pienkowska-Grela, Barbara']","['Grygalewicz B', 'Woroniecka R', 'Pastwinska A', 'Rygier J', 'Krawczyk P', 'Borg K', 'Makuch-Lasica H', 'Patkowska E', 'Pienkowska-Grela B']","['Cytogenetic Laboratory, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute, Warsaw, Poland. bgrygal@coi.waw.pl']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(12)00047-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2012 May;205(5):255-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.003.,20120828,10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.02.003 [doi],,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A study was designed to investigate the safety of imatinib and its efficacy in preventing hematological relapse and improving disease-free survival (DFS) when administered after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). METHODS: Patients with Ph + ALL that received allo-HCT were enrolled in the study. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect BCR-ABL transcript levels. Imatinib therapy was initiated if patient neutrophil counts were > 1.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet counts were > 50.0 x 10(9)/L, or if they displayed either elevated BCR-ABL transcript levels in two consecutive tests, or a BCR-ABL transcript level >/= 10(-2) after initial engraftment. Patients receiving imatinib after relapse were assigned to the non-imatinib group. The imatinib treatment was scheduled for 3-12 months, until BCR-ABL transcript levels were negative at least for three consecutive tests or complete molecular remission was sustained for at least 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were enrolled. Sixty-two patients initiated imatinib therapy post-HCT. Imatinib therapy was initiated at a median time of 70 days post-HCT. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 17.7% of patients. Ten patients (16.1%) terminated imatinib therapy owing to AEs. Among the patients in imatinib and non-imatinib groups, the estimated 5-year relapse rate was 10.2% and 33.1% (p = 0.016), and the 5-year probability of DFS was 81.5% and 33.5% (p = 0.000) with the median follow-up of 31 months (range, 2.5-76 months) and 24.5 months (range, 4-72 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified imatinib maintenance therapy post-HCT as an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.000, hazard ratio [HR] =4.8) and OS (p = 0.000, HR = 6.2). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that relapse rate can be reduced and DFS may be improved in Ph + ALL patients with imatinib maintenance therapy after HCT. BCR-ABLmonitoring by qRT-PCR can guide maintenance therapy with imatinib including initiation time and treatment duration after allo-HCT.","['Chen, Huan', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Chen, Yu-hong', 'Zhao, Xiang-yu', 'Han, Wei', 'Zhang, Xiao-hui', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Yuan-yuan', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Liu, Yan-rong', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Chen H', 'Liu KY', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Chen YH', 'Zhao XY', 'Han W', 'Zhang XH', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang YY', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, PR China.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120608,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC3407007,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-29 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jun 8;5:29. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-29.,20121220,10.1186/1756-8722-5-29 [doi],,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*mortality/therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to investigate by qRT-PCR the expression of miRNAs involved in myeloid differentiation (miR-424, miR-155, miR-223, miR-17-5p) in 48 patients with cytogenetically normal AML well characterized for NPM1 and/or FLT3 mutations. Three types of normalization were used for the data validation. FINDINGS: We found that miR-424 was down-modulated in AMLs with NPM1mutA regardless of FLT3 status. On the contrary, miR-155 showed up-regulation in patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) with or without NPM1 mutations. No significant associations were found by analyzing miR-223 and miR-17-5p in relation to FLT3 and NPM1 status.

We aimed to assess the excess risk of leukaemia and brain tumours after CT scans in a cohort of children and young adults. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we included patients without previous cancer diagnoses who were first examined with CT in National Health Service (NHS) centres in England, Wales, or Scotland (Great Britain) between 1985 and 2002, when they were younger than 22 years of age. We obtained data for cancer incidence, mortality, and loss to follow-up from the NHS Central Registry from Jan 1, 1985, to Dec 31, 2008. We estimated absorbed brain and red bone marrow doses per CT scan in mGy and assessed excess incidence of leukaemia and brain tumours cancer with Poisson relative risk models. To avoid inclusion of CT scans related to cancer diagnosis, follow-up for leukaemia began 2 years after the first CT and for brain tumours 5 years after the first CT. FINDINGS: During follow-up, 74 of 178,604 patients were diagnosed with leukaemia and 135 of 176,587 patients were diagnosed with brain tumours. We noted a positive association between radiation dose from CT scans and leukaemia (excess relative risk [ERR] per mGy 0.036, 95% CI 0.005-0.120; p=0.0097) and brain tumours (0.023, 0.010-0.049; p<0.0001). Compared with patients who received a dose of less than 5 mGy, the relative risk of leukaemia for patients who received a cumulative dose of at least 30 mGy (mean dose 51.13 mGy) was 3.18 (95% CI 1.46-6.94) and the relative risk of brain cancer for patients who received a cumulative dose of 50-74 mGy (mean dose 60.42 mGy) was 2.82 (1.33-6.03). INTERPRETATION: Use of CT scans in children to deliver cumulative doses of about 50 mGy might almost triple the risk of leukaemia and doses of about 60 mGy might triple the risk of brain cancer. Because these cancers are relatively rare, the cumulative absolute risks are small: in the 10 years after the first scan for patients younger than 10 years, one excess case of leukaemia and one excess case of brain tumour per 10,000 head CT scans is estimated to occur. Nevertheless, although clinical benefits should outweigh the small absolute risks, radiation doses from CT scans ought to be kept as low as possible and alternative procedures, which do not involve ionising radiation, should be considered if appropriate.

In most cases, the initial disease is herpes zoster. Different diseases may subsequently develop on the same site. The most common isotopic responses are granulomatous and lichenoid reactions, infiltrations of hematologic diseases, skin tumors, and infections. The pathogenesis of these skin reactions is unknown. It has been suggested that viral infection may alter local skin immunity; this would favor hyperreactivity, leading to inflammatory processes, or local immunosuppression, leading to tumor infiltrations or infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 9 patients diagnosed with Wolf's isotopic response in the dermatology department of Hospital Donostia in San Sebastian, Spain. Five patients had B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 had a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1 had ovarian carcinoma. RESULTS: The initial disease was herpes zoster in 7 cases, and chickenpox and herpes simplex in the other 2 cases. The second disease was granulomatous dermatitis in 4 cases, lichenoid dermatitis in 2 cases, infiltration by B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia in 2 cases, and infiltration by systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1 case. In the last case, the skin lesions were the first sign of the lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the need to biopsy these second lesions in order to rule out tumor infiltrations, which were more frequent than expected in our series.","['Jaka-Moreno, A', 'Lopez-Pestana, A', 'Lopez-Nunez, M', 'Ormaechea-Perez, N', 'Vildosola-Esturo, S', 'Tuneu-Valls, A', 'Lobo-Moran, C']","['Jaka-Moreno A', 'Lopez-Pestana A', 'Lopez-Nunez M', 'Ormaechea-Perez N', 'Vildosola-Esturo S', 'Tuneu-Valls A', 'Lobo-Moran C']","['Departamento de Dermatologia, Hospital Donostia, Donostia-San Sebastian, Gipuzkoa, Espana. ajaka@aedv.es']","['eng', 'spa']",,['Journal Article'],20120606,Spain,Actas Dermosifiliogr,Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,0373062,,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0001-7310(12)00159-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ad.2012.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Actas Dermosifiliogr. 2012 Nov;103(9):798-805. doi: 10.1016/j.ad.2012.02.007.

Recent advances in cell reprogramming technology to produce induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can be differentiated to multiple adult cell types, has further expanded the potential of cord blood cell therapy for treatment of non-blood-borne diseases. However, in order to harness this breakthrough technology and to provide clinical-grade cells for the patient, standardization of iPS production and differentiation, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) need to be employed. AREAS COVERED: UCB is an ethical source of stem cells and has been used to treat diseases including leukemia, cancer and blood disorders. The development of iPS cell technology could potentially greatly increase the application of cord blood cells as a treatment for a broader range of diseases, UCB-iPS banks could, therefore, be a valuable complementary source of clinical-grade cells for cell therapy. The current applicability of GMP to UCB and UCB-iPS cell-based cell therapy will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although cord blood stem cell therapies have been practiced for decades, UCB-iPS cell therapies are a new innovation currently in development. Successful clinical applications of such novel cell therapies will depend on the production of GMP-compliant cells and the establishment of cell banks.","['Zhou, Hongyan', 'Chang, Stephen', 'Rao, Mahendra']","['Zhou H', 'Chang S', 'Rao M']","['New York Stem Cell Foundation, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120611,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2012.691161 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2012 Aug;12(8):1059-66. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2012.691161.

Recently, a specific endocytotic uptake mechanism of C3bot was identified in macrophages and myeloid leukemia cells. Here, we present a novel delivery system based upon a mutant C3bot devoid of ADP-ribosylation activity (C3Mut) and wild-type streptavidin (Stv). The C3Mut moiety mediates endocytosis into macrophages, whereas Stv functions as an adaptor protein for attaching biotinylated molecules to facilitate their subsequent internalization. First, a bioconjugate consisting of recombinant C3Mut and Stv was generated via a thioether linkage that tightly interacted with biotinylated bovine serum albumin as demonstrated by dot blot analysis. We then showed the internalization of C3Mut-Stv into J774A.1 macrophages by confocal microscopy and observed translocation into the cytosol using cell fractionation. The C3Mut-Stv bioconjugate did not affect cell viability. Next, we prepared mono-biotinylated RNase A, which was attached to the C3Mut-Stv transporter, and demonstrated its C3Mut-Stv-mediated delivery into the cytosol of J774A.1 cells. Finally, C3Mut-Stv also promoted the efficient uptake of mono-biotinylated lysozyme into J774A.1 cells, highlighting its versatility. This study intriguingly demonstrates the use of the novel C3Mut-Stv delivery system for protein transduction and may provide a basis for future applications, in particular, of cytotoxic RNase A mutants.","['Lillich, Maren', 'Chen, Xi', 'Weil, Tanja', 'Barth, Holger', 'Fahrer, Jorg']","['Lillich M', 'Chen X', 'Weil T', 'Barth H', 'Fahrer J']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120620,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc300041z [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2012 Jul 18;23(7):1426-36. doi: 10.1021/bc300041z.

Chromosome instability is a hallmark of most cancer cells. Chromosomal abnormalities are correlated with poor prognosis, disease classification, risk stratification, and treatment selection. Copy number alterations (CNAs) are an important molecular signature in cancer initiation, development, and progression. Recent application of whole-genome tools to characterize normal and cancer genomes provides the powerful molecular cytogenetic means to enumerate the multiple somatic, genetic and epigenetic alterations that occur in cancer. Combined array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array is a useful technique allowing detection of CNAs and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or uni-parental disomy (UPD) together in a single experiment. It also provides allelic information on deletions, duplications, and amplifications. UPD can result in an abnormal phenotype when the chromosomes involved are imprinted. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common clonal stem cell hematologic malignancy characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, which leads to rapid progression into acute myeloid leukemia. UPD that occurs without concurrent changes in the gene copy number is a common chromosomal defect in hematologic malignancies, especially in MDS. Approximately 40-50% of MDS patients do not have karyotypic abnormalities that are detectable using classical metaphase cytogenetic techniques (MC) because of inherent limitations of MC, low resolution and the requirement of having dividing cells. In this review, we highlight advances in the clinical application of microarray technology in MDS and discuss the clinical potential of microarray.","['Ahmad, Ausaf', 'Iqbal, M Anwar']","['Ahmad A', 'Iqbal MA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Ave., Box 608 Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,,2012/06/12 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20120607-19 [pii]', '10.2174/092986712801661121 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2012;19(22):3739-47. doi: 10.2174/092986712801661121.,20121212,,,,,IM,"['Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Uniparental Disomy/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the prognostic value of skeletal morbidity in de novo adult ALL, we identified 20 patients with ALL with skeletal morbidity and compared them with matched patients with ALL but without skeletal morbidity (n = 60). Compared with controls, patients with skeletal morbidity responded poorly to treatment, with a lower incidence of complete remission (p = 0.02) and shorter continued remission duration (p = 0.031). The overall survival (OS) (38.67% vs. 69.44%, p = 0.03) and event-free survival (EFS) (25.67% vs. 58.77%, p = 0.008) were inferior to those of controls. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) may be beneficial to patients with skeletal morbidity. For patients with skeletal morbidity, OS at 12 months was 72.92% in patients who underwent allo-HSCT, while it was 38.5% for patients treated with chemotherapy (p = 0.03). By multivariate analysis, skeletal morbidity was an independent prognostic factor in adult patients with ALL. These results confirm the poor prognosis of patients with ALL with skeletal morbidity and reinforce interest in evaluating the incorporation of allo-HSCT in adult patients with ALL with skeletal morbidity onset.","['Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Wang, Libing', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Chen, Li', 'Lv, Shuqing', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Hu X', 'Song X', 'Wang L', 'Yang J', 'Zhang W', 'Chen L', 'Lv S', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120709,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/06/12 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/06/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.701740 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jan;54(1):117-22. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.701740.

METHODS: Squalenoyl-Ara-C conjugate (Sq-Ara-C) self-assembled nanosystems were obtained by the nanoprecipitation method and characterized in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: This new nanomedicine, which had a mean diameter of approximately 150 nm, improved the in vitro antitumoral activity of Ara-C in different cancer cell lines (L1210, K562, and MCF-7). Sq-Ara-C nanomedicine allowed reduction of the IC(50) value with respect to the free drug and was also active against drug-resistant leukemic cells (L1210R). A noticeable increase in the survival rate of mice with aggressive metastatic L1210R leukemia was observed after treatment with Sq-Ara-C (50 mg/kg) as compared with the free active compound (100 mg/kg). Finally, evaluation of the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug demonstrated that these nanoaggregates preferentially localized to the liver and spleen, and protected the drug from physiological metabolism. CONCLUSION: Squalenoylation of cytarabine offers several pharmacological benefits both in vitro and in vivo.","['Cosco, Donato', 'Rocco, Flavio', 'Ceruti, Maurizio', 'Vono, Margherita', 'Fresta, Massimo', 'Paolino, Donatella']","['Cosco D', 'Rocco F', 'Ceruti M', 'Vono M', 'Fresta M', 'Paolino D']","['Department of Health Sciences, University Magna Graecia, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC3367491,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S28114 [doi]', 'ijn-7-2535 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:2535-46. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S28114.

We investigated the role of HDAC3 in allergic skin inflammation. We used a BALB/c mouse model of triphasic cutaneous anaphylaxis (triphasic cutaneous reaction; TpCR) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) to examine the role of HDAC3 in allergic skin inflammation. Triphasic cutaneous reaction involved induction of HDAC3 and was mediated by HDAC3. HDAC3 showed an interaction with FcepsilonRIbeta. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC(s), disrupted this interaction. Cytokine array analysis showed that the down-regulation of HDAC3 led to the decreased secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1). FcepsilonRI was necessary for induction of HDAC3 and MCP1. ChIP assays showed that HDAC3, in association with Sp1 and c-Jun, was responsible for induction of MCP1 expression. TSA exerted a negative effect on induction of MCP1. HDAC3 exerted a negative regulation on expression of HDAC2 via interaction with Rac1. The down-regulation of HDAC3 or inactivation of Rac1 induced binding of HDAC2 to MCP1 promoter sequences. TSA exerted a negative effect on HDAC3-mediated TpCR. The BALB/c mouse model of PCA involved induction of HDAC3 and MCP1. HDAC3 and MCP1 were necessary for PCA that involved ear swelling, enhanced vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. Recombinant MCP1 enhanced beta-hexosaminidase activity and histamine release and also showed angiogenic potential. TSA exerted a negative effect on PCA. Our data show HDAC3 as a valuable target for the development of allergic skin inflammation therapeutics.","['Kim, Youngmi', 'Kim, Kyungjong', 'Park, Deokbum', 'Lee, Eunmi', 'Lee, Hansoo', 'Lee, Yun-Sil', 'Choe, Jongseon', 'Jeoung, Dooil']","['Kim Y', 'Kim K', 'Park D', 'Lee E', 'Lee H', 'Lee YS', 'Choe J', 'Jeoung D']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 200-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3406670,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)73597-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.348284 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jul 27;287(31):25844-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.348284.

To investigate its impact on phagocyte NADPH oxidase (phox) activity in a neutrophil model, the protein was knocked down in PLB-985 cells using stable expression of a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and phox activity was monitored after cell differentiation. The knockdown cells had reduced oxidase activity in response to stimulation with the formylated peptide fMLF, but the response to the phorbol ester PMA was unchanged. Reintroduction of shRNA-resistant Prdx6-PLA(2) into the knockdown cells by stable transfection with a Prdx6-PLA(2) expression plasmid restored the fMLF response, as did reintroduction of Prdx6-PLA(2) mutated in the Prdx active site; reintroduction of PLA(2) active site mutants, however, failed to restore the response. Thus, the PLA(2) activity of Prdx6-PLA(2) in intact cells mediates its ability to enhance phox activity in response to fMLF. In combination with previous publications by other groups, our work indicates that various PLA(2) isoforms can enhance oxidase activity but they are differentially important in different cell types and in the response to different agonists.","['Ellison, Michael A', 'Thurman, Gail W', 'Ambruso, Daniel R']","['Ellison MA', 'Thurman GW', 'Ambruso DR']","['Bonfils Blood Center, Denver, CO 80230, USA.']",['eng'],"['K07 HL088968/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201142157 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2012 Jun;42(6):1609-17. doi: 10.1002/eji.201142157.,20120813,10.1002/eji.201142157 [doi],,,"['11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin VI)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxin VI/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mutations in the spliceosome machinery have recently been identified using whole-exome/genome technologies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and in other hematological disorders. Alterations in splicing factor 3 subunit b1 (SF3b1) were the first spliceosomal mutations described, immediately followed by identification of other splicing factor mutations, including U2 small nuclear RNA auxillary factor 1 (U2AF1) and serine arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2). SF3b1/U2AF1/SRSF2 mutations occur at varying frequencies in different disease subtypes, each contributing to differences in survival outcomes. However, the exact functional consequences of these spliceosomal mutations in the pathogenesis of MDS and other hematological malignancies remain largely unknown and subject to intense investigation. For SF3b1, a gain of function mutation may offer the promise of new targeted therapies for diseases that carry this molecular abnormality that can potentially lead to cure. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging role of the spliceosome machinery in the biology of MDS/hematological disorders with an emphasis on the functional consequences of mutations, their clinical significance, and perspectives on how they may influence our understanding and management of diseases affected by these mutations.","['Visconte, V', 'Makishima, H', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Tiu, R V']","['Visconte V', 'Makishima H', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120515,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3645466,2012/06/09 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012130 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.130 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2447-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.130.

From July 1998 to January 2008, 212 MM patients were randomized to C (n=69), T (n=76) or O (n=67). The incidence of SBI was comparable among groups: C=12.5%, T=6.8% and O=15.9%; P=0.218. Further, any infection during the first 2 months was also comparable (20% vs 23% vs 22%, respectively, P=0.954). We demonstrate that prophylactic antibiotics did not decrease the incidence of SBI (>/=grade 3) within the first 2 months of treatment. We conclude that routine use of prophylactic antibiotics should not be mandated for patients receiving induction chemotherapy.","['Vesole, D H', 'Oken, M M', 'Heckler, C', 'Greipp, P R', 'Katz, M S', 'Jacobus, S', 'Morrow, G R']","['Vesole DH', 'Oken MM', 'Heckler C', 'Greipp PR', 'Katz MS', 'Jacobus S', 'Morrow GR']","['The John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA. dvesole@humed.com']",['eng'],"['U10 CA013650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA023318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA037420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120508,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4734137,2012/06/09 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012124 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2517-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.124.

It has been shown that SET is upregulated in BCR-ABL1-positive cell lines, patient-derived chronic myeloid leukemia CD34-positive cells, and some solid tumors. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We determined the expression level of SET in 59 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who were BCR-ABL-negative using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results. We showed that SET expression was significantly upregulated in 96.5% of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (28 of 29; 16.6 fold) and 93% of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (28 of 30; 47.6 fold) patients. This upregulation was not associated with any clinical features or overall and relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that SET is significantly overexpressed in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, and an increased level of SET might contribute to leukemic process.","['Sirma Ekmekci, Sema', 'G Ekmekci, Cumhur', 'Kandilci, Ayten', 'Gulec, Cagri', 'Akbiyik, Meral', 'Emrence, Zeliha', 'Abaci, Neslihan', 'Karakas, Zeynep', 'Agaoglu, Leyla', 'Unuvar, Aysegul', 'Anak, Sema', 'Devecioglu, Omer', 'Ustek, Duran', 'Grosveld, Gerard', 'Ozbek, Ugur']","['Sirma Ekmekci S', 'G Ekmekci C', 'Kandilci A', 'Gulec C', 'Akbiyik M', 'Emrence Z', 'Abaci N', 'Karakas Z', 'Agaoglu L', 'Unuvar A', 'Anak S', 'Devecioglu O', 'Ustek D', 'Grosveld G', 'Ozbek U']","['Istanbul University, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Department of Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1700/1088.11938 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumori. 2012 Mar-Apr;98(2):252-6. doi: 10.1700/1088.11938.,20120814,10.1700/1088.11938 [doi],,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported previously that DHA specifically targets pro-erythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, when human CD34+ stem cells are differentiated toward the erythroid lineage, indicating that a window of susceptibility to artemisinins may exist also in human developmental erythropoiesis during pregnancy. To better investigate the toxicity of artemisinin derivatives, the structure-activity relationship was evaluated against the K562 leukaemia cell line, used as a model for differentiating early human erythroblasts. All artemisinins derivatives, except deoxyartemisinin, inhibited both spontaneous and induced erythroid differentiation, confirming that the peroxide bridge is responsible for the erythro-toxicity. On the contrary, cell growth was markedly reduced by DHA, artemisone and artesunate but not by artemisinin, 10-deoxoartemisinin or deoxy-artemisinin. The substituent at position C-10 is responsible only for the anti-proliferative effect, since 10-deoxoartemisinin did not reduce cell growth but arrested the differentiation of K562 cells. In particular, the results showed that DHA resulted the most potent and rapidly acting compound of the drug family, causing (i) the decreased expression of GpA surface receptors and the down regulation the gamma-globin gene; (ii) the alteration of S phase of cell cycle and (iii) the induction of programmed cell death of early erythroblasts in a dose dependent manner within 24h. In conclusion, these findings confirm that the active metabolite DHA is responsible for the erythro-toxicity of most of artemisinins used in therapy. Thus, as long as no further clinical data are available, current WHO recommendations of avoiding malaria treatment with artemisinins during the first trimester of pregnancy remain valid.","['Finaurini, Sara', 'Basilico, Nicoletta', 'Corbett, Yolanda', ""D'Alessandro, Sarah"", 'Parapini, Silvia', 'Olliaro, Piero', 'Haynes, Richard K', 'Taramelli, Donatella']","['Finaurini S', 'Basilico N', 'Corbett Y', ""D'Alessandro S"", 'Parapini S', 'Olliaro P', 'Haynes RK', 'Taramelli D']","['Dipartimento di Sanita Pubblica-Microbiologia-Virologia, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Pascal 36, 20133 Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120605,Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-483X(12)00204-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2012.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2012 Oct 9;300(1-2):57-66. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2012.05.024.

In this study, capillary electrophoretic analysis of imatinib mesylate and related compounds was developed. The optimized separation condition was NaH(2)PO(4) (10 mM) aqueous solution containing 5 mM of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin at a pH of 2.0. The separation could be obtained in less than 20 min when the separation voltage was 20 kV. To enhance the sensitivity, field amplified sample stacking combining with large volume sample injection was adopted. The optimal injection conditions were obtained by using methanol containing 0.5 mM HCl as the sample dilution solution and performing injection at a voltage of 15 kV for 60 s. The linearity ranges of ima amine, N-desmethyl imatinib and imatinib mesylate were 0.005-0.500 mug/ml, and 4-chloromethyl-N-(4-methyl-3-((4-(pyridin-3-yl) pyrimidin-2-yl) amino) phenyl) benzamide was 0.010-0.500 mug/ml, with good linear correlation coefficients (r(2)>0.9900). The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations of peak areas were satisfactory. Under the optimized condition, five batches of the synthesized samples were detected and ima amine was found in all the batches. Due to its simplicity, effectiveness and low price, the developed method can be used for quality control analysis of imatinib mesylate.","['Li, Jian', 'Huang, Yifei', 'Huang, Lei', 'Ye, Lei', 'Zhou, Zhou', 'Xiang, Guangya', 'Xu, Li']","['Li J', 'Huang Y', 'Huang L', 'Ye L', 'Zhou Z', 'Xiang G', 'Xu L']","['Tongji School of Pharmacy, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,,2012/06/09 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0731-7085(12)00246-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2012 Nov;70:26-31. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.010.

Studies have shown that the expression of upregulated gene 4 (URG4), which promotes cell growth and survival, is increased in different types of carcinomas including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and osteosarcoma. Similarly, higher expression of URG4 and cyclin D1 gene might promote proliferation of the blast cells by causing escape from the G1 checkpoint and entry into the S phase. This study reports the high expression level of URG4 in 2 high-risk ALL patients for the first time in the literature. In conclusion, the higher expression of URG4 in our 2 patients suggests that URG4 might be involved in leukemogenesis.

Amsacrine is a rationally designed anticancer drug, used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Binding with cellular DNA is a crucial step in its mechanism of cytotoxicity. Despite numerous studies, DNA binding properties of amsacrine are poorly understood. Its reversible binding with DNA does not permit X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopic evaluation of amsacrine-DNA complexes. In the present work, interaction of amsacrine with calf thymus DNA is investigated at physiological conditions. UV-visible, FT-Raman and circular dichroism spectroscopic techniques were employed to determine the binding mode, binding constant, sequence specificity and conformational effects of amsacrine binding to native calf thymus DNA. Our results illustrate that amsacrine interacts with DNA by and large through intercalation between base pairs. Binding constant of the amsacrine-DNA complex was found to be K=1.2+/-0.1x10(4) M(-1) which is indicative of moderate type of binding of amsacrine to DNA. Raman spectroscopic results suggest that amsacrine has a binding preference of intercalation between AT base pairs of DNA. Minor groove binding is also observed in amsacrine-DNA complexes. These results are in good agreement with in silico investigation of amsacrine binding to DNA and thus provide detailed insight into DNA binding properties of amsacrine, which could ultimately, renders its cytotoxic efficacy.","['Jangir, Deepak Kumar', 'Dey, Sanjay Kumar', 'Kundu, Suman', 'Mehrotra, Ranjana']","['Jangir DK', 'Dey SK', 'Kundu S', 'Mehrotra R']","['Quantum Optics and Photon Physics, National Physical Laboratory, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. K.S.

The study demonstrated that ATG induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation in both cell lines and primary leukemic cells, particularly in lymphatic origin cells, indicating that ATG has broad-spectrum antileukemic activity, especially for cells of lymphatic origin. BACKGROUND: Polyclonal ATGs are currently used to prevent graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients and to treat patients with severe aplastic anemia. It contains antibodies against antigens expressed on various hematopoietic cells, we hypothesized that it induces cell death not only in healthy cells but also in malignant hematopoietic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, several human leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells from 15 patients with leukemia were used to investigate the ability of polyclonal ATGs to induce apoptosis and proliferation. RESULTS: Polyclonal ATGs induced cell apoptosis in primary leukemic cells and in cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and induced apoptosis in different populations through a variety of targets. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced in the presence of polyclonal ATGs; it arrested cells in the G0-G1 phase by cell cycle analysis. Treatment with polyclonal ATGs plus complement increased cytolysis of the leukemic cells; complement augments polyclonal ATG-induced leukemic cell death. CONCLUSION: These data show that polyclonal ATG has broad-spectrum antileukemic activity, especially for cells of lymphatic origin, as it induced cell death through a variety of targets. This study provides an experimental basis for the application of polyclonal ATGs in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in patients with lymphatic leukemia.","['Liu, Huixia', 'Qin, Youwen', 'Wang, Xiaorui', 'Xie, Kuangcheng', 'Yang, Yining', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Zhao, Chuxian', 'Wang, Chun']","['Liu H', 'Qin Y', 'Wang X', 'Xie K', 'Yang Y', 'Zhu J', 'Zhao C', 'Wang C']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University affiliated with The First People Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,2012/06/09 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00087-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Oct;12(5):345-54. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.006.

Blocking CRM1-mediated nuclear export of such proteins is a novel therapeutic strategy to restore tumor suppressor function. Orally bioavailable selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) that irreversibly bind to CRM1 and block the function of this protein have been recently developed. Here we investigated the antileukemic activity of KPT-SINE (KPT-185 and KPT-276) in vitro and in vivo in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). KPT-185 displayed potent antiproliferative properties at submicromolar concentrations (IC50 values; 100-500 nM), induced apoptosis (average 5-fold increase), cell-cycle arrest, and myeloid differentiation in AML cell lines and patient blasts. A strong down-regulation of the oncogene FLT3 after KPT treatment in both FLT3-ITD and wild-type cell lines was observed. Finally, using the FLT3-ITD-positive MV4-11 xenograft murine model, we show that treatment of mice with oral KPT-276 (analog of KPT-185 for in vivo studies) significantly prolongs survival of leukemic mice (P < .01). In summary, KPT-SINE are highly potent in vitro and in vivo in AML. The preclinical results reported here support clinical trials of KPT-SINE in AML.","['Ranganathan, Parvathi', 'Yu, Xueyan', 'Na, Caroline', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Kauffman, Michael', 'Walker, Alison', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Blum, William', 'Caligiuri, Michael', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Ranganathan P', 'Yu X', 'Na C', 'Santhanam R', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman M', 'Walker A', 'Klisovic R', 'Blum W', 'Caligiuri M', 'Croce CM', 'Marcucci G', 'Garzon R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120607,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3433086,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46453-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-423160 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 30;120(9):1765-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-423160.

Although EZH2 is overexpressed in various cancers, including some hematologic malignancies, the role of EZH2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has yet to be examined in vivo. In the present study, we transformed granulocyte macrophage progenitors from Cre-ERT;Ezh2(flox/flox) mice with the MLL-AF9 leukemic fusion gene to analyze the function of Ezh2 in AML. Deletion of Ezh2 in transformed granulocyte macrophage progenitors compromised growth severely in vitro and attenuated the progression of AML significantly in vivo. Ezh2-deficient leukemic cells developed into a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like disease with a lower frequency of leukemia-initiating cells compared with the control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed a significant reduction in the levels of trimethylation at H3K27 in Ezh2-deficient leukemic cells, not only at Cdkn2a, a known major target of Ezh2, but also at a cohort of genes relevant to the developmental and differentiation processes. Overexpression of Egr1, one of the derepressed genes in Ezh2-deficient leukemic cells, promoted the differentiation of AML cells profoundly. Our findings suggest that Ezh2 inhibits differentiation programs in leukemic stem cells, thereby augmenting their leukemogenic activity.","['Tanaka, Satomi', 'Miyagi, Satoru', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Chiba, Tetsuhiro', 'Yuan, Jin', 'Mochizuki-Kashio, Makiko', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Sugano, Sumio', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Tanaka S', 'Miyagi S', 'Sashida G', 'Chiba T', 'Yuan J', 'Mochizuki-Kashio M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Sugano S', 'Nakaseko C', 'Yokote K', 'Koseki H', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/09 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46560-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-394932 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 2;120(5):1107-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-394932.

Recently, we reported that RUNX1-mediated silencing of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB (MYH10) was required for megakaryocyte ploidization and maturation. Here we demonstrate that runx1 deletion in mice induces the persistence of MYH10 in platelets, and a similar persistence was observed in platelets of patients with constitutional (familial platelet disorder/acute myeloid leukemia) or acquired (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) RUNX1 mutations. MYH10 was also detected in platelets of patients with the Paris-Trousseau syndrome, a thrombocytopenia related to the deletion of the transcription factor FLI1 that forms a complex with RUNX1 to regulate megakaryopoiesis, whereas MYH10 persistence was not observed in other inherited forms of thrombocytopenia.

The hOCT1 gene is transactivated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha in human liver, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma activation increases OCT1 expression in mouse hepatocytes. Here we report that no isoform of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha is expressed in CML lines or in CML primary cells. In contrast, both PPARalpha and gamma were expressed in all CML cell lines and primary cells studied. PPARalpha agonist treatment increased imatinib killing of CML KCL22 cells and primitive CD34(+) cells, and also upregulates hOCT1 gene expression and increases imatinib uptake into KCL22 cells and primary cells.

Further validation of Erythroid Kruppel-like Factor (EKLF) mRNA expression as a prognostic factor was assessed.We evaluated GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1), GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2), EKLF and Myeloproliferative Leukemia virus oncogen homology (cMPL) gene mRNA expression in the bone marrow of 65 AML patients at diagnosis, and assessed any correlation with NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA mutations. EKLF-positive AML was associated with lower WBC in peripheral blood (P = 0.049), a higher percentage of erythroblasts in bone marrow (p = 0.057), and secondary AMLs (P = 0.036). High expression levels of EKLF showed a trend to association with T-cell antigen expression, such as CD7 (P = 0.057). Patients expressing EKLF had longer Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survival (EFS) than those patients not expressing EKLF (median OS was 35.61 months and 19.31 months, respectively, P = 0.0241; median EFS was 19.80 months and 8.03 months, respectively, P = 0.0140). No correlation of GATA1, GATA2, EKLF and cMPL levels was observed with FLT-3 or NPM1 mutation status. Four of four CEBPA mutated AMLs were EKLF positive versus 10 of 29 CEBPA wild-type AMLs; three of the CEBPA mutated, EKLF-positive AMLs were also GATA2 positive. There were no cases of CEBPA mutations in the EKLF-negative AML group.

This might be attributable to increased natural killing by allogeneic NK cells carrying a KIR that does not bind to HLA-C on target cells (HLA-C-uncoupled KIR). Considering a new strategy of allogeneic NK cell transfer with rituximab to treat B-cell lymphomas, however, it is unknown whether the HLA-C matching status also affects rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). To address this issue, we investigated the levels of ADCC by purified NK cells carrying an HLA-C-uncoupled KIR, where the NK cell donors had either matched or mismatched HLA-C combination with target cells. Purified NK cells carrying an HLA-C-uncoupled KIR consistently showed enhanced ADCC against target cells when NK cell donors had an HLA-C-mismatch. When NK cell donors did not have an HLA-C mismatch, it was inconsistent whether HLA-C-uncoupled KIR caused ADCC enhancement. When the levels of ADCC by whole NK cells were compared, there were substantial differences among the donors regardless of the HLA-C matching status. Subjects with HLA-C mismatch may not have an advantage when cytoimmunotherapy using allogeneic NK cells is considered in combination with rituximab.","['Machino, Takayuki', 'Okoshi, Yasushi', 'Miyake, Yasuyuki', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Machino T', 'Okoshi Y', 'Miyake Y', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Chiba S']","['Department of Hematology, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120608,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,,2012/06/09 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/06/09 06:00'],"['2012/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08820139.2012.691148 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2012;41(8):831-46. doi: 10.3109/08820139.2012.691148.

Depletion of LSK cells by radiation or the cytotoxic chemical 5-fluorouracil results in an expansion of the LSK(-) population. In contrast, the LSK(-) population is reduced in CML mice, and depletion of leukemia stem cells (LSCs; BCR-ABL-expressing HSCs) by deleting Alox5 or by inhibiting heat shock protein 90 causes an increase in this LSK(-) population. The transition of LSK to LSK(-) cells is controlled by the Icsbp gene and its downstream gene Lyn, and regulation of this cellular transition is critical for the survival of normal LSK cells and LSCs. These results indicate a potential function of the LSK(-) cells in the regulation of LSK cells and LSCs.","['Peng, Cong', 'Chen, Yaoyu', 'Shan, Yi', 'Zhang, Haojian', 'Guo, Zhiru', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Peng C', 'Chen Y', 'Shan Y', 'Zhang H', 'Guo Z', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3366951,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0038614 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13365 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e38614. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038614.

Increasing access to sequencing technology, including bench-top sequencers, provide the opportunity to re-sequence a limited set of cancer genes across a patient cohort with limited processing time. Here, we re-sequenced a set of cancer genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using Nimblegen sequence capture coupled with Roche/454 technology. First, we investigated how a maximal sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection can be achieved through a benchmark study. We tested nine combinations of different mapping and variant-calling methods, varied the variant calling parameters, and compared the predicted mutations with a large independent validation set obtained by capillary re-sequencing. We found that the combination of two mapping algorithms, namely BWA-SW and SSAHA2, coupled with the variant calling algorithm Atlas-SNP2 yields the highest sensitivity (95%) and the highest specificity (93%). Next, we applied this analysis pipeline to identify mutations in a set of 58 cancer genes, in a panel of 18 T-ALL cell lines and 15 T-ALL patient samples. We confirmed mutations in known T-ALL drivers, including PHF6, NF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN. Interestingly, we also found mutations in several cancer genes that had not been linked to T-ALL before, including JAK3. Finally, we re-sequenced a small set of 39 candidate genes and identified recurrent mutations in TET1, SPRY3 and SPRY4. In conclusion, we established an optimized analysis pipeline for Roche/454 data that can be applied to accurately detect gene mutations in cancer, which led to the identification of several new candidate T-ALL driver mutations.","['Kalender Atak, Zeynep', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Vandepoel, Roel', 'Pauwels, Daphnie', 'Porcu, Michael', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Brys, Vanessa', 'Dirks, Willy G', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Cuppens, Harry', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Cools, Jan', 'Aerts, Stein']","['Kalender Atak Z', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Gianfelici V', 'Geerdens E', 'Vandepoel R', 'Pauwels D', 'Porcu M', 'Lahortiga I', 'Brys V', 'Dirks WG', 'Quentmeier H', 'Cloos J', 'Cuppens H', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Cools J', 'Aerts S']","['Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3366948,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0038463 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e38463. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038463.

IDH2 acts in the forward Krebs cycle as an NADP(+)-consuming enzyme, providing NADPH for maintenance of the reduced glutathione and peroxiredoxin systems and for self-maintenance by reactivation of cystine-inactivated IDH2 by glutaredoxin 2. In highly respiring cells, the resulting NAD(+) accumulation then induces sirtuin-3-mediated activating IDH2 deacetylation, thus increasing its protective function. Reductive carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate by IDH2 (in the reverse Krebs cycle direction), which consumes NADPH, may follow glutaminolysis of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate in cancer cells. When the reverse aconitase reaction and citrate efflux are added, this overall ""anoxic"" glutaminolysis mode may help highly malignant tumors survive aglycemia during hypoxia. Intermittent glycolysis would hypothetically be required to provide ATP. When oxidative phosphorylation is dormant, this mode causes substantial oxidative stress. Arg172 mutants of human IDH2-frequently found with similar mutants of cytosolic IDH1 in grade 2 and 3 gliomas, secondary glioblastomas, and acute myeloid leukemia-catalyze reductive carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate and reduction to D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which strengthens the neoplastic phenotype by competitive inhibition of histone demethylation and 5-methylcytosine hydroxylation, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alternations. D-2-hydroxyglutarate also interferes with proline hydroxylation and thus may stabilize hypoxia-induced factor alpha.","['Smolkova, Katarina', 'Jezek, Petr']","['Smolkova K', 'Jezek P']","['Department of Membrane Transport Biophysics (No. 75), Institute of Physiology v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, CZ-14220 Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120520,United States,Int J Cell Biol,International journal of cell biology,101517861,PMC3363418,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/06/08 06:01,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/273947 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Biol. 2012;2012:273947. doi: 10.1155/2012/273947.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cryopreserved blood mononuclear cells from 278 patients entering the LRF CLL4 trial comparing chlorambucil, fludarabine, and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide were analyzed for ATM-p53-p21 pathway defects using an ex vivo functional assay that uses ionizing radiation to activate ATM and flow cytometry to measure upregulation of p53 and p21 proteins. Clinical endpoints were compared between groups of patients defined by their pathway status. RESULTS: ATM-p53-p21 pathway defects of four different types (A, B, C, and D) were identified in 194 of 278 (70%) samples. The type A defect (high constitutive p53 expression combined with impaired p21 upregulation) and the type C defect (impaired p21 upregulation despite an intact p53 response) were each associated with short progression-free survival. The type A defect was associated with chemoresistance, whereas the type C defect was associated with early relapse. As expected, the type A defect was strongly associated with TP53 deletion/mutation. In contrast, the type C defect was not associated with any of the other prognostic factors examined, including TP53/ATM deletion, TP53 mutation, and IGHV mutational status. Detection of the type C defect added to the prognostic information provided by TP53/ATM deletion, TP53 mutation, and IGHV status. CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate blockade of the ATM-p53-p21 pathway at the level of p21 as a hitherto unrecognized determinant of early disease recurrence following successful cytoreduction.","['Lin, Ke', 'Adamson, Janet', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Carter, Anthony', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Richards, Sue', 'Gonzalez, David', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Oscier, David G', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Lin K', 'Adamson J', 'Johnson GG', 'Carter A', 'Oates M', 'Wade R', 'Richards S', 'Gonzalez D', 'Matutes E', 'Dearden C', 'Oscier DG', 'Catovsky D', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_U137686856/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C18029/A10004/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2936 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2936 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 1;18(15):4191-200. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2936.

Physical examination was unremarkable. Viral infection was suspected and Epstein-Barr virus serology confirmed acute infectious mononucleosis. During admission, she gradually developed pancytopenia and liver enzyme abnormalities. The patient clinically deteriorated with persisting fever, orthostatic hypotension and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow examination showed haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was started and patient recovered quickly. Ferritin decreased immediately, fever resolved within 3 days, viral clearance was reached within 3 weeks. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered off in three months. The Histiocyte Society recommends immunochemotherapy with steroids, etoposide and cyclosporine. Potential side effects of etoposide are severe bone marrow depression and leukaemia. Our patient survived on corticosteroids alone. Early recognition of HLH and prompt treatment are of utmost importance for survival.

Although several types of ERVs are present in domestic cats, infectious ERVs have not been demonstrated. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized class of endogenous gammaretroviruses, termed ERV-DCs, that is present and hereditary in the domestic cat genome. We have characterized a subset of ERV-DC proviral clones, which are numbered according to their genomic insertions. One of these, ERV-DC10, located in the q12-q21 region on chromosome C1, is an infectious gammaretrovirus capable of infecting a broad range of cells, including human. Our studies indicate that ERV-DC10 entered the genome of domestic cats in the recent past and appeared to translocate to or reintegrate at a distinct locus as infectious ERV-DC18. Insertional polymorphism analysis revealed that 92 of 244 domestic cats had ERV-DC10 on a homozygous or heterozygous locus. ERV-DC-like sequences were found in primate and rodent genomes, suggesting that these ERVs, and recombinant viruses such as RD-114 and BaEV, originated from an ancestor of ERV-DC. We also found that a novel recombinant virus, feline leukemia virus subgroup D (FeLV-D), was generated by ERV-DC env transduction into feline leukemia virus in domestic cats. Our results indicate that ERV-DCs behave as donors and/or acceptors in the generation of infectious, recombinant viruses. The presence of such infectious endogenous retroviruses, which could be harmful or beneficial to the host, may affect veterinary medicine and public health.","['Anai, Yukari', 'Ochi, Haruyo', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Nakagawa, So', 'Kawamura, Maki', 'Gojobori, Takashi', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Anai Y', 'Ochi H', 'Watanabe S', 'Nakagawa S', 'Kawamura M', 'Gojobori T', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3421742,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00280-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00280-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Aug;86(16):8634-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00280-12.

Recent data from the Intergroup Francophone du Myelome, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, and Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell Adulto MM-015 trials suggest that lenalidomide maintenance therapy is associated with a higher incidence of second primary malignancies (SPMs), including both hematologic and solid malignancies. In the present study, we analyzed data from the Total Therapy 2 (TT2) trial, along with the 2 Total Therapy 3 (TT3) trials. TT2 patients were assigned randomly to either a control group (no thalidomide) or to the experimental group (thalidomide during induction, between transplantations, and during consolidation and maintenance). The 2 TT3 trials used thalidomide and bortezomib during induction, before and in consolidation after tandem melphalan-based transplantation; TT3A applied VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) in the first year of maintenance and TD for 2 more years, whereas TT3B used VRD (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) maintenance for 3 years. The cumulative incidence of SPMs did not differ significantly among the TT trial components when measured from enrollment (P = .78) or from initiation of maintenance (P = .82). However, a pairwise comparison of the TT2 arms suggested a lower incidence of hematologic SPMs in the thalidomide maintenance arm (hazard ratio = 0.38; P = .09).

Concurrent presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) is observed in 25% of patients with MLL-PTD AML. However, mice expressing either Mll-PTD or Flt3-ITD do not develop AML, suggesting that 2 mutations are necessary for the AML phenotype. Thus, we generated a mouse expressing both Mll-PTD and Flt3-ITD. Mll(PTD/WT):Flt3(ITD/WT) mice developed acute leukemia with 100% penetrance, at a median of 49 weeks. As in human MLL-PTD and/or the FLT3-ITD AML, mouse blasts exhibited normal cytogenetics, decreased Mll-WT-to-Mll-PTD ratio, loss of the Flt3-WT allele, and increased total Flt3. Highlighting the adverse impact of FLT3-ITD dosage on patient survival, mice with homozygous Flt3-ITD alleles, Mll(PTD/WT):Flt3(ITD/ITD), demonstrated a nearly 30-week reduction in latency to overt AML.

We tested by flow cytometry intracellular expression of the proto-oncogene T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1), as well as membrane and intracellular expression of immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7) in 21 pDCL samples and 61 non-pDC acute leukemia samples [i.e., 14 B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 9 T-ALL and 38 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)]. TCL1 is highly expressed in all pDCL samples while at a statistically lower level in all B-ALL and 34% of AML. Statistical analysis shows that intensity of TCL1 expression is a good marker for differential diagnosis of pDCL versus other acute leukemia (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, [AUC]: 0.96). By contrast, ILT7 positivity is limited to few pDCL samples and cannot be useful for diagnosis purpose. In conclusion, high intracellular intensity of TCL1 expression is currently the best marker for pDC lineage assignment by flow cytometry, which is particularly useful to distinguish pDCL from CD4(+) CD56(+/-) undifferentiated or monoblastic acute leukemia. Thus, intracellular TCL1 detection should be included in acute leukemia diagnosis panels used in hematology laboratories.

Overexpression or mutation of EGFR/ErbB1 gene has been detected in a large number of human solid tumours. According to some previous report, this gene is not expressed in hematological malignancies. However, two recent clinical case reports showed that erlotinib caused complete remission of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-M1 in patients who had both AML-M1 and non-small-cell lung cancer. These results are supported by preclinical studies in which EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have anti-proliferative effects on AML. These findings prompted us to determine whether EGFR is expressed in human AML, through a large-scale screening of both leukaemic cell lines and clinical samples. Our results show that EGFR is expressed by about 33% of human AML (containing M1 to M7 subtypes) and by some human leukaemia cell lines (K562, MEG-01, CEM and SKO-007). Its expression is not limited to certain AML types but has been detected in many leukaemic cells. In addition, EGFR expression was intimately associated with the poor clinical outcomes. Finally, we find that only EGFR-positive leukaemic cells respond to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of cetuximab, the monoclonal antibodies against EGFR.","['Sun, Jun-Zhong', 'Lu, Ying', 'Xu, Yin', 'Liu, Fang', 'Li, Fu-Quan', 'Wang, Quan-Li', 'Wu, Chu-Tse', 'Hu, Xian-Wen', 'Duan, Hai-Feng']","['Sun JZ', 'Lu Y', 'Xu Y', 'Liu F', 'Li FQ', 'Wang QL', 'Wu CT', 'Hu XW', 'Duan HF']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110823,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1002 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jun;30(2):89-97. doi: 10.1002/hon.1002.

Recently, multiple mutations have been identified in association with MDS-to-sAMLtransition, but it is still unclear whether all these mutations are necessary for transformation. If multiple independent mutations are required for the transformation, sAML risk should increase with time from MDS diagnosis. In contrast, if a single critical biological event determines sAML transformation; its risk should be constant in time elapsing from MDS diagnosis. To elucidate this question, we studied a database of 1079 patients with MDS. We classified patients according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), using either the French-American-British (FAB) or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and statistically analyzed the resulting transformation risk curves of each group. The risk of transformation after MDS diagnosis remained constant in time within three out of four risk groups, and in all four risk groups, when patients were classified according to FAB or to the WHO-determined criteria, respectively. Further subdivision by blast percentage or cytogenetics had no influence on this result. Our analysis suggests that a single random biological event leads to transformation to sAML, thus calling for the exclusion of time since MDS diagnosis from the clinical decision-making process.","['Shukron, Ofir', 'Vainstein, Vladimir', 'Kundgen, Andrea', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Agur, Zvia']","['Shukron O', 'Vainstein V', 'Kundgen A', 'Germing U', 'Agur Z']","['Institute for Medical Biomathematics (IMBM), Bene Ataroth, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120603,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23257 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Sep;87(9):853-60. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23257.

However, limited data exist regarding the whole transcriptional landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL). In this pilot-study, we evaluated RNA-sequencing in CLL by comparing two subsets which carry almost identical or ""stereotyped"" B-cell receptors with distinct clinical outcome, that is the poor-prognostic subset #1 (n 5 4) and the more favorable-prognostic subset #4(n 5 4). Our analysis revealed that 156 genes (e.g. LPL, WNT9A) and 76 ncRNAs, (e.g. SNORD48, SNORD115) were differentially expressed between the subsets. This technology also enabled us to identify numerous subset-specific splice variants (n 5 406), which were predominantly expressed in subset #1, including a splice-isoform of MSI2 with a novel start exon. A further important application of RNA-sequencing was for mutation detection and revealed 16-30 missense mutations per sample; notably many of these changes were found in genes with a strong potential for involvement in CLL pathogenesis, e.g., ATM and NOTCH2.This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of RNA-sequencing for identifying mutations, quantifying gene expression and detecting splicing events, but also highlights the potential such global approaches have to significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind CLL development.","['Mansouri, Larry', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Ameur, Adam', 'Hooper, Sean D', 'Mayrhofer, Markus', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Gyllensten, Ulf', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Mansouri L', 'Gunnarsson R', 'Sutton LA', 'Ameur A', 'Hooper SD', 'Mayrhofer M', 'Juliusson G', 'Isaksson A', 'Gyllensten U', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20120603,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23227 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Jul;87(7):737-40. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23227.

It has been shown that expression of PU.1 is severely impaired in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but the mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. Through bisulfite sequencing, semi-quantitative PCR, and indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques, we found aberrant methylation in the promoter region of transcription factor PU.1 in CML patients both in the chronic and blast crisis phases, as well as in the CML blast K562 cell line. Of these, several CpG sites were more highly methylated in blast crisis than chronic phase, while no methylation of these sites was observed in healthy individuals. Interestingly, CML patients achieved complete cytogenetic remission under imatinib mesylate treatment, but the aberrant methylation status of PU.1 was not reversed. Down-regulation of PU.1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was also observed in association with aberrant methylation. Thus, for the first time, we have revealed a potential epigenetic modification of PU.1 in CML, which may be responsible for the down-regulation of PU.1. These data suggest that aberrant methylation of PU.1 may play a role in CML pathogenesis, and may therefore serve as a useful biomarker and potential target for demethylating drugs.","['Yang, Hui', 'Liang, Hui', 'Yan, Jing-song', 'Tao, Rong', 'Hao, Si-guo', 'Ma, Li-yuan']","['Yang H', 'Liang H', 'Yan JS', 'Tao R', 'Hao SG', 'Ma LY']","['Department of Hematology, Xin Hua Hospital-Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, 1665 Kong Jiang Road, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/11/08 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1106-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Jul;96(1):65-73. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1106-x.

We sought to evaluate the role of genes involved in xenobiotic transport and metabolism in childhood ALL risk, both alone and in conjunction with household chemical exposures previously found to be associated with childhood ALL risk. METHODS: We conducted a population-based epidemiologic study of 377 cases and 448 controls in California, utilizing a haplotype-based approach to evaluate 42 xenobiotic transport and metabolism genes in conjunction with data on self-reported household chemical exposures. RESULTS: We identified significant associations of childhood ALL risk with haplotypes of ABCB1, ARNT, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and IDH1. In addition, certain haplotypes showed significant joint effects with self-reported household chemical exposures on risk of childhood ALL. Specifically, elevated risks associated with use of paints in the home (ever) and indoor insecticides (pre-birth) were limited to subjects carrying specific haplotypes of CYP2C8 and ABCB1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide support for a role of xenobiotic transport and metabolism pathways in risk of childhood ALL and indicate that genes in these pathways may modulate the risk of disease associated with use of common household chemicals.

This study describes the testing and validation of an automated system for capturing and reporting cancers from community oncology providers. METHODS: The system was evaluated in 5 oncology practices in two states processing claims data for a 4- or 8-month interval. Resulting cancers were matched with the state registries. A random sample of nonmatched cases was reabstracted to measure the accuracy of the claims data for reporting of hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: The overall match rate for the 1,935 hematologic malignancies reported during the study period was 58.2 % (range, 37.4 % for CLL to 71.2 % for Hodgkin's Lymphoma). The overall accuracy rate for billing-reported hematologic malignancies was 95 %. Accuracy among cases that did not match with the cancer registry was 88 %. The estimated number of missed cases for the five participating practices ranged from 0.8 leukemia cases/oncologist/year to 3.4 CLL cases/oncologist/year. The estimated total number of missed cases in the five participating practices was 292 with an interquartile range of 263-323. CONCLUSION: As cancer diagnosis and treatment continue migration into ambulatory physician practice settings unreported hematopoietic cases will become increasingly problematic. Leveraging the standardized electronic billing data for automated reporting of cancer cases from physician practices may be an efficient method to reduce this gap in cancer surveillance reporting.","['Penberthy, Lynne', 'McClish, Donna', 'Peace, Steven', 'Gray, Laurel', 'Martin, Jim', 'Overton, Sandra', 'Radhakrishnan, Soundarya', 'Gillam, Chris', 'Ginder, Gordon']","['Penberthy L', 'McClish D', 'Peace S', 'Gray L', 'Martin J', 'Overton S', 'Radhakrishnan S', 'Gillam C', 'Ginder G']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 730 East Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23296-0308, USA. lpenbert@vcu.edu']",['eng'],['R21 CA127967-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120607,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0003-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Aug;23(8):1253-64. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0003-1.

Both methods use microCT images of trabecular bone (TB) to model spongiosa regions of human bones containing marrow cavities segmented into soft tissue volumes of active marrow (AM), trabecular inactive marrow and the bone endosteum (BE), which is a 50 microm thick layer of marrow on all TB surfaces and on cortical bone surfaces next to TB as well as inside the medullary cavities. With respect to the radiation absorbed dose, the AM and the BE are sensitive soft tissues for the induction of leukaemia and bone cancer, respectively. The two methods differ mainly with respect to the number of bone sites and the size of the microCT images used in Monte Carlo calculations and they apply different methods to simulate exposure from radiation sources located outside the skeleton. The PIRT method calculates dosimetric quantities in isolated human bones while the SPC method uses human bones embedded in the body of a phantom which contains all relevant organs and soft tissues. Consequently, the SPC method calculates absorbed dose to the AM and to the BE from particles emitted by radionuclides concentrated in organs or from radiation sources located outside the human body in one calculation step. In order to allow for similar calculations of AM and BE absorbed doses using the PIRT method, the so-called dose response functions (DRFs) have been developed based on absorbed fractions (AFs) of energy for electrons isotropically emitted in skeletal tissues. The DRFs can be used to transform the photon fluence in homogeneous spongiosa regions into absorbed dose to AM and BE. This paper will compare AM and BE AFs of energy from electrons emitted in skeletal tissues calculated with the SPC and the PIRT method and AM and BE absorbed doses and AFs calculated with PIRT-based DRFs and with the SPC method. The results calculated with the two skeletal dosimetry methods agree well if one takes the differences between the two models properly into account. Additionally, the SPC method will be updated with larger microCT images of TB.","['Kramer, R', 'Cassola, V F', 'Vieira, J W', 'Khoury, H J', 'de Oliveira Lira, C A B', 'Robson Brown, K']","['Kramer R', 'Cassola VF', 'Vieira JW', 'Khoury HJ', 'de Oliveira Lira CA', 'Robson Brown K']","['Department of Nuclear Energy, Federal University of Pernambuco, Avenida Professor Luiz Freire 1000, CEP 50740-540, Recife, Brazil. rkramer@uol.com.br']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/10/05 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/57/12/3995 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 2012 Jun 21;57(12):3995-4021. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/57/12/3995.,20121004,10.1088/0031-9155/57/12/3995 [doi],,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone and Bones/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Radiometry/*methods', '*X-Ray Microtomography']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, the impact of age relative to that of other prognostic factors on the outcome of patients treated in recent trials is unknown. METHODS: Clinical outcome and causes of treatment failure of 351 patients enrolled on 3 consecutive protocols for childhood AML between 1991 and 2008 were analyzed according to age and protocol. RESULTS: The more recent protocol (AML02) produced improved outcomes for patients aged 10 years to 21 years compared with 2 earlier studies (AML91 and AML97), with 3-year rates of event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence of refractory leukemia or recurrence (CIR) for this group being similar to those of patients aged birth to 9 years: EFS: 58.3% +/- 5.4% versus 66.6% +/- 4.9% (P = .20); OS: 68.9% +/- 5.1% versus 75.1% +/- 4.5% (P = .36); and CIR: 21.9% +/- 4.4% versus 25.3% +/- 4.2% (P = .59). The EFS and OS estimates for patients aged 10 to 15 years overlapped those for patients aged 16 to 21 years. However, the cumulative incidence of toxic death was significantly higher for patients aged 10 to 21 years compared with younger patients (13.2% +/- 3.6% vs 4.5% +/- 2.0%; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate for older children with AML has improved on the results of a recent trial and is now similar to that of younger patients. However, deaths from toxicity remain a significant problem for patients in the older age group. Future trials should focus on improving supportive care while striving to develop more effective antileukemic therapy.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Jenkins, Laura', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Campana, Dario', 'Inaba, Hiroto']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Pounds S', 'Cao X', 'Jenkins L', 'Dahl G', 'Bowman WP', 'Taub JW', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Campana D', 'Inaba H']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC3557958,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27659 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;118(24):6253-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27659.

Description of the clinical symptoms and neuroimaging findings].,712-8,"INTRODUCTION. High-dose methotrexate (MTX) has showed to increase the surveillance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other neoplasms. However, MTX may induce significant neurotoxicity. AIM. To evaluate, in our population of patients who have been treated with MTX, the incidence of neurotoxicity and to describe its main clinical and radiological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We retrospectively review the patients who received treatment with systemic high-dose MTX and/or intrathecal MTX between 1994 and 2010. The children who presented clinical o radiological signs of neurotoxicity were reviewed. RESULTS. We identified 284 patients who received high-dose intravenous and/or intrathecal MTX. 9 patients presented neurotoxicity. The median age at diagnosis was 6 years; 6 patients were male. The diagnosis included: 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 medulloblastoma and 1 lymphoma. 66% patients presented focal neurological dysfunction, 3 had non-specific symptoms. In 5 patients the symptomatology started the first 14 days after the MTX administration. 8 patients had complete clinical resolution, but only one presented neurological long term effects. All the patients except one showed signs of acute leukoencephalopathy in the brain MR study. These alterations resolved one year later in 3 patients; in the other patients the MR alterations persisted. The neurotoxicity management was corticosteroid, folinic acid, aminophylline and dextromethorphan. CONCLUSION. The MTX neurotoxicity it can present as acute or chronic. It has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from sub-clinical manifestations with complete recovery to a chronic and progressive encephalopathy.","['Garcia-Puig, Montserrat', 'Fons-Estupina, M Carmen', 'Rives-Sola, Susana', 'Berrueco-Moreno, Ruben', 'Cruz-Martinez, Ofelia', 'Campistol, Jaume']","['Garcia-Puig M', 'Fons-Estupina MC', 'Rives-Sola S', 'Berrueco-Moreno R', 'Cruz-Martinez O', 'Campistol J']","['Servicio de Neurologia, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain. mgarciap@tauli.cat']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,,2012/06/08 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['rn2012005 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Neurol. 2012 Jun 16;54(12):712-8.,20121113,,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,Neurotoxicidad por metotrexato en pacientes pediatricos.

Flow cytometry studies were performed on blood, spleen and thymus samples and correlated with gross morphology and histological changes, resulting from the development of lymphoma. Infected animals with lymphoma had significant decreases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts in blood and spleen compared with controls. The spleens of infected animals without lymphoma showed a decrease in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts, but this was not significant compared with controls. In the thymus, CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts also decreased, but this was not significant in infected animals with and without lymphoma compared with controls. Markers of myeloid cell dysfunction increased in the thymus of animals with infection with and without lymphoma compared with controls.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors, aberrant and constitutively active NOTCH1 signaling triggered by activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene contributes to oncogenic transformation and is a hallmark of this disease. Most notably, small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) can effectively block NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL, and could be exploited as a targeted therapy in this disease. In addition, a number of emerging anti-NOTCH therapeutic strategies including anti-NOTCH1 inhibitory antibodies, small peptide inhibitors of NOTCH signaling and combination therapies with GSIs and glucocorticoids, have recently been proposed. Finally, the identification of NOTCH1 mutations in solid tumors and chronic lymphocytic leukemias has increased even further the clinical relevance of NOTCH signaling as a therapeutic target in human cancer.

We also demonstrate that UDP-glucose promotes rapid, robust, and concentration-dependent activation of RhoA in these cells. Ecto-nucleotidases expressed on neutrophils rapidly hydrolyzed extracellular ATP, but incubation with UDP-glucose for up to 1 h resulted in negligible metabolism of the nucleotide-sugar. HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells do not express the P2Y(14)-R, but neutrophil differentiation of HL60 cells with DMSO resulted in markedly enhanced P2Y(14)-R expression. Accordingly, UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine promoted Rho activation in differentiated but not in undifferentiated HL60 cells. Stable expression of recombinant human P2Y(14)-R conferred UDP-sugar-promoted responses to undifferentiated HL60 cells. UDP-glucose-promoted RhoA activation also was accompanied by enhanced cell migration in differentiated HL60 cells, and these responses were blocked by Rho kinase inhibitors. These results support the notion that UDP-glucose is a stable and potent proinflammatory mediator that promotes P2Y(14)-R-mediated neutrophil motility via Rho/Rho kinase activation.","['Sesma, Juliana I', 'Kreda, Silvia M', 'Steinckwich-Besancon, Natacha', 'Dang, Hong', 'Garcia-Mata, Rafael', 'Harden, T Kendall', 'Lazarowski, Eduardo R']","['Sesma JI', 'Kreda SM', 'Steinckwich-Besancon N', 'Dang H', 'Garcia-Mata R', 'Harden TK', 'Lazarowski ER']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7248, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM-38123/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HL-0343223/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120606,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

One hypothesis is that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide serves as a specific stimulus for tyrosine kinase-based microglial activation leading to pro-inflammatory changes that contribute to disease. Therefore, inhibiting Abeta stimulation of microglia may prove to be an important therapeutic strategy for AD. METHODS: Primary murine microglia cultures and the murine microglia cell line, BV2, were used for stimulation with fibrillar Abeta1-42. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, was used to treat the cells to determine whether Src family kinase activity was required for the Abeta stimulated signaling response and subsequent increase in TNFalpha secretion using Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. A histologic longitudinal analysis was performed using an AD transgenic mouse model, APP/PS1, to determine an age at which microglial protein tyrosine kinase levels increased in order to administer dasatinib via mini osmotic pump diffusion. Effects of dasatinib administration on microglial and astroglial activation, protein phosphotyrosine levels, active Src kinase levels, Abeta plaque deposition, and spatial working memory were assessed via immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and T maze analysis. RESULTS: Abeta fibrils stimulated primary murine microglia via a tyrosine kinase pathway involving Src kinase that was attenuated by dasatinib. Dasatinib administration to APP/PS1 mice decreased protein phosphotyrosine, active Src, reactive microglia, and TNFalpha levels in the hippocampus and temporal cortex. The drug had no effect on GFAP levels, Abeta plaque load, or the related tyrosine kinase, Lyn. These anti-inflammatory changes correlated with improved performance on the T maze test in dasatinib infused animals compared to control animals. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that amyloid dependent microgliosis may be Src kinase dependent in vitro and in vivo. This study defines a role for Src kinase in the microgliosis characteristic of diseased brains and suggests that particular tyrosine kinase inhibition may be a valid anti-inflammatory approach to disease. Dasatinib is an FDA-approved drug for treating chronic myeloid leukemia cancer with a reported ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, this suggests a novel use for this drug as well as similar acting molecules.","['Dhawan, Gunjan', 'Combs, Colin K']","['Dhawan G', 'Combs CK']","['School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 504 Hamline St, Room 118, Grand Forks, ND 58203, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AG026330/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AG026330/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120702,England,J Neuroinflammation,Journal of neuroinflammation,101222974,PMC3388011,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-2094-9-117 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-2094-9-117 [doi]']",epublish,J Neuroinflammation. 2012 Jul 2;9:117. doi: 10.1186/1742-2094-9-117.,20130117,10.1186/1742-2094-9-117 [doi],,,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-42))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microglia/drug effects/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic silencing of pathway inhibitor genes may be a mechanism for its activation. In this study, we investigated systematically and quantitatively the methylation status of 12 Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor genes - CDH1, DACT1, DKK1, DKK2, DKK3, DKK4, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP3, SFRP4, SFRP5 and WIF1 - in the cell lines EHEB and MEC-1 as well as patient samples. METHODS: Quantification of DNA methylation was performed by means of bisulphite pyrosequencing and confirmed by bisulphite Sanger sequencing. Gene expression was analysed by qPCR using GAPDH as internal control. E-cadherin and beta-catenin protein quantification was carried out by microsphere-based immunoassays. Methylation differences observed between the patient and control groups were tested using generalised least squares models. RESULTS: For 10 genes, a higher methylation level was observed in tumour material. Only DKK4 exhibited similarly high methylation levels in both tumour and normal specimens, while DACT1 was always essentially unmethylated. However, also for these inhibitors, treatment of cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine resulted in an induction of their expression, as shown by quantitative PCR, suggesting an indirect epigenetic control of activity. While the degree of demethylation and its transcriptional consequences differed between the genes, there was an overall high correlation of demethylation and increased activity. Protein expression studies revealed that no constitutive Wnt/beta-catenin signalling occurred in the cell lines, which is in discrepancy with results from primary CLL. However, treatment with 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine caused accumulation of beta-catenin. Simultaneously, E-cadherin expression was strongly induced, leading to the formation of a complex with beta-catenin and thus demonstrating its epigenetically regulated inhibition effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest an epigenetic silencing mechanism of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor genes in CLL. Hypermethylation and silencing of functionally related genes may not be completely stochastic but result from the tumour epigenome reprogramming orchestrated by Polycomb-group repressive complexes. The data are of interest in the context of epigenetic-based therapy.","['Moskalev, Evgeny A', 'Luckert, Katrin', 'Vorobjev, Ivan A', 'Mastitsky, Sergey E', 'Gladkikh, Aleena A', 'Stephan, Achim', 'Schrenk, Marita', 'Kaplanov, Kamil D', 'Kalashnikova, Olga B', 'Potz, Oliver', 'Joos, Thomas O', 'Hoheisel, Jorg D']","['Moskalev EA', 'Luckert K', 'Vorobjev IA', 'Mastitsky SE', 'Gladkikh AA', 'Stephan A', 'Schrenk M', 'Kaplanov KD', 'Kalashnikova OB', 'Potz O', 'Joos TO', 'Hoheisel JD']","['Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany. evgeny.moskalev@uk-erlangen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC3489542,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-213 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-213 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Jun 6;12:213. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-213.,20130617,10.1186/1471-2407-12-213 [doi],,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The requirement of highly specialized tests for diagnosis represents a particular problem in resource-limited settings. To overcome this difficulty, we applied a diagnostic algorithm and developed a collaboration program with a specialized international center in order to increase the diagnostic yield in a cohort of patients in Argentina. METHODS: Based on the algorithm, initial evaluation included collection of clinical data, platelet size, blood smear examination and platelet aggregation tests. Confirmatory tests were performed according to diagnostic suspicion, which included platelet glycoprotein expression, immunofluorescence for myosin-9 in granulocytes and platelet thrombospondin-1 and molecular screening of candidate genes. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients from 14 pedigrees were included; their median age was 32 (4-72) years and platelet count 72 (4-147)x10(9) L(-1). Autosomal dominant inheritance was found in nine (64%) pedigrees; 10 (71%) had large platelets and nine (29%) patients presented with syndromic forms.

This tumor-specific apoptotic characteristic of the protein potentially may allow the development of a protein drug that has applications in tumor therapy. However, several major problems, which include poor expression and poor protein solubility, have hampered the production of apoptin in bacteria. RESULTS: Significantly increased expression of recombinant full-length apoptin that originated from chicken anemia virus was demonstrated using an E. coli expression system. The CAV VP3 gene was fused with a synthetic sequence containing a trans-acting activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain (PTD). The resulting construct was cloned into various different expression vectors and these were then expressed in various E. coli strains. The expression of the TAT-Apoptin in E. coli was significantly increased when TAT-Apoptin was fused with GST-tag rather than a His-tag. When the various rare amino acid codons of apoptin were optimized, the expression level of the GST-TAT-Apoptin(opt) in E. coli BL21(DE3) was significantly further increased. The highest protein expression level obtained was 8.33 g/L per liter of bacterial culture after induction with 0.1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 25 degrees C. Moreover, approximately 90% of the expressed GST-TAT-Apoptin(opt) under these conditions was soluble. After purification by GST affinity chromatography, the purified recombinant TAT-Apoptin(opt) protein was used to evaluate the recombinant protein's apoptotic activity on tumor cells. The results demonstrated that the E. coli-expressed GST-TAT-apoptin(opt) showed apoptotic activity and was able to induce human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells to enter apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: On expression in E. coli, purified recombinant TAT-Apoptin(opt) that has been fused to a GST tag and had its codons optimized, was found to have great potential. This protein may in the future allow the development of a therapeutic protein that is able to specifically kill tumor cells.","['Lee, Meng-Shiou', 'Sun, Fang-Chun', 'Huang, Chi-Hung', 'Lien, Yi-Yang', 'Feng, Shin-Huei', 'Lai, Guan-Hua', 'Lee, Meng-Shiunn', 'Chao, Jung', 'Chen, Hsi-Jien', 'Tzen, Jason T C', 'Cheng, Hao-Yuan']","['Lee MS', 'Sun FC', 'Huang CH', 'Lien YY', 'Feng SH', 'Lai GH', 'Lee MS', 'Chao J', 'Chen HJ', 'Tzen JT', 'Cheng HY']","['School of Chinese Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chinese Medicine Resources, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,PMC3443062,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6750-12-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-12-27 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2012 Jun 6;12:27. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-12-27.,20130122,10.1186/1472-6750-12-27 [doi],,,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (VP3 protein, Chicken anemia virus)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chicken anemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Codon', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', '*Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of WT1 from quantitative and morphological perspectives in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most widespread malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity. METHODS: Six OSCC cell lines and tissue sections from 29 OSCC patients were analyzed. To detect WT1 expression, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, Western blots, and immunofluorescence flow cytometry for WT1 were performed on the cell lines, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed on the tissue sections. RESULTS: WT1 mRNA was found overexpressed in one of the six OSCC cell lines, with expression levels higher than that seen in human leukemia cell line (K562). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections showed overexpression of WT1 protein in two patients, concentrated mainly in the cytoplasm of the outer one to three cell layers of the cancer nests. This was consistent with the expression of WT1 mRNA observed by FISH. Meanwhile, WT1 was not detected on normal oral epithelium. WT1 protein was detected on actively proliferating cancer nests and even on elongated epithelial ridge where new droplet-cancer-nests were being formed and starting infiltration toward subepithelial layer. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that WT1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of some types of OSCC, particularly in proliferation of the cancer cells.","['Mikami, Toshinari', 'Hada, Tomohiro', 'Chosa, Naoyuki', 'Ishisaki, Akira', 'Mizuki, Harumi', 'Takeda, Yasunori']","['Mikami T', 'Hada T', 'Chosa N', 'Ishisaki A', 'Mizuki H', 'Takeda Y']","['Division of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Iwate Medical University, Iwate, Japan. toshi_m@sea.plala.or.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120605,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01182.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2013 Feb;42(2):133-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01182.x.

Here, we determined the frequency of genome-wide cytogenetic CNV aberrations in Korean patients with normal karyotype (NK) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and tested whether these genomic variations contribute to differences in Ara-C and anthracycline-based chemotherapy responses. Bone marrow aspirates and blood from 30 previously untreated de novo NK-AML patients were provided at the time of diagnosis for copy number analysis. Possible associations between cytogenetic aberrations and clinical parameters were analysed. CNVs were identified in 23 (76.7%) of the 30 cases tested. Multivariate analyses controlled for other clinical co-variates showed that patients having copy number loss had a decreased probability of complete remission (OR, 0.015 [95% CI, 0-0.737], p = 0.035). Patients who had a copy number gain of more than four regions tended to have shorter event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.083) with multivariate analysis showing that CNV increase is an independent predictive factor for shorter EFS (HR, 22.104 [95% CI, 1.644-297.157], p = 0.020). In addition, we identified candidate genes that may be involved in Ara-C and anthracycline drug response in Korean patients with NK-AML. These results suggest that CNVs may affect the success of Ara-C and anthracycline-based chemotherapy in Korean patients with NK-AML.","['Kim, Kyung Im', 'Kim, Tae-Kyung', 'Kim, In-Wha', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Shin, Wan Gyoon', 'Oh, Jung Mi']","['Kim KI', 'Kim TK', 'Kim IW', 'Ahn KS', 'Yoon SS', 'Shin WG', 'Oh JM']","['College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120629,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-7843.2012.00904.x [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2012 Nov;111(5):317-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2012.00904.x.

One useful technique in this respect is the gene expression profiling, whose use is not yet a matter of routine. The discovery that the expression of LDL-receptor and cholesterol synthesis is increased in the cells of some leukemias and lymphomas and that some statins induced DNA damages and increased the level of reactive oxygen species, opens the possibility of using statins in the treatment of certain malignant hemopathies. Patents regarding their association with dipyridamole, retinoids, tipifarnib, cytostatics or chemotherapy programs contribute to increasing their effectiveness. Statins can increase the apoptosis of malignant cells and restore the chemosensitivity in patients with different malignant hemopathies. Techniques of molecular biology are useful for identifying patients who have indication for statins. The main adverse effects of statins are increased transaminase levels and myopathy. The last may be anticipated and treated today.","['Mihaila, Romeo-Gabriel']",['Mihaila RG'],"['Clinica Medicala II, Spitalul Clinic Judetean, B-dul Corneliu Coposu, Nr 2-4, 2400 Sibiu, Romania. romeomihaila@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat DNA Gene Seq,Recent patents on DNA & gene sequences,101299745,,2012/06/08 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2012/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['DNAG-EPUB-20120605-2 [pii]', '10.2174/1872215611307010008 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat DNA Gene Seq. 2013 Apr 1;7(1):57-61. doi: 10.2174/1872215611307010008.,20130916,,,,['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Biology/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bendamustine is a bifunctional alkylator with unique properties that significantly distinguish it from other agents in its class. In untreated CLL, bendamustine has demonstrated rates of response and progression-free survival (PFS) that are superior to those with chlorambucil, with an acceptable toxicity profile. In the relapsed setting, combination treatment with bendamustine-rituximab (BR) has demonstrated promising activity in high-risk patients such as those refractory to fludarabine or alkylating agents. In untreated patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma, BR has demonstrated a PFS significantly longer than that achieved with R-CHOP (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone), with significantly reduced toxicity. In the relapsed setting, br has demonstrated rates of response and PFS superior to those with fludarabine-rituximab, with comparable toxicity. In the United States and Europe, bendamustine has been approved for the treatment of CLL and indolent NHL; its approval in Canada is pending and eagerly awaited.

Little is known about contribution of NKT cells in cancer initiation and progression. In this study, the frequencies of NKT-like cells, B cells expressing CD1d molecule and CD4(+) regulatory (Treg) cells were analyzed in 40 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 15 healthy subjects by flow cytometry. Our results showed that the frequency of CD3(+)CD56(+) NKT-like cells is significantly decreased in progressive (4.9 +/- 0.8 % of total CD3(+) T cells) compared with indolent (8.1 +/- 1.2 %, p = 0.036) patients and healthy subjects (10.6 +/- 1.7 %, p = 0.003). However, no association was found between NKT-like cell frequency and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation or CD38 and ZAP70 expression. On the other hand, expression of CD1d molecule was significantly higher in leukemic B cells of patients with CLL (75 +/- 1.5 % of total CD19(+) B cells) compared to B cells from healthy subjects (59.6 +/- 2.2 %, p < 0.001), with no significant difference between progressive and indolent patients. Interestingly, the frequency of Treg cells was inversely correlated with that of NKT-like cells in patients with CLL (r = -0.4, p = 0.002).

Using multi-color flow cytometry, we analyzed the proportions of CD34 + CD38- LSCs and expression of CD123, CD44, and CD184 on LSCs in 63 patients with AML. The median proportion of LSCs was 1.3 % (0.0-33.1 %) at the time of diagnosis. Of all patients, 74.6 % of them had CD123-positive LSCs, all patients had CD44-positive LSCs, and 85.7 % had CD184-positive LSCs, respectively. The proportions of LSCs were significantly lower in the complete remission (CR) group compared with non-CR group (P = 0.006).

Imatinib has been the most widely used TKI with several published trials showing it produced better outcomes when combined with chemotherapy. Dasatinib, a more potent inhibitor than imatinib, has also been evaluated with promising results. However, relapses still occur at a high rate, and allogeneic stem cell transplant is considered, so far, a better curative option in first remission.

Vorinostat and MLN8237, a selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, disrupt the spindle assembly and the mitotic checkpoint at different points, suggesting that the combination could have increased antitumor activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of vorinostat and MLN8237 in pediatric tumor cell lines. METHODS: Cell survival was measured after 72 h of drug treatment using a modified methyl tetrazolium assay. For drug combination experiments, cells were exposed to medium alone (controls), single drug alone, or to different concentrations of the combination of the two drugs, for a total of 36 concentration pairs per plate. The interaction of the drug combination was analyzed using the universal response surface approach. RESULTS: The cells express the target of MLN8237, Aurora A. For each cell line, the single agent IC(50) for MLN8237 and for vorinostat was in the clinically relevant range. Both drugs inhibited cell survival in a concentration-dependent fashion. At concentrations of MLN8237 exceeding approximately 1 muM, there was a paradoxical increase in viability signal in all three lines that may be explained by inhibition of Aurora B kinase. The combination of MLN8237 and vorinostat showed additive cytotoxicity in all three cell lines and nearly abrogated the paradoxical increase in survival noted at high single-agent MLN8237 concentrations. CONCLUSION: MLN8237 and vorinostat are active in vitro against cancer cell lines. These results provide important preclinical support for the development of future clinical studies of MLN8237and vorinostat.","['Muscal, Jodi A', 'Scorsone, Kathleen A', 'Zhang, Linna', 'Ecsedy, Jeffrey A', 'Berg, Stacey L']","['Muscal JA', 'Scorsone KA', 'Zhang L', 'Ecsedy JA', 'Berg SL']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates Street, Suite 1220, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jamuscal@txch.org""]",['eng'],"['K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5K12CA90433-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,PMC3655801,2012/06/07 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2012/06/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-012-9831-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Feb;31(1):39-45. doi: 10.1007/s10637-012-9831-9.

Often only a few observations per signal source, i.e. genes, are available. Such scenarios are becoming increasingly more relevant as modern sensing technologies generally have no trouble in measuring lots of channels, but where the number of subjects, such as patients or samples, is limited. In statistics, this problem falls under the heading 'large p, small n'. Moreover, in such situations the use of asymptotic analytical results should generally be mistrusted. RESULTS: We consider two cancer datasets, with the aim to mine the activity of functional groups of genes. We propose a hierarchical model with two layers in which the individual signals share a common variance component. A likelihood ratio test is defined for the difference between two collections of corresponding signals. The small number of observations requires a careful consideration of the bias of the statistic, which is corrected through an explicit Bartlett correction. The test is validated on Monte Carlo simulations, which show improved detection of differences compared with other methods. In a leukaemia study and a cancerous fibroblast cell line, we find that the method also works better in practice, i.e. it gives a richer picture of the underlying biology.

This complex network of cell-to-cell signals in the microenvironment involves both cell contact-mediated and paracrine cues. In hematological malignancies the intricate balance is, however, disrupted to support cancer progression. In order to detect altered microenvironmental reactivity of a hematopoietic cell sample, cellular functional assays can be designed to measure the cells' capacity to modulate stromal stress reactions, such as inflammation.Recently, we showed that human leukemic cell lines of monocytic origin can actively participate in modulation of stromal inflammation. In order to further functionally evaluate the hematopoietic cells' capacity to modulate stromal inflammation, we utilized an in vitro model of nemosis-induced inflammation of fibroblasts in a three-dimensional culture setting. This process of stromal inflammation in fibroblast aggregates is consistent, requires both cell-contact and paracrine signals, and can be produced on a large scale to support dose-dependent analyses. To extend our previous observations, we evaluated the effect of a wide panel of leukemia cell lines on cyclooxygenase- 2 induction in fibroblast aggregates in co-culture. We also assessed the feasibility of the model to support clinical functional testing by utilizing the hematopoietic fraction of leukemia patients' bone marrow aspirates after immunophenotyping. Our results suggest that the stromal inflammation-modulating activity of these samples is differently modulated in cancer and in normal bone marrow. Moreover, differences in the samples' anti-inflammatory activity may reflect disease state.","['Egyudova, K', 'Fajtova, M', 'Cizmar, A', 'Korhonen, M', 'Gyarfas, J', 'Kankuri, E', 'Bizik, J']","['Egyudova K', 'Fajtova M', 'Cizmar A', 'Korhonen M', 'Gyarfas J', 'Kankuri E', 'Bizik J']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia. katarina.egyudova@savba.sk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,2012/06/07 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2012_074 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2012;59(5):574-83. doi: 10.4149/neo_2012_074.,20120927,10.4149/neo_2012_074 [doi],,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Dermis/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells/enzymology/immunology/pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMKL with initial mastoid presentation has never been reported. The extreme rarity of mastoid AMKL, together with the tendency of extramedullary AMKL to mimic other small blue cell tumors, can create a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of AMKL that initially presented as a mastoid lesion and provide a comprehensive review and analysis that compares the characteristics of extramedullary AMKL and nonmegakaryoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in reported pediatric cases over the past 30 years. We found that patients with extramedullary AMKL were not only younger than patients without megakaryocytic differentiation but were also limited to those </= 2 years of age. In addition, girls predominated in both AMKL and AML MLL(+) groups compared with other types of AML (P = 0.0366 and P = 0.0082). Furthermore, we found that extramedullary AMKL was more likely to involve bone than AML MLL(+) (P < 0.0001) or other types of AML (P = 0.0002). These findings suggest that extramedullary AMKL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of SBCT in children, especially in patients with mastoid or other bony lesions, those </= 2 years of age, and female patients.","['Liang, Conan', 'Chan, Kenny H', 'Yoon, Patricia J', 'Lovell, Mark A']","['Liang C', 'Chan KH', 'Yoon PJ', 'Lovell MA']","[""Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20120605,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,,2012/06/07 06:00,2013/04/18 06:00,['2012/06/07 06:00'],"['2012/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2350/11-12-1124-CR.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2012 Sep-Oct;15(5):385-92. doi: 10.2350/11-12-1124-CR.1.

Herein, we present the management of a liver transplantation recipient who presented with AML and comprehensively review the relevant literature. A 59-year-old male patient presented with fever and cough eight years after an orthotopic liver transplantation for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. He received methylprednisolone and mycofenolate mofetil (MMF) followed by tacrolimus and rapamycin as immunosuppression. Upon admission to our hospital, his peripheral blood demonstrated 34% blasts and pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in transformation to AML. He was treated with induction chemotherapy and his sirolimus was continued but he expired four weeks after from refractory disease. No specific guidelines exist for the treatment of AML in solid organ transplant recipients.

One mechanism of this restriction is deamination of cytidines to uridines in (-) strand DNA, resulting in hypermutation of guanosines to adenosines in viral (+) strands. However, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) is partially resistant to restriction by mouse APOBEC3 (mA3) and virtually completely resistant to mA3-induced hypermutation. In contrast, the sequences of MLV genomes that are in mouse DNA suggest that they were susceptible to mA3-induced deamination when they infected the mouse germline. We tested the possibility that sensitivity to mA3 restriction and to deamination resides in the viral gag gene. We generated a chimeric MLV in which the gag gene was from an endogenous MLV in the mouse germline, while the remainder of the viral genome was from MoMLV. This chimera was fully infectious but its response to mA3 was indistinguishable from that of MoMLV. Thus, the Gag protein does not seem to control the sensitivity of MLVs to mA3. We also found that MLVs inactivated by mA3 do not synthesize viral DNA upon infection; thus mA3 restriction of MLV occurs before or at reverse transcription. In contrast, HIV-1 restricted by mA3 and MLVs restricted by human APOBEC3G do synthesize DNA; these DNAs exhibit APOBEC3-induced hypermutation.","['Sanchez-Martinez, Silvia', 'Aloia, Amanda L', 'Harvin, Demetria', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Jern, Patric', 'Coffin, John M', 'Rein, Alan']","['Sanchez-Martinez S', 'Aloia AL', 'Harvin D', 'Mirro J', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Jern P', 'Coffin JM', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120529,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3362552,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0038190 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-08223 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e38190. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038190.

Although white blood cells (WBCs) with giant nuclei are the main symptom of leukemia, they are not sufficient to prove this disease and other symptoms must be investigated. For example another important symptom of leukemia is the existence of nucleolus in nucleus. The nucleus contains chromatin and a structure called the nucleolus. Chromatin is DNA in its active form while nucleolus is composed of protein and RNA, which are usually inactive. In this paper, to diagnose this symptom and in order to discriminate between nucleoli and chromatins, we employ curvelet transform, which is a multiresolution transform for detecting 2D singularities in images. For this reason, at first nuclei are extracted by means of K-means method, then curvelet transform is applied on extracted nuclei and the coefficients are modified, and finally reconstructed image is used to extract the candidate locations of chromatins and nucleoli. This method is applied on 100 microscopic images and succeeds with specificity of 80.2% and sensitivity of 84.3% to detect the nucleolus candidate zone. After nucleolus candidate zone detection, new features that can be used to classify atypical and blast cells such as gradient of saturation channel are extracted.","['Soltanzadeh, Ramin', 'Rabbani, Hossein', 'Talebi, Ardeshir']","['Soltanzadeh R', 'Rabbani H', 'Talebi A']","['Biomedical Engineering Department, Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120515,United States,Comput Math Methods Med,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,101277751,PMC3361198,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/574184 [doi]'],ppublish,Comput Math Methods Med. 2012;2012:574184. doi: 10.1155/2012/574184.

Uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a feared complication of HSCT. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ T-helper cells believed to maintain tolerance after HSCT. It remains unclear whether low peripheral blood Treg have an impact on the risk for acute (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). METHODS: In this paper we enumerated the CD4+CD25highCD127low Treg in the peripheral blood of 84 patients after at least 150 days from HSCT and in 20 healthy age-matched controls. RESULTS: Although similar mean lymphocyte counts were found in patients and controls, CD3+CD4+ T-cell counts were significantly lower in patients. Patients also had significantly lower Treg percentages among lymphocytes as compared to controls. Patients with cGVHD had even higher percentages of Treg if compared to patients without cGVHD. In multivariate analysis, Treg percentages were not an independent factor for cGVHD. CONCLUSIONS: This paper did not show a relation between deficient peripheral blood Treg and cGVHD, therefore cGVHD does not seem to occur as a result of peripheral Treg paucity.","['Perz, Jolanta B', 'Gurel, Selma', 'Schonland, Stefan O', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Perz JB', 'Gurel S', 'Schonland SO', 'Hegenbart U', 'Ho AD', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. jolanta@tjdengler.info']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,PMC3361289,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/10/27 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/2012/606839 [doi]'],ppublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2012;2012:606839. doi: 10.1100/2012/606839.

MLL1 is a member of the SET1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases, which are required for transcription of genes involved in hematopoiesis and development. MLL1 associates with a subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD), which together form the MLL1 core complex that is required for sequential mono- and dimethylation of H3K4. We previously demonstrated that WDR5 binds the conserved WDR5 interaction (Win) motif of MLL1 in vitro, an interaction that is required for the H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. In this investigation, we demonstrate that arginine 3765 of the MLL1 Win motif is required to co-immunoprecipitate WRAD from mammalian cells, suggesting that the WDR5-Win motif interaction is important for the assembly of the MLL1 core complex in vivo. We also demonstrate that peptides that mimic SET1 family Win motif sequences inhibit H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex with varying degrees of efficiency. To understand the structural basis for these differences, we determined structures of WDR5 bound to six different naturally occurring Win motif sequences at resolutions ranging from 1.9 to 1.2 A. Our results reveal that binding energy differences result from interactions between non-conserved residues C-terminal to the Win motif and to a lesser extent from subtle variation of residues within the Win motif. These results highlight a new class of methylation inhibitors that may be useful for the treatment of MLL1-related malignancies.","['Dharmarajan, Venkatasubramanian', 'Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Patel, Anamika', 'Skalnik, David G', 'Cosgrove, Michael S']","['Dharmarajan V', 'Lee JH', 'Patel A', 'Skalnik DG', 'Cosgrove MS']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120603,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3431640,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47748-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.364125 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 10;287(33):27275-89. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.364125.

And there is no consensus for its treatment in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 7 patients diagnosed with appendicitis among 1209 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with leukemia from 1996 to 2008 at a single institution in Korea. RESULTS: The median age at the time of the diagnosis of appendicitis was 12 years (range: 3-15 years), and 3 of the patients were male. The median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at the time of diagnosis was 0.99x10(9)/L (range: 0-3x10(9)/L). The mean time from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis was 4 days. All 7 leukemia patients with appendicitis underwent surgery and they demonstrated a survival of 100% without significant complications. CONCLUSION: The incidence of appendicitis in pediatric leukemia patients was 0.57% in our study. Early diagnosis with abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography and early surgical resection in leukemic patient with acute appendicitis may be a safer and more effective treatment option. Even when perforation has already occurred and when the patient has an ANC of 0x10(9)/L, surgical treatment may improve overall survival without incurring significant complications.","['Kim, Eun Young', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nak-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki', 'Chung, Jae Hee']","['Kim EY', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK', 'Chung JH']","[""Department of Surgery, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,PMC3381485,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['201207781 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2012.53.4.781 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2012 Jul 1;53(4):781-7. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2012.53.4.781.,20121003,10.3349/ymj.2012.53.4.781 [doi],,,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Appendectomy/adverse effects', 'Appendicitis/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Korea', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissection of the dual function of minor H antigens became evident through their different modes of tissue and cell expression, i.e., hematopoietic system restricted or broad. Broadly expressed minor H antigens are the targets of immune responses in both arms of graft-versus-host (GvH) responses, i.e., both GvHD and GvL, whereas the immune responses against the hematopoietic system-specific minor H antigens are restricted to the GvL arm of SCT. Evidently, it is this latter group of minor H antigens that can function as curative tools for stem-cell (SC)-based immunotherapy of hematological malignancies and disorders. The HLA-matched patient/donor combinations, incompatible for one of the hematopoietic-specific minor H antigens, are suitable for minor H antigen immunotherapy (Goulmy, Immunol Rev 157:125-140, 1997). Information on the minor H antigen phenotype is therefore needed. Hereto, genomic typing for minor H antigens has been implemented in many HLA laboratories. Here, we firstly summarize the relevance of minor H antigens particularly in hematopoietic SCT. Secondly, we describe a method for typing the various polymorphic minor H antigens molecularly identified to date by DNA sequencing.","['Spierings, Eric', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Spierings E', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-842-9_29 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2012;882:509-30. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-842-9_29.,20121015,10.1007/978-1-61779-842-9_29 [doi],,,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New discoveries in NK cell biology, including characterization of NK cell receptors and their interactions with self-HLA molecules and a better understanding of the mechanism of NK cell education have led to the development of novel strategies to exploit NK cell alloreactivity against tumors. While early studies using autologous NK cells lacked efficacy, the use of adoptively transferred NK cells to treat hematopoietic malignancies has been expanding. The production of allogeneic donor NK cells requires efficient removal of T- and B cells from clinical-scale leukapheresis collections.

METHODS: Within 72 h of admission to our department, an ESBLE and VRE screening stool sample was collected. In the case of neutropenic fever, blood cultures were drawn. Data of all admitted patients were prospectively documented. Explorative forward-stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for progression from intestinal colonisation to BSI. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,805 stool samples were obtained from 513 patients during 1,012 inpatient stays, and 2,766 blood cultures were obtained from 578 patients during 1,091 inpatient stays. Ninety (17.5 %) of these patients were colonised with ESBLE and 51 (9.9 %) with VRE. Proportions of 40 % (36/90) of ESBLE and 61 % (31/51) of VRE colonisations were healthcare-associated. Six of 90 (6.6 %) ESBLE-colonised patients and 1/51 (2 %) VRE-colonised patients developed BSI with the respective organism. None of these patients died after receiving early appropriate empiric antibiotics based on colonisation status. Colonisation with ESBLE or VRE was associated with increased risk ratios (RR) towards developing ESBLE BSI [RR 4.5, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.89-7.04] and VRE BSI (RR 10.2, 95 % CI: 7.87-13.32), respectively.

Here, we report bioluminescent acute leukemia xenograft mouse models of the most frequent and aggressive MLL-related acute leukemias (infant and adult MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF4). Four acute leukemia cell lines carrying MLL-related translocations were stably transduced with a firefly luciferase transgene and injected intravenously into NOD/SCID mice. Leukemia progression was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). All mice developed MLL-related acute leukemia. The four MLL-related acute leukemia models showed a different course of infant and adult MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia, and a rapid aggressiveness of MLL-ENL acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MLL-AF4 acute biphenotypic leukemia. Tissue analysis and RT-PCR of bone marrow, spleen and liver from the mice confirmed the BL results. To validate BLI for the detection of a therapeutic response, systemic treatment with an anti-luciferase-targeting siRNA (siLuc) complexed with cationic nanoparticles was administered to mice with MLL-AF4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The BLI signal showed a reduction following treatment with siLuc compared to the control mice. These mouse models present MLL-related acute leukemia evolution similar to the human counterparts. Moreover, they are non-invasive, rapid and sensitive models, suitable for the in vivo study of MLL-related acute leukemias. Finally, BLI showed in vivo luminescence down modulation obtained by systemic treatment with luciferase-targeting siRNA nanoparticle complexes, confirming that these MLL-related leukemia mouse models are optimal for the evaluation and selection of delivery systems for siRNA and other new biotechnological pharmaceuticals.","['Fazzina, Raffaella', 'Lombardini, Lorenza', 'Mezzanotte, Laura', 'Roda, Aldo', 'Hrelia, Patrizia', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Tonelli, Roberto']","['Fazzina R', 'Lombardini L', 'Mezzanotte L', 'Roda A', 'Hrelia P', 'Pession A', 'Tonelli R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Sant' Orsola Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120531,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1504 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Aug;41(2):621-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1504.

Ph(+) leukemia cells frequently express death-inducing receptors (DR4 and DR5) for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is one of the cytotoxic ligands expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells mediating the GVL effect. Here we demonstrate that imatinib specifically downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in cell lines and clinical samples of Ph(+) leukemia. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) and short hairpin RNA against bcr-abl also downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in Ph(+) leukemia cells, and transfection of bcr-abl into a Ph(-) leukemia cell line induced DR4 and DR5 expression, which was abrogated by imatinib treatment. Accordingly, Ph(+) leukemia cells that had been pretreated with imatinib showed resistance to the pro-apoptotic activity of recombinant human soluble TRAIL. These observations demonstrate that BCR-ABL is critically involved in the leukemia-specific expression of DR4 and DR5 and in the susceptibility of Ph(+) leukemia to TRAIL-mediated anti-leukemic activity, providing new insight into the mechanisms of the tumor-specific cytotoxic activities of TRAIL.","['Kuroda, I', 'Inukai, T', 'Zhang, X', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Nemoto, A', 'Akahane, K', 'Hirose, K', 'Honna-Oshiro, H', 'Goi, K', 'Kagami, K', 'Yagita, H', 'Tauchi, T', 'Maeda, Y', 'Sugita, K']","['Kuroda I', 'Inukai T', 'Zhang X', 'Kikuchi J', 'Furukawa Y', 'Nemoto A', 'Akahane K', 'Hirose K', 'Honna-Oshiro H', 'Goi K', 'Kagami K', 'Yagita H', 'Tauchi T', 'Maeda Y', 'Sugita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/06/06 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012186 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.186 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Mar 28;32(13):1670-81. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.186.

In this study we used antisense oligonucleotide (AS) to manipulate VEGF function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HL60 and primary AML cells were transfected with VEGF AS (0.3 micromol/l). Cell proliferation and survival were assessed using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The viability of cells was determined using MTT. The IC50 values of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in HL60 cell were calculated by ICp software. The results showed that VEGF AS effectively inhibited AML cell proliferation and survival 72 hours post-transfection and exhibited time dependence. The IC50 value of ATO was significantly down-regulated by VEGF AS in HL60. Meanwhile, VEGF AS alone induced cell apoptosis, and promoted ATO-induced apoptosis. There is synergistic inhibitory effects between AS and ATO. VEGF AS down-regulated VEGF protein level in the supernatants and cellular VEGF mRNA level by western blot and real-time PCR. Therefore, targeted inhibition of VEGF suppressed survival and increased arsenic sensitivity in AML.","['Ding, Yong', 'Zhu, Xuejiao', 'Li, Yumin', 'Fei, Jia', 'Zhang, Yuan']","['Ding Y', 'Zhu X', 'Li Y', 'Fei J', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/06/06 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13376952196458 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 May;17(3):157-62. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13376952196458.,20130103,10.1179/102453312X13376952196458 [doi],,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Transfection', 'Trypan Blue', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the role of cardiac biomarkers; cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), as early predictors of chronic cardiotoxicity in survivors of acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried a retrospective study on 50 asymptomatic survivors of acute leukemia who received anthracycline in their treatment protocols. All patients underwent blood sampling to determine the levels of NT-pro-BNP and cTnT along with conventional echocardiography and TDI. RESULTS: None had abnormal cTnT levels. About 20% had abnormal NT-pro-BNP levels. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle was the most significant in conventional echocardiography. TDI was superior as it detected myocardial affection in 10% more than echo. TDI demonstrated global myocardial damage with significant aberrations in peak myocardial velocities and ratios. CONCLUSIONS: NT-pro-BNP can be used as a sensitive cardiac biomarker in monitoring of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Follow up is essential to validate the role of NT-pro-BNP as an early marker for late onset anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Tissue Doppler is marvelous as it could detect early cardiac dysfunction even in those with normal study by conventional echocardiography.","['Sherief, Laila M', 'Kamal, Ahmad G', 'Khalek, E A', 'Kamal, Naglaa M', 'Soliman, Attia A A', 'Esh, Asmaa M']","['Sherief LM', 'Kamal AG', 'Khalek EA', 'Kamal NM', 'Soliman AA', 'Esh AM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/06/06 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13376952196412 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 May;17(3):151-6. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13376952196412.,20130103,10.1179/102453312X13376952196412 [doi],,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cardiotoxins/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Troponin T/blood', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/blood/chemically induced/*diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the involvement of stem cells is considered to be important in hematological malignancies as well as normal hematopoiesis, we examined the expression of newly defined HSC factors including HOXB4, TCFEC, HMGB-1, FOS, and SPI-1 in the bone marrow (BM) from de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Expression levels of mRNA extracted from frozen specimens of AML patients and normal controls were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the HSC factors, HOXB4 exhibited significantly higher expression in the BM of AML as compared with normal controls. Immunostaining for HOXB4 revealed that the HOXB4-positive cell ratios correlated well with the expression levels of mRNA for HOXB4 in AML BM. Based on the HOXB4-positive cell ratio, AML patients were divided into two groups (cases with higher ratios and lower ratios). The group with higher HOXB4-positive cell ratios had better prognoses as compared with the group with lower ratios. Multivariate analysis confirmed the HOXB4-positivity as an independent predictor of overall survival of AML patients. Lastly, mRNA expression levels for HOXB4 were inversely correlated with the expression levels of at least two genes, including ABCB1, which is known to be a multidrug-resistance gene. Our study distinguishes a subgroup of AML with higher HOXB4 expression and better prognosis, and this might be reflected by relative drug sensitivity in leukemic cells.","['Umeda, Shigeaki', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Murayama, Toshihiko', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Ohshima, Takumi', 'Suzuki, Shiho', 'Sugawara, Emiko', 'Kawano, Fumio', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Umeda S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Murayama T', 'Hidaka M', 'Kurata M', 'Ohshima T', 'Suzuki S', 'Sugawara E', 'Kawano F', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. umeda.pth2@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/06/06 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13376952196250 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 May;17(3):125-31. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13376952196250.,20130103,10.1179/102453312X13376952196250 [doi],,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with 0.1 mM MP and K-562 cells were treated with 0.4 mM MP according to their IC(50) values. STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B mRNA relative expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR whereas the protein levels were detected via western-blot analysis and apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V method. RESULTS: A significant decrease was seen in STAT5A mRNA relative expression level at 48 hours of MP treatment (P < 0.05) both in HL-60 and K-562 cells. Other STATs showed a lower downregulation in their relative expressions at 48 hours at mRNA level for both of the cell lines. STAT proteins showed no expression change in K-562 cells in time course experiments but while STAT5A expression was downregulated; STAT5B showed an increase at 96 hours in HL-60 cells. Apoptosis was triggered by high-dose MP treatment that was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. CONCLUSION: The JAK/STAT pathway components may play an important role in the apoptosis mechanism of leukemic cells under MP treatment in HL-60 and K-562 cells. Other pathways may also be involved with a post-translational modification seen in the HL-60 cell line, with both upregulation and downregulation of protein expression levels of STAT5B and STAT5A, respectively.","['Kaymaz, Burcin Tezcanli', 'Selvi, Nur', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Kosova, Buket']","['Kaymaz BT', 'Selvi N', 'Saydam G', 'Sahin F', 'Kosova B']","['Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey. burcin.tezcanli@ege.edu.tr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13221316477859 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Mar;17(2):93-9. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13221316477859.,20121214,10.1179/102453312X13221316477859 [doi],,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are all to a degree immunodeficient. In order to elucidate the feature of T-cell receptor signal transduction in CLL, the expression levels of CD3gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chain, FcepsilonRIgamma, and Zap-70 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green technique was used for detecting the gene expression level in PBMCs from 13 patients with CLL, 13 healthy individuals, and 10 B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) served as control. The beta2-microglobulin gene was used as an endogenous reference. Relative mRNA expression level of genes was analyzed by using the 2(-DeltaCt) x 100% method. Significant lower expression levels of CD3gamma, epsilon, and zeta chain genes, as well as FcepsilonRIgamma gene were found in CLL samples. Moreover, there was lost the negative correlation of the expression levels between CD3zeta and FcepsilonRIgamma genes. The expression level of Zap-70 in CLL was lower than those from healthy controls, while higher than those from B-ALL group. There was no significant correlation between the expression levels of CD3zeta and Zap-70 genes neither in the healthy group nor in the CLL group. In conclusion, the results provide a global gene expression profile of CD3gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains, and the CD3zeta-related genes FcepsilonRIgamma and Zap-70 in CLL. Deficiency of these gene expression levels might represent the feature related to T-cell immunodeficiency. The study might contribute to better understand the cellular immune features in CLL patients.","['Huang, Le', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Li, Bo', 'Yu, Zhi', 'Wang, Liang', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Huang L', 'Chen S', 'Zha X', 'Yang L', 'Li B', 'Yu Z', 'Wang L', 'Li Y']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences Faculty, Monash University Clayton Campus, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13221316477895 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Mar;17(2):71-5. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13221316477895.,20121214,10.1179/102453312X13221316477895 [doi],,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (FcepsilonRI gamma-chain, human)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/*genetics/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Protein Subunits/*genetics/immunology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a median age at diagnosis of 72 years, newer treatment options with less toxicity than standard nucleoside analogue-based regimens are needed. Historically, few therapy options are available once CLL has become refractory to nucleoside analogues. Bendamustine has emerged as a feasible therapy for older and less fit CLL patients, with clinical efficacy in previously untreated and refractory CLL. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews several of the pivotal clinical trials that established the clinical activity of bendamustine in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. The toxicity profile of bendamustine, primarily myelosuppression and infections, is reviewed and compared across different CLL populations. A review of the clinical data focuses on potential explanations for differences in response rates and duration of remission reported across studies and how this may impact the development of therapies for CLL. EXPERT OPINION: Bendamustine is a valuable new agent for the management of CLL. Ongoing clinical trials are comparing bendamustine with standard CLL regimens in untreated disease, and investigating bendamustine combinations with novel targeted therapies and monoclonal antibodies. These studies will help to define the optimal role for bendamustine in CLL management.","['Chang, Julie Elizabeth', 'Kahl, Brad Steven']","['Chang JE', 'Kahl BS']","['University of Wisconsin - Medicine, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705-2275, USA. jc2@medicine.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20120605,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,PMC3467097,2012/06/06 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2012.693163 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2012 Jul;13(10):1495-505. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2012.693163.

Neurocognitive deficits have been described following ITC, but language status post-treatment is yet to be clarified. This study examined the language skills of nine children following ITC for ALL (mean age 7;8 years and 3;2 years post-diagnosis at baseline measurement) and nine age- and sex-matched controls, at baseline then 2 years later, using a battery of tests assessing general language skills. An assessment of cognitively-demanding high level language skills was undertaken on a sub-group of the children (n =12). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between children treated with ITC and controls when comparing change in performance scores from baseline measurement to 2 years post-baseline measurement. Descriptive analysis of three of the ALL participants in the Intermediate Stage survivorship at language re-assessment indicated no clinically-significant change in performance over 2 years for all measures except receptive language skills, which improved over the time for two of the children. As language skills continue to develop into late adolescence, the need for the monitoring of language abilities of children treated at a young age with ITC as they enter the Intermediate and Late Stages of survivorship is discussed.","['Lewis, Fiona M', 'Perry, Meghan L', 'Murdoch, Bruce E']","['Lewis FM', 'Perry ML', 'Murdoch BE']","['Centre for Neurogenic Communication Disorders Research, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane 4072, Australia. f.lewis@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,England,Int J Speech Lang Pathol,International journal of speech-language pathology,101320232,,2012/06/06 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2012/06/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/17549507.2012.684888 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Speech Lang Pathol. 2013 Apr;15(2):156-64. doi: 10.3109/17549507.2012.684888.

Approximately one-third of these children can be cured. Their risk for late effects is high because of intensified treatment, but their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was largely unmeasured. Our aim was to compare HRQOL of ALL survivors with the general population, and of relapsed with non-relapsed ALL survivors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS) we sent a questionnaire to all ALL survivors in Switzerland who had been diagnosed between 1976-2003 at age <16 years, survived >/=5 years, and were currently aged >/=16 years. HRQOL was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), which measures four aspects of physical health and four aspects of mental health. A score of 50 corresponded to the mean of a healthy reference population. We analyzed data from 457 ALL survivors (response: 79%). Sixty-one survivors had suffered a relapse. Compared to the general population, ALL survivors reported similar or higher HRQOL scores on all scales. Survivors with a relapse scored lower in general health perceptions (51.6) compared to those without (55.8;p=0.005), but after adjusting for self-reported late effects, this difference disappeared. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to population norms, ALL survivors reported good HRQOL, even after a relapse. However, relapsed ALL survivors reported poorer general health than non-relapsed. Therefore, we encourage specialists to screen for poor general health in survivors after a relapse and, when appropriate, specifically seek and treat underlying late effects. This will help to improve patients' HRQOL.","['Essig, Stefan', 'von der Weid, Nicolas X', 'Strippoli, Marie-Pierre F', 'Rebholz, Cornelia E', 'Michel, Gisela', 'Rueegg, Corina S', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Essig S', 'von der Weid NX', 'Strippoli MP', 'Rebholz CE', 'Michel G', 'Rueegg CS', 'Niggli FK', 'Kuehni CE']","['Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['133897/Swiss National Science Foundation/Switzerland'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3360640,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0038015 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-06631 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e38015. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038015.

To investigate the roles of p21 in transcriptional control, we studied the gene expression changes in two human cell systems. Using a human leukemia cell line (K562) with inducible p21 expression and human primary keratinocytes with adenoviral-mediated p21 expression, we carried out microarray-based gene expression profiling. We found that p21 rapidly and strongly repressed the mRNA levels of a number of genes involved in cell cycle and mitosis. One of the most strongly down-regulated genes was CCNE2 (cyclin E2 gene). Mutational analysis in K562 cells showed that the N-terminal region of p21 is required for repression of gene expression of CCNE2 and other genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that p21 was bound to human CCNE2 and other p21-repressed genes gene in the vicinity of the transcription start site. Moreover, p21 repressed human CCNE2 promoter-luciferase constructs in K562 cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the CDE motif is present in most of the promoters of the p21-regulated genes. Altogether, the results suggest that p21 exerts a repressive effect on a relevant number of genes controlling S phase and mitosis. Thus, p21 activity as inhibitor of cell cycle progression would be mediated not only by the inhibition of CDKs but also by the transcriptional down-regulation of key genes.","['Ferrandiz, Nuria', 'Caraballo, Juan M', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Lucia', 'Devgan, Vikram', 'Rodriguez-Paredes, Manuel', 'Lafita, M Carmen', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Quintanilla, Andrea', 'Munoz-Alonso, M Jose', 'Blanco, Rosa', 'Reyes, Jose C', 'Agell, Neus', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Dotto, G Paolo', 'Leon, Javier']","['Ferrandiz N', 'Caraballo JM', 'Garcia-Gutierrez L', 'Devgan V', 'Rodriguez-Paredes M', 'Lafita MC', 'Bretones G', 'Quintanilla A', 'Munoz-Alonso MJ', 'Blanco R', 'Reyes JC', 'Agell N', 'Delgado MD', 'Dotto GP', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (IBBTEC), Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC-SODERCAN, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120525,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3360621,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0037759 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-22619 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37759. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037759.

DREAM6 provided flow cytometry data for 359 normal and AML samples, and the class labels for half of the samples. Researchers were asked to predict the class labels of the remaining half.

We focused on the in vitro effects of MJ-29 on ER stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic death in WEHI-3 cells, and to hypothesize that MJ-29 might fully impair the orthotopic leukemic mice. Our results indicated that a concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability was shown in MJ-29-treated cells. DNA content was examined utilizing flow cytometry, whereas apoptotic populations were determined using annexin V/PI, DAPI staining and TUNEL assay. Increasing vital factors of mitochondrial dysfunction by MJ-29 were further investigated. Thus, MJ-29-provaked apoptosis of WEHI-3 cells is mediated through the intrinsic pathway. Importantly, intracellular Ca(2+) release and ER stress-associated signaling also contributed to MJ-29-triggered cell apoptosis. We found that MJ-29 stimulated the protein levels of calpain 1, CHOP and p-eIF2alpha pathways in WEHI-3 cells. In in vivo experiments, intraperitoneal administration of MJ-29 significantly improved the total survival rate, enhanced body weight and attenuated enlarged spleen and liver tissues in leukemic mice. The infiltration of immature myeloblastic cells into splenic red pulp was reduced in MJ-29-treated leukemic mice. Moreover, MJ-29 increased the differentiations of T and B cells but decreased that of macrophages and monocytes. Additionally, MJ-29-stimulated immune responses might be involved in anti-leukemic activity in vivo. Based on these observations, MJ-29 suppresses WEHI-3 cells in vitro and in vivo, and it is proposed that this potent and selective agent could be a new chemotherapeutic candidate for anti-leukemia in the future.","['Lu, Chi-Cheng', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Chiang, Jo-Hua', 'Hour, Mann-Jen', 'Lin, Kuei-Li', 'Lin, Jen-Jyh', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Tsuzuki, Minoru', 'Lee, Tsung-Han', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Lu CC', 'Yang JS', 'Chiang JH', 'Hour MJ', 'Lin KL', 'Lin JJ', 'Huang WW', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Lee TH', 'Chung JG']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3360742,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036831 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-24871 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36831. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036831.

D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) is a pegylated vitamin E derivate. In this study, a novel liposomal-emodin-conjugating TPGS was formulated and compared with methoxypolyethyleneglycol 2000-derivatized distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (mPEG2000-DSPE) liposomal emodin. TPGS improved the encapsulation efficiency and stability of emodin egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes. A high encapsulation efficiency of 95.2% +/- 3.0%, particle size of 121.1 +/- 44.9 nm, spherical ultrastructure, and sustained in vitro release of TPGS liposomal emodin were observed; these were similar to mPEG2000-DSPE liposomes. Only the zeta potential of -13.1 +/- 2.7 mV was significantly different to that for mPEG2000-DSPE liposomes. Compared to mPEG2000-DSPE liposomes, TPGS liposomes improved the cytotoxicity of emodin on leukemia cells by regulating the protein levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein, which was further enhanced by transferrin. TPGS liposomes prolonged the circulation time of emodin in the blood, with the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 1.7 times larger than for free emodin and 0.91 times larger than for mPEG2000-DSPE liposomes. In addition, TPGS liposomes showed higher AUC for emodin in the lung and kidney than for mPEG2000-DSPE liposomes, and both liposomes elevated the amount of emodin in the heart. Overall, TPGS is a pegylated agent that could potentially be used to compose a stable liposomal emodin with enhanced therapeutics.","['Wang, Tiechuang', 'Yin, Xiaodong', 'Lu, Yaping', 'Shan, Weiguang', 'Xiong, Subin']","['Wang T', 'Yin X', 'Lu Y', 'Shan W', 'Xiong S']","[""College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120508,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC3357979,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S31029 [doi]', 'ijn-7-2325 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:2325-37. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S31029.

SM and AHNMD even may be clonally related. This report contributes to a better understanding of the different morphological aspects of SM by demonstrating that various AHNMDs can be detected in one patient during the course of disease. Routinely processed biopsy specimens of bone marrow and spleen removed from a 63-year-old man were investigated including a broad panel of immunohistochemical stainings. KIT codon 816 mutation analysis was carried out by melting point analysis of nested PCR products amplified from DNA of pooled microdissected mast cells. The histomorphological features of the initial bone marrow showed diffuse infiltration by hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Occult SM was only detected retrospectively by demonstration of a slight diffuse increase in loosely scattered, spindle-shaped mast cells carrying the activating point mutation KIT ( D816V ). In the second bone marrow, core biopsy removed about two years later HCL had been completely eradicated, while a diagnosis of SM-AHNMD with multifocal compact mast cell infiltrates associated with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and significant increase in eosinophilic granulocytes was established. The third and last bone marrow biopsy specimen lacked the features of both MPN and HCL but showed progression into a secondary mast cell leukemia (MCL) with a focal sarcomatous component.

In this study we demonstrate that the human KG-1 cell line, a model of acute myelogenous leukaemia, expresses functional P2X7. RT-PCR and immunochemical techniques demonstrated the presence of P2X7 mRNA and protein respectively in KG-l cells, as well as in positive control multiple myeloma RPMI 8226 cells. Flow cytometric measurements demonstrated that ATP induced ethidium(+) uptake into KG-l cells suspended in sucrose medium (EC(50) of approximately 3 muM), but not into cells in NaCl medium. In contrast, ATP induced ethidium(+) uptake into RPMI 8226 cells suspended in either sucrose or NaCl medium (EC(50) of approximately 3 or approximately 99 muM, respectively), as well as into RPMI 8226 cells in KCl medium (EC(50) of approximately 18 muM). BzATP and to a lesser extent ATPgammaS and alphabeta-methylene ATP, but not ADP or UTP, also induced ethidium(+) uptake into KG-1 cells. ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake was completely impaired by the P2X7 antagonists, AZ10606120 and A-438079. ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake was also impaired by probenecid but not by carbenoxolone, both pannexin-1 antagonists. ATP induced YO-PRO-1(2+) and propidium(2+) uptake into KG-1 cells. Finally, sequencing of full-length P2X7 cDNA identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KG-1 cells including H155Y, A348T, T357S and Q460R. RPMI 8226 cells contained A348T, A433V and H521Q SNPs. In conclusion, the KG-1 cell line expresses functional P2X7.

Ninety-three selected apoptotic genes were analyzed using 384 TaqMan(R) Low Density Arrays in pooled RNA. RESULTS: Relevant results were found in a set of 27 genes, however, the most striking differences between FA and 2-CdA were observed in the following 5 genes: BAD, TNFRSF21, DAPK1, CARD 6 and CARD 9. CONCLUSION: We have found some differences in apoptotic gene expression between FAand 2-CdA.

Only allogeneic stem cell transplantation enables disease eradication. In addition to the Bcr-Abl1 oncoprotein, TKIs also inhibit off-target kinases (e.g. c-kit, Src, Tec), some of them having physiological functions in immune responses.

We cloned a novel RUNX1 chimeric gene generated by t(7;21)(q11.2;q22) in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis showed a tail-to-tail fusion between RUNX1 on 21q22 and DTX2 on 7q11.2, with an insertion of short complementary sequence from UPK3B adjacent to DTX2. DTX2 encodes a putative E3-ubiquitin ligase with no known biological function. There are two possible functions of RUNX1-reversed UPK3B-DTX2: one from aberrant RUNX1 chimeric protein and the other from the reversed sequence of DTX2. The predicted aberrant protein expressed under the RUNX1 promoter was highly structurally similar to RUNX1a. In a reporter assay, the aberrant protein inhibited the trans-activation function of RUNX1 in a dominant-negative manner, similar to RUNX1a. In contrast, the DTX2 reversed sequence may degrade wild-type DTX2 transcript or suppress its translation. In conclusion, we identified a novel fusion RUNX1 partner, DTX2, which chimerize in a reverse direction. This is the first example of RUNX1 chimera in an opposing direction generated by chromosomal translocation in leukemia. In addition to the aberrantly truncated RUNX1 protein, the DTX2 antisense sequence may play some role in the development of leukemia carrying the t(7;21) translocation.","['Maki, Kazuhiro', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Sugita, Fusako', 'Nakamura, Yuka', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Maki K', 'Sasaki K', 'Sugita F', 'Nakamura Y', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, 880 Kitakobayashi, Mibu-machi, Shimotsuga-gun, Tochigi, 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120604,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2012/06/05 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1112-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Aug;96(2):268-73. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1112-z.

The single-institution treatment experiences of Chinese patients with CML were presented. A total of 275 CML patients (CP, 210; AP, 24; and BP, 41) who received imatinib between February 2001 and April 2008 were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the treatment responses (hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and prognostic factors of outcome. At the cut-off point, the complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and complete molecular response rates of patients in the CP were 84.7% and 61.9%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of patients in the AP (50% and 29.1%, respectively, both P < 0.001) and BP (24.3% and 9.7%, respectively, both P < 0.001). The estimated five-year OS and five-year EFS rates were 93.2% and 86.4% for CP patients, as well as 64.5% and 50.9% for AP patients, which were significantly higher than those for BP patients (P < 0.001). In CP patients, univariate analysis revealed that early treatment with imatinib, achieving CCyR within 12 months, additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and kinase domain mutations were associated with the treatment outcome. More patients are needed to carry out multivariate analysis.","['He, Haiyan', 'Shen, Yang', 'Zhu, Yongmei', 'Chen, Saijuan']","['He H', 'Shen Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Chen S']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20120603,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/10/06 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-012-0202-x [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2012 Jun;6(2):204-11. doi: 10.1007/s11684-012-0202-x.

Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs), a family of seven secreted glycoproteins, are known to support the activity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro and in vivo. ANGPTLs also have important roles in lipid metabolism, angiogenesis and inflammation, but were considered 'orphan ligands' because no receptors were identified. Here we show that the immune-inhibitory receptor human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) and its mouse orthologue paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PIRB) are receptors for several ANGPTLs. LILRB2 and PIRB are expressed on human and mouse HSCs, respectively, and the binding of ANGPTLs to these receptors supported ex vivo expansion of HSCs. In mouse transplantation acute myeloid leukaemia models, a deficiency in intracellular signalling of PIRB resulted in increased differentiation of leukaemia cells, revealing that PIRB supports leukaemia development. Our study indicates an unexpected functional significance of classical immune-inhibitory receptors in maintenance of stemness of normal adult stem cells and in support of cancer development.","['Zheng, Junke', 'Umikawa, Masato', 'Cui, Changhao', 'Li, Jiyuan', 'Chen, Xiaoli', 'Zhang, Chaozheng', 'Huynh, HoangDinh', 'Kang, Xunlei', 'Silvany, Robert', 'Wan, Xuan', 'Ye, Jingxiao', 'Canto, Alberto Puig', 'Chen, Shu-Hsia', 'Wang, Huan-You', 'Ward, E Sally', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng']","['Zheng J', 'Umikawa M', 'Cui C', 'Li J', 'Chen X', 'Zhang C', 'Huynh H', 'Kang X', 'Silvany R', 'Wan X', 'Ye J', 'Canto AP', 'Chen SH', 'Wang HY', 'Ward ES', 'Zhang CC']","['Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['K01 CA120099-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA120099-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA 120099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA120099-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA120099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA120099-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120530,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,PMC3367397,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11095 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11095 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 May 30;485(7400):656-60. doi: 10.1038/nature11095.,20120712,10.1038/nature11095 [doi],,,"['0 (LILRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pirb protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism']",['NIHMS367467'],,,,,,['GEO/GSE36329'],,,,"['Nature. 2012 Aug 30;488(7413):684.

However, the definition of suboptimal response remains under discussion. METHODS: We used conventional cytogenetics for the detection of clonal changes in Ph-positive and negative clones. RT-PCR and sequencing were carried out on peripheral blood leukocytes to detect the type of BCR-ABL1 transcript. The BCR-ABL1 mutational status was assessed using sequencing of RT-PCR products. High performance capillary electrophoresis for determination of imatinib (IMA) plasma concentration was used. RESULTS: A retrospective study of 110 patients diagnosed with chronic-phase (CP) CML treated with IMA or 2(nd) generation TKIs in the years 2000-2009 focused on analysis of patients with suboptimal response according to ELN criteria. 40 patients were administered IMA as first-line therapy and 70 had been pretreated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) with or without Ara-C and/or hydroxyurea (HU) for a median 12 months (range, 1-92 months). After adjusting for the ELN criteria, major molecular response (MMR) was achieved after median 34 and 39 months in 66.7% and 41.7% of patients after the first and second-line IMA therapy with suboptimal response defined as lack of achievement of MMR at the 18(th) month of treatment, respectively. In comparison to patients with optimal response, patients with suboptimal response did not show significant differences in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). Cytogenetic assays demonstrated additional chromosome abnormalities (ACAs): chromosome 8 trisomy in a Ph-negative clone during the IMA treatment (in 1 case) and der(9q) in Ph-positive clone (in 2 cases); in patients receiving first-line IMA only chromosome 8 trisomy was observed which was associated with myelodysplastic syndrome - this was the only case where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed. During the treatment with IMA in both subgroups no regulatory mutations in the ABL kinase domain were confirmed. CONCLUSION: We believe that the category of suboptimal response should be redefined or withdrawn from the ELN 2009 recommendations for management of CML patients treated with TKIs. Patients with suboptimal response who have no additional risks (additional cytogenetic abnormalities or BCR-ABL1 regulatory mutations) may remain on IMA treatment while patients with these risks should be switched to the 2(nd) generation TKIs.","['Rohon, Peter', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Rozmanova, Sarka', 'Friedecky, David', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Rohon P', 'Faber E', 'Divoka M', 'Rozmanova S', 'Friedecky D', 'Jarosova M', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc and Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic. peter.rohon@centrum.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111130,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,2012/06/05 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2011.059 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2013 Jun;157(2):181-8. doi: 10.5507/bp.2011.059.

Tumor cell killing also occurred when autologous NK cells were used as effector cells. Compared with rituximab, the tribody demonstrated depletion of autologous B cells in ex vivo whole blood assays at 100-fold lower antibody concentration.

The optimal clinical strategy to manage hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD is unclear. To examine whether anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy can influence chemosensitivity of ALL cells, we examined the impacts of different anti-diabetic agents on ALL cell lines and patient samples. Pharmacologically achievable concentrations of insulin, aspart and glargine significantly increased the number of ALL cells, and aspart and glargine did so at lower concentrations than human insulin. In contrast, metformin and rosiglitazone significantly decreased the cell number. Human insulin and analogs activated AKT/mTOR signaling and stimulated ALL cell proliferation (as measured by flow cytometric methods), but metformin and rosiglitazone blocked AKT/mTOR signaling and inhibited proliferation. Metformin 500 muM and rosiglitazone 10 muM were found to sensitize Reh cells to daunorubicin, while aspart, glargine and human insulin (all at 1.25 mIU/L) enhanced chemoresistance. Metformin and rosiglitazone enhanced daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, while insulin, aspart and glargine antagonized daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. In addition, metformin increased etoposide-induced and L-asparaginase-induced apoptosis; rosiglitazone increased etoposide-induced and vincristine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that use of insulins to control hyperglycemia in ALL patients may contribute to anthracycline chemoresistance, while metformin and thiazolidinediones may improve chemosensitivity to anthracycline as well as other chemotherapy drugs through their different impacts on AKT/mTOR signaling in leukemic cells. Our data suggest that the choice of anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy during chemotherapy may influence clinical outcomes in ALL.","['Pan, Jingxuan', 'Chen, Chun', 'Jin, Yanli', 'Fuentes-Mattei, Enrique', 'Velazquez-Tores, Guermarie', 'Benito, Juliana Maria', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Lee, Mong-Hong', 'Yeung, Sai-Ching Jim']","['Pan J', 'Chen C', 'Jin Y', 'Fuentes-Mattei E', 'Velazquez-Tores G', 'Benito JM', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Lee MH', 'Yeung SC']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA089266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120615,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC3383592,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/10/18 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['20770 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.20770 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Jun 15;11(12):2314-26. doi: 10.4161/cc.20770.

We wished to determine which ATG specificities are important for GVHD prevention. We measured day 7 serum levels of 23 ATG specificities in 120 hematopoietic cell transplant recipients whose myeloablative conditioning included 4.5 mg/kg ATG (thymoglobulin). High levels of ATG specificities capable of binding to T- and B-cell subsets were associated with a low likelihood of acute GVHD (aGVHD). High levels of these ATG specificities were associated with increased rates of viral but not bacterial or fungal infections. They were not associated with an increased risk of malignancy relapse; on the contrary, high levels of ATG specificities capable of binding to regulatory T cells and invariant NKT cells were associated with a low risk of relapse. In conclusion, high levels of ATG antibodies to Ag(s) expressed on T and B cells are associated with a low risk of aGVHD and a high risk of viral but not bacterial or fungal infections.

Patients with FLT3/ITD + AML had significantly inferior DFS (2-year DFS: 19% vs 64%, P = 0.0027), increased risk of relapse (1-year: 59% vs 19%, P = 0.01), and a trend towards decreased OS (P = 0.08) compared with patients without FLT3/ITD. Multivariate analysis confirmed FLT3/ITD + independently predicted a shorter DFS (HR, 3.0; 95% CI), 1.4-6.5; P = 0.01) and increased risk of relapse (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.0-12.3, P = 0.01).

The Fusarium species most frequently involved in human infections are Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium verticillioides. However, identification is a cumbersome and time-consuming task. Fusarium is resistant in vitro to many of the antifungal agents and the management of fusariosis is not well defined. OBJECTIVES: To emphasise the difficulty of identifying Fusarium spp. by conventional methods and the need of new rapid molecular tests to achieve earlier diagnosis and appropriate therapy. METHODS: A disseminated Fusarium infection due to F. verticillioides was documented in a neutropenic refractory patient with acute myeloid leukaemia, relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: The patient died despite liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole combination and ""in vitro"" susceptibility of agents employed. Morphological and molecular identification of F. verticillioides was obtained only after the death of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the poor outcome of an invasive fungal disease caused by Fusarium in aplastic patients. Identification of members of Fusarium genus remains restricted to selected laboratories and should be introduced into routine mycological diagnostics. In immunocompromised patients, diagnosis of fusariosis is directly related to prompt diagnosis and to patient's status. Current diagnosis methods and therapeutic options are discussed.","['Fanci, Rosa', 'Pini, Gabriella', 'Bartolesi, Anna Maria', 'Pecile, Patrizia']","['Fanci R', 'Pini G', 'Bartolesi AM', 'Pecile P']","['Haematology Unit, Careggi Hospital and University of Florence, Florence, Italy. rosa.fanci@unifi.it']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120529,Spain,Rev Iberoam Micol,Revista iberoamericana de micologia,9425531,,2012/06/05 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1130-1406(12)00060-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.riam.2012.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Iberoam Micol. 2013 Jan 3;30(1):51-3. doi: 10.1016/j.riam.2012.05.003.

By using a phosphoproteomic approach, we aimed to discover aberrant signaling pathways and putative biomarkers in bone marrow samples of suboptimally responding patients, which could be used to guide treatment selection at the diagnosis. The study consisted of 20 chronic-phase CML patients (10 optimal and 10 suboptimal response patients based on 18 months European-Leukemia-Net criteria) and healthy bone marrow cells, and CML cell lines were used as controls. The phosphorylation profile of normal bone marrow cells diverged from CML patients expectedly but, interestingly, CML cell lines (such as K562) also showed marked difference with primary CML cells. Several phosphoproteins were elevated in suboptimal patients compared to optimal response group. Most prominent differences were seen in signal transducers and activators of transcription 5b, phospholipase C gamma-1, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, Hck, and Paxillin. These phosphoproteins were also increased in three additional nonresponder patients studied, but each of them also had unique phosphorylation patterns, such as highly active HSP27 protein in one patient. In conclusion, suboptimal imatinib response is related to increased phosphorylation of several proteins at diagnosis, which might guide the selection of TKI therapy. Furthermore, the activation of additional BCR-ABL-independent pathways in nonresponder patients (such as the anti-apoptotic HSP27 pathway) may reveal novel therapy targets.","['Jalkanen, Sari E', 'Lahesmaa-Korpinen, Anna-Maria', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Rantanen, Ville', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Hautaniemi, Sampsa', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Jalkanen SE', 'Lahesmaa-Korpinen AM', 'Heckman CA', 'Rantanen V', 'Porkka K', 'Hautaniemi S', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120601,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00185-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Sep;40(9):705-714.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.010.

Chromosomal translocations are one of the most common genomic aberrations associated with nearly all types of cancers especially leukemia and lymphoma. Recent studies have shown the role of non-B DNA structures in generation of translocations. In the present study, using various bioinformatic tools, we show the propensity of formation of different types of altered DNA structures near translocation breakpoint regions. In particular, we find close association between occurrence of G-quadruplex forming motifs and fragile regions in almost 70% of genes involved in rearrangements in lymphoid cancers. However, such an analysis did not provide any evidence for the occurrence of G-quadruplexes at the close vicinity of translocation breakpoint regions in nonlymphoid cancers. Overall, this study will help in the identification of novel non-B DNA targets that may be responsible for generation of chromosomal translocations in cancer.","['Katapadi, Vijeth K', 'Nambiar, Mridula', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Katapadi VK', 'Nambiar M', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore-560 012, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0888-7543(12)00101-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2012 Aug;100(2):72-80. doi: 10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.05.008.

From the introduction of the anti-cancer drug imatinib, the therapy of CML has been positively transformed. However, following treatment most patients display a residual CML disease attributed to the presence of quiescent leukemic stem cells intrinsically resistant to imatinib. Considering that the later cancer cells lose their chemoresistance in vitro, it appears that the stromal microenvironment plays a crucial role in CML-affected cell chemoresistance. In the present review, we summarize and discuss the recent findings on signaling pathways through which stromal cells sustain CML leukemogenesis, as well as leukemic stem cell maintenance and chemoresistance.","['Seke Etet, P F', 'Vecchio, L', 'Nwabo Kamdje, A H']","['Seke Etet PF', 'Vecchio L', 'Nwabo Kamdje AH']","['Department of Basic Health Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, 51452 Al-Qaseem, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120531,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,,2012/06/05 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00162-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Sep;24(9):1883-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.05.015.

Topotecan dosing based on simultaneous drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic analysis can yield more accurate and precise estimation of the topotecan systemic exposure than that attainable with the fixed dosing approach. Therefore, a combined approach could provide a tool assisting the clinicians in individualization of the topotecan dosing. The aim of the study was to estimate the topotecan exposure in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on the plasma concentration-time data and using the pharmacokinetic analysis. The primary goal was achieve the correct estimation of the target plasma area against the topotecan concentration-time curve (AUC) in a 5 day course of cladribine followed by monitored topotecan in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory AML. A sensitive and selective reversed-phase liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay was developed to quantify total topotecan in the human plasma samples. This method, with its lower quantification limit of 1 ng/ml, was validated over a linear range of 1-150 ng/ml. Under the proposed approach, the topotecan dosing was selected so as to achieve the final AUC value of 140+/-20 ng/ml h. The presented analytical and pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that the proposed approach can be a practical, useful, efficient, and accurate tool for individualizing the topotecan dosing in children with AML.","['Baczek, Tomasz', 'Konieczna, Lucyna', 'Belka, Mariusz', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska, Lucyna', 'Wisniewski, Jakub', 'Niedzwiecki, Maciej', 'Balcerska, Anna', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek']","['Baczek T', 'Konieczna L', 'Belka M', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska L', 'Wisniewski J', 'Niedzwiecki M', 'Balcerska A', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Wachowiak J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Gen.

To examine whether intensive insulin therapy could improve outcomes, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy. Intensive insulin did not improve ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes. INTRODUCTION: Hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, with methylprednisolone premedication) chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control). Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level >180 mg/dL on >/=2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled. RESULTS: The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I/C) > 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS. In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age >/= 60 years (P = .0002), I/C >/= 0.175 (P = .0016), and average glucose level >/= 180 mg/dL (P = .0236). Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age >/= 60 years (P = .0008), I/C >/= 0.175 (P = .0002), high systemic risk (P = .0173) and average glucose level >/= 180 mg/dL (P = .0249). I/C >/= 0.175 was the only significant (P = .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration. CONCLUSIONS: A glargine-plus-aspart intensive insulin regimen did not improve ALL outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Exogenous insulin may be associated with poor outcomes, whereas metformin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with improved outcomes. Analysis of these results suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes.","['Vu, Khanh', 'Busaidy, Naifa', 'Cabanillas, Maria E', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Broglio, Kristine', 'Ensor, Joe', 'Escalante, Carmen', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Lavis, Victor', 'Yeung, Sai-Ching Jim']","['Vu K', 'Busaidy N', 'Cabanillas ME', 'Konopleva M', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Broglio K', 'Ensor J', 'Escalante C', 'Andreeff M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Lavis V', 'Yeung SC']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120601,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,PMC3974971,2012/06/05 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00085-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Oct;12(5):355-62. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.05.004.

Therefore, to restore fertility in these patients, we aim to develop a biodegradable artificial ovary that offers an environment where isolated follicles and ovarian cells (OCs) can survive and grow. Four NMRI mice were ovariectomized and their ovaries used to isolate OCs. Groups of 50,000 OCs were embedded in an alginate-matrigel matrix for further fixation (fresh controls), one week of in vitro culture (IVC) or heterotopic autografting. OC proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), scaffold degradation, vessel formation (CD34) and inflammation (CD45) were analyzed. Ki67-positive OCs were found in 2.3%, 9.0% and 15.5% cells of cases in fresh, IVC and grafted beads respectively, while cells were TUNEL-positive in 0%, 1.5% and 6.9% of cases. After IVC or grafting, the beads degraded, losing their original round aspect, and infiltrating blood capillaries could be observed in the grafted beads. CD34-positive cells and 22% CD45-positive cells were found around and inside the matrix. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that an alginate-based matrix is a promising proposition to graft isolated OCs. After transplantation, this matrix was able to degrade, allowed vascularization and elicited a low inflammatory response.","['Vanacker, Julie', 'Luyckx, Valerie', 'Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine', 'Des Rieux, Anne', 'Jaeger, Jonathan', 'Van Langendonckt, Anne', 'Donnez, Jacques', 'Amorim, Christiani A']","['Vanacker J', 'Luyckx V', 'Dolmans MM', 'Des Rieux A', 'Jaeger J', 'Van Langendonckt A', 'Donnez J', 'Amorim CA']","['Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Avenue Emmanuel Mounier 52, bte B1.52.02, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120531,Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(12)00532-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2012 Sep;33(26):6079-85. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.015.

Microarray analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of Rad (Ras associated with diabetes) were higher in the bortezomib-resistant Jurkat (Jurkat-R) cells than in the parental control cells. The importance of Rad for bortezomib resistance was supported by three observations. First, Rad knockdown overcame bortezomib resistance and induced mitochondrial apoptosis via Noxa/Bcl-2 modulation. Second, Rad decreased cell death in response to bortezomib. Third, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (K-562, Raji, IM-9 and Jurkat-R) with elevated Rad expression levels showed higher degrees of bortezomib resistance versus those (Sup-B15, JVM-2, U266 and Jurkat) with low Rad expression levels (r=0.48, P=0.0004).

However, the number of known mutations in acute myeloid leukemia is expanding rapidly. Therefore, we tested a high-throughput screening method for acute myeloid leukemia mutation analysis using a multiplex mass spectrometry-based approach. To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of this approach to genotype leukemias in a clinical setting. One hundred seven acute myeloid leukemia cases were screened for mutations using a panel that covers 344 point mutations across 31 genes known to be associated with leukemia. The analysis was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for mutations in genes of interest followed by primer extension reactions. Products were analyzed on a Sequenom MassARRAY system (San Diego, CA). The multiplex panel yielded mutations in 58% of acute myeloid leukemia cases with normal cytogenetics and 21% of cases with abnormal cytogenetics. Cytogenetics and routine polymerase chain reaction-based screening of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, and KIT was also performed on a subset of cases. When combined with the results of these standard polymerase chain reaction-based tests, the mutation frequency reached 78% in cases with normal cytogenetics. Of these, 42% harbored multiple mutations primarily involving NPM1 with NRAS, KRAS, CEBPA, PTPN11, IDH1, or FLT3. In contrast, cases with abnormal cytogenetics rarely harbored more than 1 mutation (1.5%), suggesting different underlying biology.

Recent studies from the United States and Germany suggest a possible etiological association between Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and CLL, although no data have been reported from Eastern countries. To increase the volume of relevant data, this study investigated the prevalence and DNA loads of MCPyV and human polyomavirus 9 (HPyV9), another lymphotropic polyomavirus, in Japanese CLL cases. FINDINGS: We found that 9/27 CLL cases (33.3 %) were positive for MCPyV using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The viral DNA loads ranged from 0.000017 to 0.0012 copies per cell. All cases were negative for HPyV9. One MCPyV-positive CLL case was evaluated by mutational analysis of the large T (LT) gene, which indicated the presence of wild-type MCPyV without a nucleotide deletion. DNA sequence analysis of the entire small T (ST) gene and the partial LT gene revealed that a Japanese MCPyV isolate, designated CLL-JK, had two nucleotide gaps when compared with the reference sequence of the North American isolate MCC350. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that MCPyV is present in a subset of Japanese CLL cases with low viral DNA loads. MCPyV and HPyV9 are unlikely to contribute directly to the development of CLL in the majority of Japanese cases. MCPyV isolated from the Japanese CLL cases may constitute an Asian group and its pathogenicity needs to be clarified in future studies.","['Imajoh, Masayuki', 'Hashida, Yumiko', 'Taniguchi, Ayuko', 'Kamioka, Mikio', 'Daibata, Masanori']","['Imajoh M', 'Hashida Y', 'Taniguchi A', 'Kamioka M', 'Daibata M']","['Department of Microbiology and Infection, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120601,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC3407023,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-25 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jun 1;5:25. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-25.,20121220,10.1186/1756-8722-5-25 [doi],,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Merkel Cells/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*complications/genetics/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/genetics/virology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Viral Load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma is challenging because of its relative rarity, the lack of an immunophenotypic marker of clonality, and significant morphologic overlap with infectious/inflammatory processes and neoplasms, including Hodgkin and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and even mesenchymal or epithelial lesions. In the current World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic tumors, all except 1 subtype (ie, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma) are recognized as mature neoplasms derived from postthymic T cells. In addition to T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, this review will focus on nodal and extranodal T-cell lymphomas and exclude T-cell lymphomas presenting primarily in the skin. Extranodal natural-killer-cell/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, will also be discussed because the derivation of this lymphoma from natural killer and natural killer-like T cells shows morphologic and immunophenotypic features that overlap with other T-cell lymphomas.

In this work, we studied the effects of a NO donor (AT38) on leukaemic Jurkat cell bioenergetics. Culturing Jurkat cells in the presence of AT38 triggered irreversible inhibition of cell respiration, led to the depletion of 50% of the intracellular ATP content and induced the arrest of cell proliferation and the loss of cell viability. Although a deterioration of the overall metabolic activity has been observed, glycolysis was stimulated, as revealed by the increase of glucose uptake and lactate accumulation rates as well as by the up-regulation of GLUT-1 and PFK-1 mRNA levels. In the presence of NO, cell ATP was rapidly consumed by energy-requiring apoptosis mechanisms; under a glucose concentration of about 12.7mM, cell death was switched from apoptosis into necrosis. Exposure of Jurkat cells to DMSO (1%, v/v), SA and AT55, the non-NO releasing moiety of AT38, failed to modulate neither cell proliferation nor bioenergetics. Thus, as for all NSAIDs, beneficial effects of AT38 on tumour regression are accompanied by the suppression of the immune system. We then showed that pre-treating Jurkat cells with low concentration of cyclosporine A, a blocker of the mitochondrial transition pore, attenuates AT38-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and suppresses cell death. Finally, we have studied and compared the effects of nitrite and nitrate on Jurkat cells to those of NO and we are providing evidence that nitrate, which is considered as a biologically inert anion, has a concentration and time-dependent immunosuppressive potential.","['Hammami, Ines', 'Bertrand, Marie', 'Chen, Jingkui', 'Bronte, Vincenzo', 'De Crescenzo, Gregory', 'Jolicoeur, Mario']","['Hammami I', 'Bertrand M', 'Chen J', 'Bronte V', 'De Crescenzo G', 'Jolicoeur M']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Joseph-Armand Bombardier Building, 5155 Decelles Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T-2B2.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,,2012/06/05 06:00,2012/10/27 06:00,['2012/06/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-2985(12)00100-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2012.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2012 Aug;217(8):808-15. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2012.05.005.

The therapeutic success is still limited by minimal residual disease (MRD) status ultimately leading to patients' relapse. Adoptive donor lymphocyte infusions based on MRD status using IL-15-expanded cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may prevent relapse without causing graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). To generate preclinical data we developed mouse models to study anti-leukemic- and anti-tumor-potential of CIK cells in vivo. Immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgammac(-), NSG) were injected intravenously with human leukemic cell lines THP-1, SH-2 and with human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines RH41 and RH30 at minimal doses required for leukemia or tumor engraftment. Mice transplanted with THP-1 or RH41 cells were randomly assigned for analysis of CIK cell treatment. Organs of mice were analyzed by flow cytometry as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction for engraftment of malignant cells and CIK cells. Potential of CIK cells to induce GvHD was determined by histological analysis. Tissues of the highest degree of THP-1 cell expansion included bone marrow followed by liver, lung, spleen, peripheral blood (PB), and brain. RH30 and RH41 engraftment mainly took place in liver and lung, but was also detectable in spleen and PB. In spite of delayed CIK cell expansion compared with malignant cells, CIK cells injected at equal amounts were sufficient for significant reduction of RH41 cells, whereas against fast-expanding THP-1 cells 250 times more CIK than THP-1 cells were needed to achieve comparable results. Our preclinical in vivo mouse models showed a reliable 100% engraftment of malignant cells which is essential for analysis of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore our data demonstrated that IL-15-activated CIK cells have potent cytotoxic capacity against AML and RMS cells without causing GvHD.","['Rettinger, Eva', 'Meyer, Vida', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Volk, Andreas', 'Kuci, Selim', 'Willasch, Andre', 'Koscielniak, Ewa', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Wels, Winfried S', 'Boenig, Halvard', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Bader, Peter']","['Rettinger E', 'Meyer V', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Volk A', 'Kuci S', 'Willasch A', 'Koscielniak E', 'Fulda S', 'Wels WS', 'Boenig H', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, University Children's Hospital of Frankfurt/Main, Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main Frankfurt/Main, Germany.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120409,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC3356002,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/06/02 06:01,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2012.00032 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2012 Apr 9;2:32. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2012.00032. eCollection 2012.,20120823,10.3389/fonc.2012.00032 [doi],['NOTNLM'],"['CIK cells', 'NSG mice', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'preclinical', 'rhabdomyosarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few data on tracking disease response in patients with rarer retinoid resistant subtypes of APL, characterized by PLZF-RARA and STAT5b-RARA. Despite their rarity (<1% of APL) we identified 6 cases (PLZF-RARA, n = 5; STAT5b-RARA, n = 1), established the respective breakpoint junction regions and designed reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays to detect leukemic transcripts. The relative level of fusion gene expression in diagnostic samples was comparable to that observed in t(15;17) - associated APL, affording assay sensitivities of approximately 1 in 10(4)-10(5). Serial samples were available from two PLZF-RARA APL patients. One showed persistent polymerase chain reaction positivity, predicting subsequent relapse, and remains in CR2, approximately 11 years post-autograft. The other, achieved molecular remission (CRm) with combination chemotherapy, remaining in CR1 at 6 years. The STAT5b-RARA patient failed to achieve CRm following frontline combination chemotherapy and ultimately proceeded to allogeneic transplant on the basis of a steadily rising fusion transcript level.

Our phase 1 study, T2005-003, showed that the combination of bortezomib with vincristine, dexamethasone, pegylated asparaginase, and doxorubicin had acceptable toxicity. We report the phase 2 expansion of this combination in patients with relapsed ALL who failed 2-3 previous regimens. Twenty-two patients with relapsed ALL were treated with bortezomib combined with this regimen; their ages ranged from 1 to 22 years, and they had either B-precursor ALL (n = 20) or T-cell ALL (n = 2). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy developed in 2 (9%) patients. After 3 patients died from bacterial infections, treatment with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and voriconazole prophylaxis resulted in no further infectious mortality in the last 6 patients. Fourteen patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 2 achieved CR without platelet recovery, for an overall 73% response rate, meeting predefined criteria allowing for early closure. B-precursor patients faired best, with 16 of 20 (80%) CR + CR without platelet recovery, whereas the 2 patients with T-cell ALL did not respond. Thus, this combination of bortezomib with chemotherapy is active in B-precursor ALL, and prophylactic antibiotics may be useful in reducing mortality. Bortezomib merits further evaluation in combination therapy in pediatric B-precursor ALL.

It is now generally accepted that BC is the consequence of continued BCR-ABL activity leading to genetic instability, DNA damage, and impaired DNA repair. Most patients with BC carry multiple mutations, and up to 80% show additional chromosomal aberrations in a nonrandom pattern. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved survival in BC modestly, but most long-term survivors are those who have been transplanted. Patients in BC should be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to mutation profile, with or without chemotherapy, with the goal of achieving a second chronic phase and proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as quickly as possible. Although long-term remissions are rare, allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides the best chance of a cure in BC. Investigational agents are not likely to provide an alternative in the near future. In view of these limited options, prevention of BC by a rigorous and early elimination of BCR-ABL is recommended. Early response indicators should be used to select patients for alternative therapies and early transplantation. Every attempt should be made to reduce or eliminate BCR-ABL consistent with good patient care as far as possible.","['Hehlmann, Rudiger']",['Hehlmann R'],"['III Medizinische Klinik, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim, Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120531,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46573-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-380147 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):737-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-380147.

Pluripotency, or the ability to give rise to all cells of the body, is an important characteristic of ESCs. Traditional methods use leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) pluripotency in static and bioreactor cultures. When LIF is removed from mESCs in static cultures, pluripotency genes are downregulated and the cultures will spontaneously differentiate. Recently we have shown the maintenance of pluripotency gene expression of mESCs in stirred suspension bioreactors during differentiation experiments in the absence of LIF. This is undesired in a differentiation experiment, where the goal is downregulation of pluripotency gene expression and upregulation of gene expression characteristic to the differentiation. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine how effectively different levels of shear stress [100 rpm (6 dyne/cm(2) ), 60 rpm (3 dyne/cm(2) )] maintained and influenced pluripotency in suspension bioreactors. The pluripotency markers Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2 and Rex-1 were assessed using gene expression profiles and flow-cytometry analysis and showed that shear stress does maintain and influence the gene expression of certain pluripotency markers. Some significant differences between the two levels of shear stress were seen and the combination of shear stress and LIF was observed to synergistically increase the expression of certain pluripotency markers. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the environmental conditions within suspension bioreactors and how these conditions affect the pluripotency of mESCs.","['Gareau, Tia', 'Lara, Giovanna G', 'Shepherd, Robert D', 'Krawetz, Roman', 'Rancourt, Derrick E', 'Rinker, Kristina D', 'Kallos, Michael S']","['Gareau T', 'Lara GG', 'Shepherd RD', 'Krawetz R', 'Rancourt DE', 'Rinker KD', 'Kallos MS']","['Pharmaceutical Production Research Facility (PPRF), Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120601,England,J Tissue Eng Regen Med,Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,101308490,,2012/06/02 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/term.1518 [doi]'],ppublish,J Tissue Eng Regen Med. 2014 Apr;8(4):268-78. doi: 10.1002/term.1518.

Our understanding of the biology of leukemic stem cells has continued to improve over the last decade and risk stratification using cytogenetics and molecular markers have improved our ability to select patients who would benefit from allogeneic transplantation.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by an autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are early mediators of beta-cell death in T1D. Cytokines induce ER stress and CHOP overexpression in beta-cells, but the role for CHOP overexpression in cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis remains controversial. We presently observed that CHOP knockdown (KD) prevents cytokine-mediated degradation of the anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), thereby decreasing the cleavage of executioner caspases 9 and 3, and apoptosis. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating beta-cell apoptosis and inflammation. CHOP KD resulted in reduced cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activity and expression of key NF-kappaB target genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation, including iNOS, FAS, IRF-7, IL-15, CCL5 and CXCL10. This was due to decreased IkappaB degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus. The present data suggest that CHOP has a dual role in promoting beta-cell death: (1) CHOP directly contributes to cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis by promoting cytokine-induced mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis; and (2) by supporting the NF-kappaB activation and subsequent cytokine/chemokine expression, CHOP may contribute to apoptosis and the chemo attraction of mononuclear cells to the islets during insulitis.","['Allagnat, F', 'Fukaya, M', 'Nogueira, T C', 'Delaroche, D', 'Welsh, N', 'Marselli, L', 'Marchetti, P', 'Haefliger, J A', 'Eizirik, D L', 'Cardozo, A K']","['Allagnat F', 'Fukaya M', 'Nogueira TC', 'Delaroche D', 'Welsh N', 'Marselli L', 'Marchetti P', 'Haefliger JA', 'Eizirik DL', 'Cardozo AK']","['Laboratoire de Medecine Experimentale, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120601,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC3469067,2012/06/02 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201267 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2012.67 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Nov;19(11):1836-46. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2012.67.

The UPS influences the functions of multiple biological processes by targeting key regulators for destruction. E3 ubiquitin ligases are a vital component of the UPS machinery, working with E1 and E2 enzymes to bind substrates and facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin molecules onto the target protein. This poly-ubiquitination, in turn, directs the modified proteins for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. As the UPS regulates the degradation of multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors, the dysregulation of this pathway is known to promote various diseases including cancer. While E1 and E2 enzymes have only been minimally linked to cancer development, burgeoning amounts of evidence have implicated loss or gain of E3 function as a key factor in cancer initiation and progression. This review will examine the literature on two SCF-type E3 ligases, SCFFbw7 and SCFbeta-TRCP. In particular, we will highlight novel substrates recently identified for these two E3 ligases, and further discuss how UPS regulation of these targets may promote carcinogenesis.","['Lau, Alan W', 'Fukushima, Hidefumi', 'Wei, Wenyi']","['Lau AW', 'Fukushima H', 'Wei W']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA081156-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM094777/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM089763/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA081156/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM089763/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20120601,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,PMC3374336,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['4045 [pii]', '10.2741/4045 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2012 Jun 1;17:2197-212. doi: 10.2741/4045.,20121009,,,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NIHMS382996'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This knowledge, along with the identification of the target antigens against which antileukemia immune responses are directed, has provided a strong impetus for the development of antigen-targeted immunotherapy of AML. The success of any antigen-specific immunotherapeutic strategy depends critically on the choice of target antigen. Ideal molecules for immune targeting in AML are those that are: (1) leukemia-specific; (2) expressed in most leukemic blasts including leukemic stem cells; (3) important for the leukemic phenotype; (4) immunogenic; and (5) clinically effective. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on AML-related tumor antigens and assess their applicability for immunotherapy against the five criteria outlined above. In this way, we aim to facilitate the selection of appropriate target antigens, a task that has become increasingly challenging given the large number of antigens identified and the rapid pace at which new targets are being discovered.

We hypothesized that this single-nucleotide polymorphism will predict the development of psychological distress among patients diagnosed with acute leukemia and preparing for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We also explored the relationship of other genetic factors to psychological distress, including 5HTTLPR and STin2, FKBP5, and the CRHR1 TAT haplotype. METHOD: In a retrospective cohort design, 107 adult acute leukemia survivors preparing for HSCT at a major medical center completed a pre-HSCT psychological evaluation and volunteered to donate blood to the HSCT Cell and Serum Research Repository for future research studies. RESULTS: There was evidence of a potential association between BDNF (Val66Met) and psychological distress. More specifically, rs6265 was related to both personal mental health history (P = 0.09, 0.06 adjusted) and diagnosis of depression/adjustment disorder at time of pre-transplant evaluation (P = 0.11, 0.09 adjusted). Other genetic factors were unrelated to distress. CONCLUSION: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may contribute to development of depressive symptomatology in patients undergoing stressful life events, such as diagnosis of acute leukemia and preparation for HSCT. The SNPs in BDNF might be applicable in identifying patients at risk for developing psychological distress and depression in the context of coping with stressful medical conditions. Polymorphism in other genes (FKBP5, CRHR1, and 5HTT) did not show any significant relationships. Replication studies are needed with larger samples of people undergoing similar significant life stressors.","['Romanowicz, Magdalena', 'Ehlers, Shawna', 'Walker, Denise', 'Decker, Paul', 'Rundell, James', 'Shinozaki, Gen', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Hogan, William', 'Mrazek, David', 'Black, John L']","['Romanowicz M', 'Ehlers S', 'Walker D', 'Decker P', 'Rundell J', 'Shinozaki G', 'Litzow M', 'Hogan W', 'Mrazek D', 'Black JL']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. mromanow@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Psychosomatics,Psychosomatics,0376506,,2012/06/02 06:00,2013/01/31 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0033-3182(12)00005-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.psym.2012.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychosomatics. 2012 Sep-Oct;53(5):456-62. doi: 10.1016/j.psym.2012.01.004.

We use our method to probe resistance in four drug-target systems: isoniazid-enoyl-ACP reductase (tuberculosis), ritonavir-HIV protease (HIV), methotrexate-dihydrofolate reductase (breast cancer and leukemia), and gleevec-ABL kinase (leukemia). We validate our model using clinically known resistance mutations for all four test systems. In all cases, the model correctly predicts the majority of known resistance mutations.","['Safi, Maria', 'Lilien, Ryan H']","['Safi M', 'Lilien RH']","['Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120613,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ci200626m [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2012 Jun 25;52(6):1529-41. doi: 10.1021/ci200626m.

Limited data are available for the comparison of peripheral blood stem cells with bone marrow for RIC-alloSCT. We used the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) ALWP data to compare the outcome of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (n = 1430) vs. bone marrow (BM) (n = 107) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients with complete remission that underwent RIC-alloSCT from compatible sibling donors. The leukemia features, the disease status, and the time from diagnosis were similar between the two groups. Engraftment was achieved in 99% and 93% in the PBSC and BM groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). The day of engraftment was significantly earlier for the PBSC vs. the BM group, 15 (1-59) and 19 (5-69), respectively (P < 0.001). Acute GVHD, severe GVHD (grade III-IV) and chronic GVHD did not differ between the groups. leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse, and non-relapsed mortality (NRM) were 51 +/- 2%, 32 +/- 1%, and 17 +/- 1% vs. 50 +/- 6%, 38 +/- 6%, and 12 +/- 3% for the PBSC and BM groups, respectively. Our results indicate faster engraftment, but no difference in GVHD, LFS, relapse, and NRM when comparing PBSC to BM grafts from sibling donors following RIC conditioning. This is the first study comparing PBSC to BM grafts in the RIC setting, analyzing a homogeneous population of patients with AML in remission. Whether PBSC should be preferred for advanced phases of the disease, where the outcome is dominated by relapse incidences, needs further investigation.","['Nagler, Arnon', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Vindelov, Lars', 'Petersen, Eefke', 'Gribben, John', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Malm, Claes', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Socie, Gerard J', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Brown, Paul', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Nagler A', 'Labopin M', 'Shimoni A', 'Mufti GJ', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Blaise D', 'Janssen JJ', 'Milpied N', 'Vindelov L', 'Petersen E', 'Gribben J', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Malm C', 'Niederwieser D', 'Socie GJ', 'Arnold R', 'Brown P', 'Goker H', 'Rocha V', 'Mohty M']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. a.nagler@sheba.health.gov.il']",['eng'],['MR/J006742/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20120704,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01811.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Sep;89(3):206-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01811.x.

FeLV-C arises from the subgroup that is transmitted, FeLV-A, through alterations in the amino acid sequence of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the envelope glycoprotein that result in a shift in the receptor usage and the cell tropism of the virus. The factors that influence the transition from subgroup A to subgroup C remain unclear, one possibility is that a selective pressure in the host drives the acquisition of mutations in the RBD, creating A/C intermediates with enhanced abilities to interact with the FeLV-C receptor, FLVCR. In order to understand further the emergence of FeLV-C in the infected cat, we examined primary isolates of FeLV-C for evidence of FeLV-A variants that bore mutations consistent with a gradual evolution from FeLV-A to FeLV-C. RESULTS: Within each isolate of FeLV-C, we identified variants that were ostensibly subgroup A by nucleic acid sequence comparisons, but which bore mutations in the RBD. One such mutation, N91D, was present in multiple isolates and when engineered into a molecular clone of the prototypic FeLV-A (Glasgow-1), enhanced replication was noted in feline cells. Expression of the N91D Env on murine leukaemia virus (MLV) pseudotypes enhanced viral entry mediated by the FeLV-A receptor THTR1 while soluble FeLV-A Env bearing the N91D mutation bound more efficiently to mouse or guinea pig cells bearing the FeLV-A and -C receptors. Long-term in vitro culture of variants bearing the N91D substitution in the presence of anti-FeLV gp70 antibodies did not result in the emergence of FeLV-C variants, suggesting that additional selective pressures in the infected cat may drive the subsequent evolution from subgroup A to subgroup C. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a model in which variants of FeLV-A, bearing subtle differences in the RBD of Env, may be predisposed towards enhanced replication in vivo and subsequent conversion to FeLV-C. The selection pressures in vivo that drive the emergence of FeLV-C in a proportion of infected cats remain to be established.","['Stewart, Hazel', 'Adema, Karen W', 'McMonagle, Elizabeth L', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Willett, Brian J']","['Stewart H', 'Adema KW', 'McMonagle EL', 'Hosie MJ', 'Willett BJ']","['Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, 464 Bearsden Road, Glasgow, UK. h.stewart.1@research.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['BB/D008425/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120531,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC3403869,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-48 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-48 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 May 31;9:48. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-48.,20121214,10.1186/1742-4690-9-48 [doi],,,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (envelope protein, Feline immunodeficiency virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Guinea Pigs', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', '*Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization', '*Virus Replication']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical characteristics of anemia in lymphoid malignancies and to assess the need of anemia treatment in the context of modern therapeutic possibilities. Fifty-five patients (32 female and 23 male) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 30), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 8) and multiple myeloma (MM, n = 17) were included in the study. The influence of age, sex, type of malignancy and chemotherapy on the prevalence, severity and type of anemia before and after chemotherapy was analyzed. The prevalence of anemia was 51.02% before (A1) and 55.31% after (A2) chemotherapy. Women had a higher prevalence of anemia than men (63% vs. 43%), but the severity was higher in men at the beginning (103 vs. 99 g/L Hb) and at the end of treatment (101 vs. 89 g/L Hb). The highest prevalence of anemia was found in MM (69%), followed by NHL (44.4%) and CLL (40%) before chemotherapy, and in MM (68.7%), CLL (42.9%) and NHL (20.8%) after chemotherapy. The prevailing anemia was anemia of chronic disease (53.8%), followed by anemia due to multiple causes (anemia of chronic disease + iron deficiency anemia or anemia of chronic disease + hemolytic anemia; 30.7%), anemia due to iron deficiency (11.5%) and hemolytic anemia (7.6%). The prevalence of anemia as a consequence of the disease is high in lymphoproliferative disease, but there was no significant rise under chemotherapy, even showing a decline in NHL patients (44% vs. 21%), however, the severity of anemia increased. Since stage 1 anemia according to the WHO prevailed, only a small number of patients required transfusion therapy. About 27% of all patients had hemoglobin values <100 g/L during chemotherapy and could be candidates for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment.","['Zupanic-Krmek, Dubravka', 'Lang, Nada', 'Jurcic, Dragan', 'Ljubic, Nives', 'Bilic, Ante']","['Zupanic-Krmek D', 'Lang N', 'Jurcic D', 'Ljubic N', 'Bilic A']","['Department of Hematology and Coagulation, Sveti Duh University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia. zupanicd@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Acta Clin Croat,Acta clinica Croatica,9425483,,2012/06/02 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/06/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Clin Croat. 2011 Dec;50(4):495-500.,20120625,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia/blood/*etiology/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of bcr-abl led to the discovery and rapid translation into the clinic of bcr-abl kinase inhibitors. Although, bcr-abl inhibitors are efficacious, experimental evidence indicates that targeting bcr-abl is not sufficient for elimination of minimal residual disease found within the bone marrow (BM). Experimental evidence indicates that the failure to eliminate the leukemic stem cell contributes to persistent minimal residual disease. Thus curative strategies will likely need to focus on strategies where bcr-abl inhibitors are given in combination with agents that specifically target the leukemic stem cell or the leukemic stem cell niche. One potential target to be exploited is the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Recently using STAT3 conditional knock-out mice it was shown that STAT3 is critical for initiating the disease. Interestingly, in the absence of treatment, STAT3 was not shown to be required for maintenance of the disease, suggesting that STAT3 is required only in the tumor initiating stem cell population (Hoelbl et al., 2010). In the context of the BM microenvironment, STAT3 is activated in a bcr-abl independent manner by the cytokine milieu. Activation of JAK/STAT3 was shown to contribute to cell survival even in the event of complete inhibition of bcr-abl activity within the BM compartment. Taken together, these studies suggest that JAK/STAT3 is an attractive therapeutic target for developing strategies for targeting the JAK-STAT3 pathway in combination with bcr-abl kinase inhibitors and may represent a viable strategy for eliminating or reducing minimal residual disease located in the BM in CML.","['Nair, Rajesh R', 'Tolentino, Joel H', 'Hazlehurst, Lori A']","['Nair RR', 'Tolentino JH', 'Hazlehurst LA']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

It is shown that TLRs play an essential role in the immune resistance of an organism to bacterial and viral infections. The binding of TLR to its own ligands results in the activation of several adapter molecules and kinases, inducing the activation of the main pro-inflammatory transcriptional factors, which in turn induce the activation of the main pro-inflammatory transcriptional factors. This activation results in the development of both the innate immune response triggered by the enhanced expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides and that of the adaptive immune response, via the activation of dendritic cells and enhancement of antigen presentation, etc. The ability of TLR agonists to bolster the immune reaction makes them promising for use in the therapy of infectious diseases and in the chemotherapy of malignant neoformations. However, different TLR ligands may have either antitumor activity (lipopolysaccharide, imiquimod, CpG) or, conversely, could beef up the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis, stimulating their proliferation under certain conditions (lipopolysaccharide, lipopeptide). It has been shown that the TLR2-dependent signalling pathway in the myelomonocytic mouse leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B leads to the constitutive activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kB, suppression of apoptosis in tumor cells, and progression of myelomonocytic mouse leukaemiain vivo, upon the addition of TLR2 agonist (synthetic lipopeptide Pam2CSK4) or following the infection of tumor cells withMycoplasma arginini.","['Shcheblyakov, D V', 'Logunov, D Y', 'Rakovskaya, I V', 'Shmarov, M M', 'Naroditsky, B S', 'Ginzburg, A L']","['Shcheblyakov DV', 'Logunov DY', 'Rakovskaya IV', 'Shmarov MM', 'Naroditsky BS', 'Ginzburg AL']","['Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Acta Naturae,Acta naturae,101525823,PMC3347616,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/06/01 06:01,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Naturae. 2011 Oct;3(4):83-93.,20120823,,['NOTNLM'],"['Toll-like receptor 2', 'apoptosis; tumor progression', 'mouse myelomonocytic leukaemia cells WEHI-3B', 'synthetic diacylated lipopeptide Pam2CSK4', 'transcription factor NF-kB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulation is provided by alternation of effective stages of proliferation and maturation with inhibition of Ph(+) cell proliferation by accumulating neutrophils under apoptosis blockage. The alternation of stages consists of switching stage 1 (effective proliferation) to stage 2 (effective maturation) and proceeds according to the 1/2 -1/2/1 or 2/1-2/1/2/1 schemes. The kinetic plots of alternations pass through control points of crossing plots, where the parameters of proliferation and maturation are equal. The indices of P/D efficiency (ratio of proliferation and maturation rates) are 1.06+/-0.23 and don't depend on time, alternation order, or sources of Ph(+) cells - CML patients. During stages alternation, conversely, the parameters of Ph+ cell proliferation and maturation vary. The proliferation stages are characterized by increased proliferating cells content, a decreased number of neutrophils, and apoptosis induction. At the maturation stages, conversely, apoptosis is inhibited, the number of mature neutrophils increases, while immature Ph(+) cells decrease. High content neutrophils inhibit the proliferation of Ph(+) cells and impair their own maturation by inversion of maturation order, probably through a feedback mechanism. The regulation differences ex vivo reveal three types of Ph(+) cells from various individual CML patients, distinguished by the number and duration of alternating stages of proliferation and maturation. Ph(+) cells types 1 and 2 have one prolonged stage of effective proliferation or effective maturation with efficiency indices P/D(1) = 1-20 or P/D(2) <-- 1. At the same time period, the proliferation and differentiation of the Ph(+) cells type 3 proceeds with repeated alternations of stages with P/D(1) = 1-4 or P/D(2) <-- 1. Type 1 Ph(+) cells (~20%) were isolated from patients in advanced stages of CML, while Ph(+) cells types 2 and 3 (30 and 50% correspondingly) were isolated from CML chronic phase patients sensitive to chemotherapy.","['Grineva, N I', 'Akhlynina, T V', 'Gerasimova, L P', 'Manakova, T E', 'Sarycheva, N G', 'Schmarov, D A', 'Tumofeev, A M', 'Nydenova, N M', 'Kolosova, L Yu', 'Kolosheynova, T I', 'Kovaleva, L G', 'Kuznetsov, S V', 'Vorontsova, A V', 'Turkina, A G']","['Grineva NI', 'Akhlynina TV', 'Gerasimova LP', 'Manakova TE', 'Sarycheva NG', 'Schmarov DA', 'Tumofeev AM', 'Nydenova NM', 'Kolosova LY', 'Kolosheynova TI', 'Kovaleva LG', 'Kuznetsov SV', 'Vorontsova AV', 'Turkina AG']","['GU National Research Center for Hematology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Acta Naturae,Acta naturae,101525823,PMC3347536,2009/10/01 00:00,2009/10/01 00:01,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Naturae. 2009 Oct;1(3):108-20.,20120823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thyroid hormone (TH) acts through its receptors, transcription factors present in most cell types in the body. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates TH synthesis in the thyroid gland, but seems to have other functions as well in the female reproductive tract. The receptors of both TH and TSH increase in the receptive endometrium, suggesting that they are important for implantation, possible by influencing inflammatory mediators such as leukemia inhibitory factor. The roles of these receptors in the ovary need further studies. However, it is likely that the thyroid system is important for both follicular and embryo development. The association between thyroid disease and infertility indicate that TH and TSH affect the endometrium and ovary on the paracrine level.","['Stavreus Evers, Anneli']",['Stavreus Evers A'],"[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Uppsala, Sweden. anneli.stavreus-evers@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120330,Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,PMC3355884,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/06/01 06:01,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fendo.2012.00050 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2012 Mar 30;3:50. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2012.00050. eCollection 2012.,20120710,10.3389/fendo.2012.00050 [doi],['NOTNLM'],"['TSH', 'endometrium', 'infertility', 'ovary', 'thyroid hormone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several drugs directed at inhibiting BCL-2 and related antiapoptotic proteins have been tested clinically, with some showing considerable promise, particularly in lymphoid malignancies. A better understanding of the BCL-2 family has also provided insight into how conventional chemotherapy selectively kills cancer cells and why some cancers are more chemosensitive than others.

Here we have used FACS with a representative antiplasminogen receptor-induced binding site mAb, mAb49, to examine whether plasminogen associates with peripheral blood cells in blood. Plasminogen binding to neutrophils, monocytes, B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, and platelets was clearly detected. Treatment of whole blood with lipopolysaccharide or 12-0 tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate up-regulated plasminogen binding to neutrophils and in vivo treatment with all-trans retinoic acid decreased plasminogen binding to acute promyelocytic leukemia blasts.

So far, it is not known whether other genetic alterations cooperate with biCEBPA mutations during leukemogenesis. To identify additional mutations, we performed whole exome sequencing of 5 biCEBPA patients and detected somatic GATA2 zinc finger 1 (ZF1) mutations in 2 of 5 cases. Both GATA2 and CEBPA are transcription factors crucial for hematopoietic development. Inherited or acquired mutations in both genes have been associated with leukemogenesis. Further mutational screening detected novel GATA2 ZF1 mutations in 13 of 33 biCEBPA-positive CN-AML patients (13/33, 39.4%). No GATA2 mutations were found in 38 CN-AML patients with a monoallelic CEBPA mutation and in 89 CN-AML patients with wild-type CEBPA status. The presence of additional GATA2 mutations (n=10) did not significantly influence the clinical outcome of 26 biCEBPA-positive patients. In reporter gene assays, all tested GATA2 ZF1 mutants showed reduced capacity to enhance CEBPA-mediated activation of transcription, suggesting that the GATA2 ZF1 mutations may collaborate with biCEPBA mutations to deregulate target genes during malignant transformation.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of specific oncogenes, such as TCL-1, MTCP-1, and ATM in the case of T-cell and TP53 mutations in the case of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Despite the advances in the understanding of the biology of these conditions, the prognosis for these patients remains poor with short survival and no curative therapy. The advent of monoclonal antibodies has improved treatment options. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is intravenous alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as first-line treatment and a significant improvement in survival. Consolidation of remissions with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation further prolongs survival, and the latter may offer potential cure. In B-PLL, rituximab-based combination chemo-immunotherapy is effective in fitter patients. TP53 abnormalities are common and, as for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, these patients should be managed using an alemtuzumab-based therapy. The role of allogeneic transplant with nonmyeloablative conditioning needs to be explored further in both T- and B-cell PLL to broaden the patient eligibility for what may be a curative treatment.","['Dearden, Claire']",['Dearden C'],"['Department of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, Downs Road, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom. claire.dearden@rmh.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120530,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47501-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-380139 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 19;120(3):538-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-380139.

We hypothesized that muscle precursor cells from patients with type 2 diabetes had a deficient response to LIF. The mRNA and protein expressions of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) were measured in skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes by use of qPCR and Western blot. LIF signaling and response were studied following administration of recombinant LIF and siRNA knockdown of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 in myoblast cultures established from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes. Myoblast proliferation rate was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. LIF and LIFR proteins were increased in both muscle tissue and cultured myoblasts from diabetic patients. Nonetheless, in the diabetic myoblasts, LIF-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3 was impaired. The deficient response to LIF administration in the diabetic myoblasts was further emphasized by a lack of increase in LIF-stimulated cell proliferation and a decreased LIF-stimulated induction of the proliferation-promoting factors cyclin D1, JunB, and c-myc. SOCS3 protein was upregulated in diabetic myoblasts, and knockdown of SOCS3 rescued LIF-induced gene expression in diabetic myoblasts, whereas neither STAT1 or STAT3 signaling nor proliferation rate was affected. In conclusion, although LIF and LIFR proteins were increased in muscle tissue and myoblasts from diabetic patients, LIF signaling and LIF-stimulated cell proliferation were impaired in diabetic myoblasts, suggesting a novel mechanism by which muscle function is compromised in diabetes.","['Broholm, Christa', 'Brandt, Claus', 'Schultz, Ninna S', 'Nielsen, Anders R', 'Pedersen, Bente K', 'Scheele, Camilla']","['Broholm C', 'Brandt C', 'Schultz NS', 'Nielsen AR', 'Pedersen BK', 'Scheele C']","['Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism, Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. christa.broholm@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120529,United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

METHODS: Children with AML (n = 314) who were enrolled in 4 consecutive St. Jude protocols were grouped according to BMI (underweight, <5th percentile; healthy weight, 5th to 85th percentile; and overweight/obese, >/= 85th percentile). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (8%) were underweight, 86 patients (27.4%) were overweight/obese, and 203 patients (64.6%) had healthy weight. The 5-year overall survival rate of overweight/obese patients (46.5% +/- 7.3%) was lower than the rate of patients with healthy weight (67.1% +/- 4.3%; P < .001); underweight patients also tended to have lower survival rates (50.6% +/- 10.7%; P = .18). In a multivariable analysis that was adjusted for age, leukocyte count, French-American-British classification, and study protocols, patients with healthy weight had the best survival rate among the 3 groups (P = .01). When BMI was considered as continuous variable, patients with lower or higher BMI percentiles had worse survival (P = .03). There was no difference in the occurrence of induction failure or relapse among BMI groups, although underweight and overweight/obese patients had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality, especially because of infection (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: An unhealthy BMI was associated with worse survival and more treatment-related mortality in children with AML. Meticulous supportive care with nutritional support and education, infection prophylaxis, and detailed laboratory and physical examination is required for these patients. These measures, together with pharmacokinetics-guided chemotherapy dosing, may improve outcome.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Surprise, Harriet C', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Ringwald-Smith, Karen', 'Buaboonnam, Jassada', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Campana, Dario', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E']","['Inaba H', 'Surprise HC', 'Pounds S', 'Cao X', 'Howard SC', 'Ringwald-Smith K', 'Buaboonnam J', 'Dahl G', 'Bowman WP', 'Taub JW', 'Campana D', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC3434283,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27640 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 1;118(23):5989-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27640.

Most patients present with acute myeloid leukemia and their prognosis is poor. We describe the case of a 76-year old woman with an adenocarcinoma of the right colon infiltrating the subserosa synchronous with a myeloid sarcoma at the same site; one pericolic lymph node was infiltrated by both tumors. The peculiarities of this case are the clinical presentation (as an acute abdomen due to subserosa infiltration by the myeloid sarcoma), the coexistence of a myeloid sarcoma with an adenocarcinoma of the right colon, and the absence of progression to acute leukemia. Coexistence of myeloid sarcoma and adenocarcinoma in the colon is probably incidental, and so it appears likely that the two different tumours arose from different mechanisms. However, a possible common background is conceivable. Some authors have found that p53 has a pivotal role in driving the maturation of myeloid stem cells and p53 is, also, involved in colon carcinogenesis. In our case, it may be hypothesized that synchronous heterogeneous mutations occurred in different types of committed cells or in stem cells secondary to p53 loss. Since only one case report has evaluated the correlation between myeloid sarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the large bowel, further immunohistochemical and molecular studies are needed to clarify the pathogenetic relationship between them.","['Rocca, B J', 'Ambrosio, M R', 'Gozzetti, A', 'Bocchia, M', 'Leoncini, L', 'Lazzi, S']","['Rocca BJ', 'Ambrosio MR', 'Gozzetti A', 'Bocchia M', 'Leoncini L', 'Lazzi S']","['Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, Anatomic Pathology Section, University of Siena, Italy. brunojim@libero.it']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14670/HH-27.941 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2012 Jul;27(7):941-7. doi: 10.14670/HH-27.941.,20120921,10.14670/HH-27.941 [doi],,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in myeloma therapies, novel therapies are required to improve patient outcomes. CD47 is highly expressed on myeloma cells and a potential therapeutic candidate for myeloma therapies. Flow cytometric analysis of patient bone marrow cells revealed that myeloma cells overexpress CD47 when compared with non-myeloma cells in 73% of patients (27/37). CD47 expression protects cells from phagocytosis by transmitting an inhibitory signal to macrophages. Here we show that blocking CD47 with an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody increased phagocytosis of myeloma cells in vitro. In xenotransplantation models, anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited the growth of RPMI 8226 myeloma cells and led to tumor regression (42/57 mice), implicating the eradication of myeloma-initiating cells. Moreover, anti-CD47 antibodies retarded the growth of patient myeloma cells and alleviated bone resorption in human bone-bearing mice. Irradiation of mice before myeloma cell xenotransplantation abolished the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD47 antibodies delivered 2 weeks after radiation, and coincided with a reduction of myelomonocytic cells in spleen, bone marrow and liver. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-CD47 blocking antibodies inhibit myeloma growth, in part, by increasing phagocytosis of myeloma cells.","['Kim, D', 'Wang, J', 'Willingham, S B', 'Martin, R', 'Wernig, G', 'Weissman, I L']","['Kim D', 'Wang J', 'Willingham SB', 'Martin R', 'Wernig G', 'Weissman IL']","['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. kimdk1@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012141 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2538-45. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.141.

Because superficially infected fungi in the stratum corneum of the epidermis cannot directly contact with T cells infiltrating in the upper dermis, some perturbation of epidermal innate immunity has been postulated. Interleukin (IL)-17-producing helper T cells (Th17) can induce the keratinocyte production of antimicrobial peptides such as human beta defensin (HBD)-2 and LL-37, which play an essential role in cutaneous innate immunity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the frequency of circulating Th17 cells, serum levels of cytokines, and epidermal expression of HBD-1, 2, 3, and LL-37 in ATLL patients with or without superficial dermatophytosis. RESULTS: The frequency of peripheral Th17 cells and the serum level of IL-17 was significantly decreased in ATLL patients, whereas the serum IL-10 and TGF-beta1 levels were increased as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, ATLL patients with dermatophytosis had higher IL-10 and TGF-beta1 levels and lower IL-17 levels than did those without dermatophytosis. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the epidermal expression of both HBD-2 and LL-37 were significantly lower in ATLL patients with dermatophytosis than in non-ATLL patients with dermatophytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that the keratinocyte production of antimicrobial peptides promoted by Th17 cells is reduced in ATLL patients, leading to the perturbed innate immunity and the frequent occurrence of superficial dermatophytosis.","['Sawada, Yu', 'Nakamura, Motonobu', 'Kabashima-Kubo, Rieko', 'Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Kobayashi, Miwa', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Sawada Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Kabashima-Kubo R', 'Shimauchi T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan. long-ago@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120530,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-0292 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0292 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jul 15;18(14):3772-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0292.

Little is known about B. gladioli infection in newborns. The aim of this study was to present the features of B. gladioli infection in newborns. Clinicopathological characteristics, patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, predisposing factors, and outcomes of B. gladioli bloodstream infection were retrospectively analyzed in newborns treated between 2008 and 2011. During the 3-year study period, B. gladioli was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients (3.7 per 1,000 admissions). In all, 5 (35.7 %) of the 14 cases had a positive blood culture at the time of initial admission. Primary diagnoses in the neonates were severe major congenital anomalies, congenital leukemia, prematurity with respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and parapneumonic pleural effusion. In total, 10 (71.4 %) of the patients underwent >/=2 invasive procedures. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.4 %, whereas the mortality rate due to B. gladioli infection was 7 %. CONCLUSION: B. gladioli might be a causative microorganism of both early neonatal and nosocomial sepsis in newborns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on B. gladioli infection in newborns. Invasive procedures and severe major congenital anomalies may be predisposing factors for B. gladioli bloodstream infection in neonates. Although it appears to have low pathogenic potential and an insidious clinical course in newborns, resistance to antibiotics may be a potential problem. Mortality was primarily associated with underlying diseases.","['Dursun, Arzu', 'Zenciroglu, Aysegul', 'Karagol, Belma Saygili', 'Hakan, Nilay', 'Okumus, Nurullah', 'Gol, Nese', 'Tanir, Gonul']","['Dursun A', 'Zenciroglu A', 'Karagol BS', 'Hakan N', 'Okumus N', 'Gol N', 'Tanir G']","[""Department of Neonatology, Dr. Sami Ulus Maternity and Children's Health and Diseases Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. arzuson2@gmail.com""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120531,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-012-1756-y [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2012 Oct;171(10):1503-9. doi: 10.1007/s00431-012-1756-y.

We examined the outcome of these 190 adult patients. Eighty-four patients (44%) achieved a second CR. The median overall survival (OS) after relapse was 8.9 months with a 2-year OS at 25%. Factors predicting a better outcome after relapse were stem cell transplant (SCT) performed in second CR and a first CR duration >1 year. Risk groups defined at the time of diagnosis and treatment received in first CR also influenced the outcome after relapse. The best results were obtained in patients with core binding factor (CBF)-AML, while patients initially defined as favorable intermediate risk showed a similar outcome after relapse than those initially entering the poor risk group.

Infection of CD4+ T cells by HTLV-1 is therefore thought to play a pivotal role in HTLV-1-related pathogenicity, including leukemia/lymphoma of CD4+ T cells and chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, it has been reported that a proportion of HTLV-1 infected CD4+ T cells express FoxP3, a master molecule of regulatory T cells. However, crucial questions remain unanswered on the relationship between HTLV-1 infection and FoxP3 expression. RESULTS: To investigate the effect of HTLV-1 infection on CD4+ T-cell subsets, we used flow cytometry to analyze the T-cell phenotype and HTLV-1 infection in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of four groups of subjects, including 23 HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic carriers (AC), 10 patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), 10 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and 10 healthy donors. The frequency of FoxP3+ cells in CD4+ T cells in AC with high proviral load and patients with HAM/TSP or ATL was higher than that in uninfected individuals. The proviral load was positively correlated with the percentage of CD4+ T cells that were FoxP3+. The CD4+FoxP3+ T cells, themselves, were frequently infected with HTLV-1. We conclude that FoxP3+ T- cells are disproportionately infected with HTLV-1 during chronic infection. We next focused on PBMCs of HAM/TSP patients. The expression levels of the Treg associated molecules CTLA-4 and GITR were decreased in CD4+FoxP3+ T cells. Further we characterized FoxP3+CD4+ T-cell subsets by staining CD45RA and FoxP3, which revealed an increase in CD45RA-FoxP3low non-suppressive T-cells. These findings can reconcile the inflammatory phenotype of HAM/TSP with the observed increase in frequency of FoxP3+ cells. Finally, we analyzed ATL cells and observed not only a high frequency of FoxP3 expression but also wide variation in FoxP3 expression level among individual cases. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 infection induces an abnormal frequency and phenotype of FoxP3+CD4+ T cells.","['Satou, Yorifumi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Tanabe, Junko', 'Nakagawa, Masanori', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Satou Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Tanabe J', 'Nakagawa M', 'Nosaka K', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. y.satou@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC3403885,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-46 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 May 30;9:46. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-46.,20121214,10.1186/1742-4690-9-46 [doi],,,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (TNFRSF18 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier State/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/virology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/metabolism/virology', 'Viral Load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a systematic comparison of a quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry-based approach (MassARRAY), pyrosequencing and the broadly used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) technique analyzing clinically relevant epigenetically silenced genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By MassARRAY and pyrosequencing, we identified significant DNA methylation differences at the ID4 gene promoter and in the 5' region of members of the SFRP gene family in 62 AML patients compared with healthy controls. We found a good correlation between data obtained by MassARRAY and pyrosequencing (correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.88). MSP-based assessment of the identical samples showed less pronounced differences between AML patients and controls. By direct comparison of MSP-derived and MassARRAY-based methylation data as well as pyrosequencing, we could determine overestimation of DNA methylation data by MSP. We found sequence-context dependent highly variable cut-off values of quantitative DNA methylation values serving as discriminator for the two MSP methylation categories. Moreover, good agreements between quantitative methods and MSP could not be achieved for all investigated loci. Significant correlation of the quantitative assessment but not of MSP-derived methylation data with clinically important characteristics in our patient cohort demonstrated clinical relevance of quantitative DNA methylation assessment. Taken together, while MSP is still the most commonly applied technique for DNA methylation assessment, our data highlight advantages of quantitative approaches for precise characterization and reliable biomarker use of aberrant DNA methylation in primary patient samples, particularly.","['Claus, Rainer', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Hielscher, Thomas', 'Sonnet, Miriam', 'Dahl, Edgar', 'Galm, Oliver', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Claus R', 'Wilop S', 'Hielscher T', 'Sonnet M', 'Dahl E', 'Galm O', 'Jost E', 'Plass C']","['Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. r.claus@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120701,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC3414395,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['20299 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.20299 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2012 Jul;7(7):772-80. doi: 10.4161/epi.20299.

RESULTS: The designed combinatorial library composed from eleven hydrazides A-K and eleven isatin derivatives 1-11 has been synthesized to formally generate 22 mixtures, M1-M22 of 121 Schiff bases, and their antiproliferative activity against K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells was evaluated. The indexed method of analysis of the prepared library was applied to elucidate the active components in the tested mixtures M1-M22. The predictions from the crossing procedure was validated through evaluation of the antiproliferative activity of individual compounds 1-11(A-K) of the library. Individual compounds 1-11(A-K) were also evaluated against the non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cell line to investigate their selectivity. A pharmacophore model was developed to further optimize the antiproliferative activity among this series of compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Variable antiproliferative activity was revealed with the investigated mixtures M1-M22 and the individual compounds 1-11(A-K). Most of the tested mixtures and several individual Schiff bases displayed high potency with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. A considerable selectivity of some individual compounds to the tumorigenic K562 cell line compared with the non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cell line was observed as indicated by their selectivity index (SI).","['Aboul-Fadl, Tarek', 'Radwan, Awwad A', 'Attia, Mohamed I', 'Al-Dhfyan, Abdullah', 'Abdel-Aziz, Hatem A']","['Aboul-Fadl T', 'Radwan AA', 'Attia MI', 'Al-Dhfyan A', 'Abdel-Aziz HA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, P,O, Box 2457, Riyadh, 11451, Saudi Arabia. fadl@ksu.edu.sa.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120530,England,Chem Cent J,Chemistry Central journal,101314213,PMC3523985,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/06/01 06:01,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-153X-6-49 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-153X-6-49 [doi]']",epublish,Chem Cent J. 2012 May 30;6(1):49. doi: 10.1186/1752-153X-6-49.,20121219,10.1186/1752-153X-6-49 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of 91 younger patients (median age 44 years with female prevalence) are reported and compared with elderly patients. Frequent karyotypic changes were trisomy 8 (9.8%) and monosomy 7 (5%). Twenty-three patients had occupational exposure to potential mutagens (benzene and solvents), with a male predominance, higher frequency of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) (52%) and higher frequency of monosomy 7 (21.7%). At a median follow-up of 72 months, 22 patients (24%) evolved to acute leukemia, with higher frequency being observed among the exposed cohort (39% vs. 19% non-exposed). Unfavorable factors for overall survival were: age > 40 years, > 5% of blasts, trilinear bone marrow involvement and intermediate-high World Health Organization Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk. The present results suggest that younger MDS could be identified as a distinct subset.

Our recent data suggest that inhibition of heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) may be an effective treatment for CLL. We sought to further these data to determine whether the Hsp90 inhibitor, AUY922 (Novartis), is effective against CLL cells in a supportive in vitro environment. AUY922 significantly attenuated changes in immunophenotype and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling induced by CD40L-fibroblast co-culture but had no effect on the viability of CLL cells in this model. However, AUY922 in combination with fludarabine was significantly more effective at inducing apoptosis in cells in co-culture than either drug alone, an effect that was irrespective of ATM/TP53 dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen haploidentical bone marrow transplantation is a treatment option in patients with haematological malignancies who have no available human leukocyte antigen-matched donor but is limited by conditioning regimen toxicity, graft failure, relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). METHODS: Twelve patients, median age of 51 years, underwent transplantation with T cell replete bone marrow from a haplotype-matched relative. The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and low-dose total body irradiation. Post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of a single dose of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day 3, followed by oral tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Outcomes reported are overall survival, engraftment and chimerism, toxicity, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: All patients had neutrophil recovery (median 14.5 days), and 11 of 12 had platelet engraftment (median 17 days). Two patients had autologous reconstitution. Seven of nine assessable patients had complete donor chimerism. Four patients had grades II-III GvHD, and none had grade IV GvHD. Four patients developed limited stage chronic GvHD. Five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia relapsed. Two patients died of nonrelapse causes, both from other malignancies, and five patients remain alive and relapse free. Median overall survival was 324 days (range 88-1163). CONCLUSION: This regimen is feasible and well tolerated in older patients with high-risk leukaemia or lymphoma, with minimal short-term toxicity and low rates of GvHD. The proportion of disease-free survivors indicates a graft-versus-malignancy effect is present in survivors.","['Bilmon, I A', 'Kwan, J', 'Gottlieb, D', 'Kerridge, I', 'McGurgan, M', 'Huang, G', 'George, B', 'Hertzberg, M', 'Bradstock, K F']","['Bilmon IA', 'Kwan J', 'Gottlieb D', 'Kerridge I', 'McGurgan M', 'Huang G', 'George B', 'Hertzberg M', 'Bradstock KF']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Service, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02843.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2013 Feb;43(2):191-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02843.x.,20131028,10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02843.x [doi],,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,"['(c) 2012 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2012 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']",,,['Intern Med J. 2013 Jun;43(6):734-5.

As most compounds impact multiple targets and pathways, traditional methods for analyzing structure-function relationships are not comprehensive enough. Therefore more advanced integrative models are needed for predicting biological effects elicited by specific chemical features. As a step towards creating such computational links we developed a data-driven chemical systems biology approach to comprehensively study the relationship of 76 structural 3D-descriptors (VolSurf, chemical space) of 1159 drugs with the microarray gene expression responses (biological space) they elicited in three cancer cell lines. The analysis covering 11350 genes was based on data from the Connectivity Map. We decomposed the biological response profiles into components, each linked to a characteristic chemical descriptor profile. RESULTS: Integrated analysis of both the chemical and biological space was more informative than either dataset alone in predicting drug similarity as measured by shared protein targets. We identified ten major components that link distinct VolSurf chemical features across multiple compounds to specific cellular responses. For example, component 2 (hydrophobic properties) strongly linked to DNA damage response, while component 3 (hydrogen bonding) was associated with metabolic stress. Individual structural and biological features were often linked to one cell line only, such as leukemia cells (HL-60) specifically responding to cardiac glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our approach identified several novel links between specific chemical structure properties and distinct biological responses in cells incubated with these drugs. Importantly, the analysis focused on chemical-biological properties that emerge across multiple drugs. The decoding of such systematic relationships is necessary to build better models of drug effects, including unanticipated types of molecular properties having strong biological effects.","['Khan, Suleiman A', 'Faisal, Ali', 'Mpindi, John Patrick', 'Parkkinen, Juuso A', 'Kalliokoski, Tuomo', 'Poso, Antti', 'Kallioniemi, Olli P', 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Kaski, Samuel']","['Khan SA', 'Faisal A', 'Mpindi JP', 'Parkkinen JA', 'Kalliokoski T', 'Poso A', 'Kallioniemi OP', 'Wennerberg K', 'Kaski S']","['Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Information and Computer Science, Aalto University, PO Box 15400, Espoo, 00076, Finland. suleiman.khan@aalto.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC3532323,2012/06/01 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-13-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-13-112 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2012 May 30;13:112. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-13-112.,20130501,10.1186/1471-2105-13-112 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Biomarkers, Pharmacological', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Genome, Human/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Systems Biology/methods', 'Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether these CLL specific T-cell expansions also occur in monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL), the pre-leukemic state of CLL, which is currently distinguished from CLL by an arbitrarily chosen cut-off value of CD19 of 5.0 x 10(9)/L. Whereas an increase in effector and memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was found in CLL, these expansions could not be found in MBL. Although a significant correlation was found between absolute B cell count (CD19) and T cell numbers, correlation coefficients were rather low. Therefore, we analyzed whether an optimal threshold for CD19 number could be defined which best related to an expansion of T cells. The B-cell threshold that best predicted expansion of CD3 +, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, respectively, was 10 x 10(9)/L.

N(6)-furfuryladenosine (kinetin riboside, KR) displays antiproliferative and apoptogenic activity against various human cancer cell lines and has recently been shown to suppress tumor growth in murine xenograft models of human leukemia and melanoma. In this study, we demonstrate that KR is able to inhibit the proliferation in HCT-15 human colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with a concentration of 2.5 muM, which causes 50% inhibition of cell viability. The cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that KR arrested cell cycle progression in the S Phase by blocking through G(2)/M and G(0)/G(1) phase in HCT-15 colon cells. Moreover, suppression of clonogenic activity occurs after exposure to KR at a concentration of 2.5 muM for HCT-15.","['Rajabi, Mehdi', 'Gorincioi, Elena', 'Santaniello, Enzo']","['Rajabi M', 'Gorincioi E', 'Santaniello E']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche, Alimentari, Farmaceutiche e Farmacologiche, Universita del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy. m.rajabi.s@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/06/01 06:00'],"['2012/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15257770.2012.681825 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2012;31(6):474-81. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2012.681825.,20121123,10.1080/15257770.2012.681825 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (kinetin riboside)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetin/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inflammation of adipose tissue is a key event in the pathogenesis of several obesity-related disorders, particularly insulin resistance. Here, we summarized existing model systems that mimic the situation of inflamed adipose tissue in vitro, most of them being murine. Importantly, we introduce our newly established human model system which combines the THP-1 monocytic cell line and the preadipocyte cell strain Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS). THP-1 cells, which originate from an acute monocytic leukemia, differentiate easily into macrophages in vitro. The human preadipocyte cell strain SGBS was recently introduced as a unique tool to study human fat cell functions. SGBS cells are characterized by a high capacity for adipogenic differentiation. SGBS adipocytes are capable of fat cell-specific metabolic functions such as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis and beta-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis and they secrete typical adipokines including leptin, adiponectin, and RBP4. Applying either macrophage-conditioned medium or a direct co-culture of macrophages and fat cells, our model system can be used to distinguish between paracrine and cell-contact dependent effects. In conclusion, we propose this model as a useful tool to study adipose inflammation in vitro. It represents an inexpensive, highly reproducible human system. The methods described here can be easily extended for usage of primary human macrophages and fat cells.","['Keuper, Michaela', 'Dzyakanchuk, Anna', 'Amrein, Kurt E', 'Wabitsch, Martin', 'Fischer-Posovszky, Pamela']","['Keuper M', 'Dzyakanchuk A', 'Amrein KE', 'Wabitsch M', 'Fischer-Posovszky P']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111214,Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,PMC3355855,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fendo.2011.00089 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2011 Dec 14;2:89. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2011.00089. eCollection 2011.,20120823,10.3389/fendo.2011.00089 [doi],['NOTNLM'],"['SGBS', 'adipocytes', 'adipose tissue inflammation', 'macrophages']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor substructure and its effect on disease progression and relapse are incompletely understood. In the present study, a high-throughput method that uses neutral somatic mutations accumulated in individual cells to reconstruct cell lineage trees was applied to hundreds of cells of human acute leukemia harvested from multiple patients at diagnosis and at relapse. The reconstructed cell lineage trees of patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed that leukemia cells at relapse were shallow (divide rarely) compared with cells at diagnosis and were closely related to their stem cell subpopulation, implying that in these instances relapse might have originated from rarely dividing stem cells. In contrast, among patients with acute lymphoid leukemia, no differences in cell depth were observed between diagnosis and relapse. In one case of chronic myeloid leukemia, at blast crisis, most of the cells at relapse were mismatch-repair deficient. In almost all leukemia cases, > 1 lineage was observed at relapse, indicating that diverse mechanisms can promote relapse in the same patient.

APOBEC3G expression is induced in mitogen-activated lymphocytes; however, no physiologic role related to lymphoid cell proliferation has yet to be determined. Moreover, whether APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase activity transcends to processing cellular genomic DNA is unknown. Here we show that lymphoma cells expressing high APOBEC3G levels display efficient repair of genomic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and enhanced survival of irradiated cells. APOBEC3G transiently accumulated in the nucleus in response to ionizing radiation and was recruited to DSB repair foci. Consistent with a direct role in DSB repair, inhibition of APOBEC3G expression or deaminase activity resulted in deficient DSB repair, whereas reconstitution of APOBEC3G expression in leukemia cells enhanced DSB repair. APOBEC3G activity involved processing of DNA flanking a DSB in an integrated reporter cassette. Atomic force microscopy indicated that APOBEC3G multimers associate with ssDNA termini, triggering multimer disassembly to multiple catalytic units. These results identify APOBEC3G as a prosurvival factor in lymphoma cells, marking APOBEC3G as a potential target for sensitizing lymphoma to radiation therapy.","['Nowarski, Roni', 'Wilner, Ofer I', 'Cheshin, Ori', 'Shahar, Or D', 'Kenig, Edan', 'Baraz, Leah', 'Britan-Rosich, Elena', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Harris, Reuben S', 'Goldberg, Michal', 'Willner, Itamar', 'Kotler, Moshe']","['Nowarski R', 'Wilner OI', 'Cheshin O', 'Shahar OD', 'Kenig E', 'Baraz L', 'Britan-Rosich E', 'Nagler A', 'Harris RS', 'Goldberg M', 'Willner I', 'Kotler M']","['Department of Pathology and the Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['P01 GM091743/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120529,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3398754,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47544-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-402123 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 12;120(2):366-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-402123.

However, identification of novel immunogenic lymphoma-associated antigens that are universally expressed is necessary to overcome the barriers of patient-specific idiotype vaccines. Here, we determined whether T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncoprotein encoded by the TCL1 gene could be a target for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies. We show that TCL1 mRNA and protein are selectively expressed in normal B cells but markedly hyperexpressed in multiple human B-cell lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. We demonstrated that TCL1-specific CD8(+) T cells can be generated from HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2)(+) normal donors and identified TCL1(71-78) (LLPIMWQL) as the minimal epitope recognized by these T cells. More importantly, TCL1(71-78) peptide-specific T cells were present in the peripheral blood and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of lymphoma patients, could be expanded in vitro, and lysed autologous tumor cells but not normal B cells in an HLA-A2-restricted manner.

To better understand its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we profiled survivin expression in samples obtained from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients and in CD34(+)38(-) AML stem/progenitor cells using a validated reverse-phase protein array; we correlated its levels with clinical outcomes and with levels of other proteins in the same sample set. We found that survivin levels were higher in bone marrow than in paired peripheral blood leukemic cells (n = 140, P = .0001) and that higher survivin levels significantly predicted shorter overall (P = .016) and event-free (P = .023) survival in multivariate Cox model analysis. Importantly, survivin levels were significantly higher in CD34(+)38(-) AML stem/progenitor cells than in bulk blasts and total CD34(+) AML cells (P < .05).

We observed that LIF induces rapid, robust, and sustained activation of STAT3 in both the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Here, we tested whether LIF-induced STAT3 activation within the RPE can down-regulate RPE65, the central enzyme in the visual cycle that provides the 11-cis-retinal chromophore to photoreceptors in vivo. We generated conditional knock-out mice to specifically delete STAT3 or gp130 in RPE, retina, or both RPE and retina. After intravitreal injection of LIF, we analyzed the expression levels of visual cycle genes and proteins, isomerase activity of RPE65, levels of rhodopsin protein, and the rates of dark adaptation and rhodopsin regeneration. We found that RPE65 protein levels and isomerase activity were reduced and recovery of bleachable rhodopsin was delayed in LIF-injected eyes. In mice with functional gp130/STAT3 signaling in the retina, rhodopsin protein was also reduced by LIF. However, the LIF-induced down-regulation of RPE65 required a functional gp130/STAT3 cascade intrinsic to RPE. Our data demonstrate that a single cytokine, LIF, can simultaneously and independently affect both RPE and photoreceptors through the same signaling cascade to reduce the generation and utilization of 11-cis-retinal.","['Chucair-Elliott, Ana J', 'Elliott, Michael H', 'Wang, Jiangang', 'Moiseyev, Gennadiy P', 'Ma, Jian-Xing', 'Politi, Luis E', 'Rotstein, Nora P', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Uematsu, Satoshi', 'Ash, John D']","['Chucair-Elliott AJ', 'Elliott MH', 'Wang J', 'Moiseyev GP', 'Ma JX', 'Politi LE', 'Rotstein NP', 'Akira S', 'Uematsu S', 'Ash JD']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA']",['eng'],"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY019494/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY018659/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY019494/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY16459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR024215/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY012231/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY019309/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY012231/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY019309/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY018659/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR024215/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120529,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3397836,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43260-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.378240 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jul 13;287(29):24092-102. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.378240.

Differentiation therapy involves the use of agents with the ability to induce differentiation in cells that have lost this ability, i.e. cancer cells. The promise of differentiation-based therapy as a viable treatment modality is perhaps best characterized by the addition of retinoids in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) revolutionizing the management of APML and dramatically improving survival. However, interest and application of differentiationbased therapy for the treatment of solid malignancies have lagged due to deficiencies in our understanding of differentiation pathways in solid malignancies. Over the past decade, a differentiation-based developmental model for solid tumors has emerged providing insights into the biology of various solid tumors as well as identification of targetable pathways capable of re-activating blocked terminal differentiation programs. Furthermore, a variety of agents including retinoids, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI), PPARgamma agonists, and others, currently in use for a variety of malignancies, have been shown to induce differentiation in solid tumors. Herein we discuss the relevancy of differentiation-based therapies in solid tumors, using soft tissue sarcomas (STS) as a biologic and clinical model, and review the preclinical data to support its role as a promising modality of therapy for the treatment of solid tumors.","['Cruz, Filemon Dela', 'Matushansky, Igor']","['Cruz FD', 'Matushansky I']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC3388185,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/10/13 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['512 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.512 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 May;3(5):559-67. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.512.,20121012,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'PPAR gamma/agonists', 'Retinoids/therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to imatinib is common in patients and has recently been linked to both transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) and elevated Lyn kinase activity, although molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, using leukaemic MYL cell lines derived from CML patients, we show that TGFbeta plays a key role in imatinib-resistance via direct effects on Lyn ubiquitination and turnover that results in bursts of Lyn kinase activity, and identify c-cbl is a candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, blockade of TGFbeta signalling activity with the TGFbeta receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542 significantly reduces Lyn turnover and activation, and subsequently enhances imatinib-mediated CML cell death in a proteasomal-dependent manner. Collectively, our data reveals novel co-operative mechanisms in CML involving TGFbeta and Lyn kinase linked to proteasome function and ubiquitination, and thus supports therapeutic approaches that target TGFbeta pathway activity as a strategy for overcoming imatinib-resistance in CML.","['Smith, Paul G', 'Tanaka, Hideo', 'Chantry, Andrew']","['Smith PG', 'Tanaka H', 'Chantry A']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC3388181,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/10/13 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['500 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.500 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 May;3(5):518-24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.500.,20121012,,,,"['0 (4-(5-benzo(1,3)dioxol-5-yl-4-pyridin-2-yl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dioxoles/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent work has shown that FLT3 activating mutations can collaborate with a Nup98-HoxD13 mutation to induce an aggressive acute leukemia. The leukemic initiating population in this model displayed properties of both lymphoid and myeloid precursors, making it a useful tool to study the role of FLT3 in lineage plasticity. Through a variety of assays, the leukemic initiating population was shown to be restricted to myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the B-lineage properties in these cells are due to the priming of lymphoid transcription programs in multipotent progenitors rather than a true capacity for B-cell maturation. The development of an undifferentiated myeloid leukemia in this model, also has implications for the role of FLT3 in the inhibition of myeloid differentiation.

Levels of monosomy 7 and 8 were significantly increased in subjects exposed to <10 p.p.m. (20%, P=0.0419 and 28%, P=0.0056, respectively) and >/= 10 p.p.m. (48%, P=0.0045 and 32%, 0.0354) benzene, compared with controls, and significant exposure-response trends were detected (P(trend)=0.0033 and 0.0057). These data show that monosomies 7 and 8 are produced in a dose-dependent manner in the blood progenitor cells of workers exposed to benzene, and may be mechanistically relevant biomarkers of early effect for benzene and other leukemogens.","['Zhang, L', 'Lan, Q', 'Ji, Z', 'Li, G', 'Shen, M', 'Vermeulen, R', 'Guo, W', 'Hubbard, A E', 'McHale, C M', 'Rappaport, S M', 'Hayes, R B', 'Linet, M S', 'Yin, S', 'Smith, M T', 'Rothman, N']","['Zhang L', 'Lan Q', 'Ji Z', 'Li G', 'Shen M', 'Vermeulen R', 'Guo W', 'Hubbard AE', 'McHale CM', 'Rappaport SM', 'Hayes RB', 'Linet MS', 'Yin S', 'Smith MT', 'Rothman N']","['School of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES05948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3472034,2012/05/31 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012143 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.143 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2494-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.143.

This suggests that malignant outgrowth of mature T lymphocytes is well controlled. Indeed, in a previous study we found that mature T cells are resistant to transformation with known T-cell oncogenes. Here, however, we observed that T-cell receptor (TCR) mono-/oligoclonal mature T cells from TCR transgenic (tg) mice (OT-I, P14) expressing the oncogenes NPM/ALK or DeltaTrkA readily developed MTCLs in T-cell-deficient recipients. Analysis of cell surface markers largely ruled out that TCR tg lymphomas were derived from T-cell precursors. Furthermore, cotransplanted non-modified TCR polyclonal T cells suppressed malignant outgrowth of oncogene expressing TCR tg T lymphocytes. A dominant role of an anti-leukemic immune response or Tregs in the control of MTCLs seems unlikely as naive T cells derived from oncogene expressing stem cells, which should be tolerant to leukemic antigens, as well as purified CD4 and CD8 were resistant to transformation. However, our results are in line with a model in which homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize the diversity of the normal T-cell repertoire, for example, clonal competition, also control the outgrowth of potentially malignant T-cell clones. This study introduces a new innate mechanism of lymphoma control.","['Newrzela, S', 'Al-Ghaili, N', 'Heinrich, T', 'Petkova, M', 'Hartmann, S', 'Rengstl, B', 'Kumar, A', 'Jack, H-M', 'Gerdes, S', 'Roeder, I', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'von Laer, D']","['Newrzela S', 'Al-Ghaili N', 'Heinrich T', 'Petkova M', 'Hartmann S', 'Rengstl B', 'Kumar A', 'Jack HM', 'Gerdes S', 'Roeder I', 'Hansmann ML', 'von Laer D']","['Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/05/31 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012142 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2499-507. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.142.

Similar masses were seen in skeletal muscles, lymph nodes, and kidneys. Cytology revealed large numbers of round cells with round nuclei and scant cytoplasm (myelocytes); some of these cells had a fine eosinophilic granularity to their cytoplasm (eosinophil myelocytes). Histologically, the neoplastic cells formed sheets that completely obliterated the normal architecture of subperiosteal bone marrow. The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells stained strongly by Sirius red stain of eosinophil and was positively marked by immunohistochemistry using an anti-myeloperoxidase antibody.

Combination use of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) and proteasome inhibitors may provide a potential way to overcome drug resistance. One of the HDACIs, valproic acid (VPA), and a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BOR), were assessed. Co-exposure of cells to VPA and BOR inhibited proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in G0-G1 phase and induced apoptosis in both HL60 and HL60A cells. These events were accompanied by the inhibition of cyclin D1 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as well as telomerase activity. Moreover, synergism of proliferation inhibition was found in HL60A, superior to the additivity in HL60. The effects of combination treatment on cell cycle arrest and telomerase activity inhibition in HL60A were also more striking than those in HL60. In summary, our findings provide an insight into future clinical applications of the VPA-BOR combination regimen for AML, especially in those cases which are resistant to conventional chemotherapy.","['Nie, Danian', 'Huang, Kezhi', 'Yin, Songmei', 'Li, Yiqing', 'Xie, Shuangfeng', 'Ma, Liping', 'Wang, Xiuju', 'Wu, Yudan', 'Xiao, Jie']","['Nie D', 'Huang K', 'Yin S', 'Li Y', 'Xie S', 'Ma L', 'Wang X', 'Wu Y', 'Xiao J']","['Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120618,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/05/31 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.698273 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Dec;53(12):2487-95. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.698273.

Because routine Sanger sequencing of the 23 DNMT3A exons is impractical in clinical laboratories, we developed a high-throughput method using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, which identifies sequence variants by detecting subtle changes in the melting patterns of mutant DNA in comparison with WT sequences. DNA from 104 acute myeloid leukemia patients was tested for mutations in 12 exons encoding 3 major functional domains of DNMT3A: the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain (exons 8 to 10), the ADD (ATM-DNMT3-DNMT3L) zinc finger, and the methyltransferase domains encoded by exons 15 to 23. HRM analysis identified 20 of 104 patient samples as variants, which we confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Codon 882 of exon 23 was mutated at the highest frequency with an occurrence rate of 11.5%. All HRM WT calls were confirmed to be devoid of mutations by Sanger sequencing. We also identified seven novel and previously unreported DNMT3A mutations. Structural modeling showed seven of the eight missense mutations detected in our study increased the free energy, destabilized protein, and altered solvent accessibility, suggesting their loss-of-function nature. These data demonstrate HRM analysis to be a higher throughput, sensitive, and efficient alternative to Sanger sequencing for detecting DNMT3A mutations in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.","['Singh, Rajesh R', 'Bains, Ashish', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Rahimi, Hamed', 'Barkoh, Bedia A', 'Paladugu, Abhaya', 'Bisrat, Tigist', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi']","['Singh RR', 'Bains A', 'Patel KP', 'Rahimi H', 'Barkoh BA', 'Paladugu A', 'Bisrat T', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Luthra R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120527,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,PMC5707199,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(12)00104-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2012.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2012 Jul;14(4):336-45. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2012.02.009.

The numbers of OM9;22 cells significantly increased with S9 cells. Treatment of OM9;22 cells with GDC-0449 caused cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. Moreover, GDC-0449 inhibited the colony growth of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive primary samples. We next investigated the effects of a combination of GDC-0449 and dasatinib on these cell lines. The growth inhibition typically promoted by dasatinib was significantly reduced in the presence of S9 cells. Treatment of Ph-positive leukemia cells with GDC-0449 and dasatinib in the presence of S9 caused significantly more cytotoxicity than that caused by each drug alone. Inhibition of Gli1 or Gli2 by siRNA transfection reduced the growth of the Ph-positive cell line K562 and increased cytotoxicity of dasatinib. Moreover, colony formations of Gli1 or Gli2 knockdown cells were also reduced.

However, adverse side effects and RA (retinoic acid) resistance limit further development and clinical application of retinoid-based therapeutic agents. We report in the present paper the identification of a natural marine product that activates RARs (RA receptors) with a chemical structure distinct from retinoids by high-throughput compound library screening. Luffariellolide was uncovered as a novel RAR agonist by inducing co-activator binding to these receptors in vitro, further inhibiting cell growth and regulating RAR target genes in various cancer cells. Structural and molecular studies unravelled a unique binding mode of this natural ligand to RARs with an unexpected covalent modification on the RAR. Functional characterization further revealed that luffariellolide displays chemotherapeutic potentials for overcoming RA resistance in colon cancer cells, suggesting that luffariellolide may represent a unique template for designing novel non-retinoid compounds with advantages over current RA drugs.","['Wang, Shanshan', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Lin, Shengchen', 'Zheng, Weili', 'Wang, Rui', 'Jin, Shikai', 'Chen, Jinan', 'Jin, Lihua', 'Li, Yong']","['Wang S', 'Wang Z', 'Lin S', 'Zheng W', 'Wang R', 'Jin S', 'Chen J', 'Jin L', 'Li Y']","['State Key Laboratory for Cellular Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian 361005, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20120726 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20120726 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2012 Aug 15;446(1):79-87. doi: 10.1042/BJ20120726.,20121029,10.1042/BJ20120726 [doi],,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '111149-87-2 (luffariellolide)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Aquatic Organisms', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Products/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Terpenes/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,,,,['Biochem J. 2012 Aug 15;446(1):e1-3.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: Andrology, Haematology, and Oncology Departments of a Scottish teaching hospital, and patients' own homes. POPULATION: Sixteen men and 18 women aged 17-49 years recently diagnosed with cancer; 15 health professionals concerned in cancer care. METHODS: Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Topics included perceptions of diagnosis; prognosis; future reproductive choices; priorities; quality of information received; communication and decisions made about future reproductive choices; and the role of partners, family, friends and healthcare professionals. Professional interviews examined their role in decision making and that of protocols and guidelines, together with information emerging from patient interview analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Themes identified following analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The primary barriers to pursuing fertility preservation were the way in which information was provided and the 'urgent need for treatment' conveyed by staff. Survival was always viewed as paramount, with future fertility secondary. Sperm banking was viewed as 'part and parcel' of oncology care, and the majority of men quickly stored sperm as 'insurance' against future infertility. Few women were afforded the opportunity to discuss their options, reflecting clinicians' reservations about the experimental nature of egg and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and the need for partner involvement in embryo storage. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gaps in the information provided to young women diagnosed with cancer suggest the need for an early appointment with a fertility expert.","['Peddie, V L', 'Porter, M A', 'Barbour, R', 'Culligan, D', 'MacDonald, G', 'King, D', 'Horn, J', 'Bhattacharya, S']","['Peddie VL', 'Porter MA', 'Barbour R', 'Culligan D', 'MacDonald G', 'King D', 'Horn J', 'Bhattacharya S']","['Division of Applied Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK. v.peddie@abdn.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,England,BJOG,BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,100935741,,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03368.x [doi]'],ppublish,BJOG. 2012 Aug;119(9):1049-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03368.x.

Human CD59 (hCD59) is a key complement regulatory protein that restricts the formation of the membrane attack complex and thereby inhibits CDC. hCD59 is an important determinant of the sensitivity of NHL and CLL to RTX and OFA treatment. Recently, we developed a specific and potent hCD59 inhibitor, His-tagged ILYd4, which consists of 30 amino acid sequences extending from the N-terminus of ILYd4. Our previously published results indicate that His-tagged ILYd4 can be used as a lead candidate to further develop a potential therapeutic adjuvant for RTX and OFA treatment of RTX-resistant NHL and CLL. However, these studies were conducted using ILYd4 tagged on the N-terminus with 30 additional amino acids (AA) containing 6 X His used for immobilized metal affinity chromatograph. As a further step towards the development of ILYd4-based therapeutics, we investigated the impact of the removal of this extraneous sequence on the anti-hCD59 activity. In this paper, we report the generation and characterization of tag-free ILYd4. We demonstrate that tag-free ILYd4 has over threefold higher anti-hCD59 activities than the His-tagged ILYd4. The enhanced RTX-mediated CDC effect on B-cell malignant cells comes from tag-free ILYd4's improved functionality and physical properties including better solubility, reduced tendency to aggregation, and greater thermal stability. Therefore, tag-free ILYd4 is a better candidate for the further development for the clinical application.","['Wu, Lin', 'Su, Sanbao', 'Liu, Fengming', 'Xu, Tao', 'Wang, Xiaoxiao', 'Huang, Yan', 'Sun, Xinlu', 'Ge, Xiaowen', 'Chen, Ting', 'Liu, Huixia', 'Wang, Chun', 'Chorev, Michael', 'Xu, Ting', 'Qin, Xuebin']","['Wu L', 'Su S', 'Liu F', 'Xu T', 'Wang X', 'Huang Y', 'Sun X', 'Ge X', 'Chen T', 'Liu H', 'Wang C', 'Chorev M', 'Xu T', 'Qin X']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated First People's Hospital, China.""]",['eng'],"['R01 AI061174/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,PMC4279449,2012/05/31 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120525-19 [pii]', '10.2174/138161212802430486 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(27):4187-96. doi: 10.2174/138161212802430486.,20130326,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacteriocins)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (intermedilysin protein, Streptococcus intermedius)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacteriocins/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'CD59 Antigens/*immunology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Stability', 'Histidine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Rituximab', 'Solubility']",['NIHMS649868'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ubiquitin degradation pathway facilitates degradation of damaged proteins and regulates the growth and stress response. This pathway is activated in various cancers, including ALL. It has been previously reported that the newly characterized human gene UBE2Q2, a putative member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, is over-expressed in the tumor mass and invasive epithelium in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. METHODS: Here, we have used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess expression of the UBE2Q2 gene in bone marrow samples of 20 children with ALL. Whole blood samples of 20 normal children were used as control specimens. RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed the expression of UBE2Q2 mRNA in 80% of the bone marrow samples from ALL patients as well as in 85% of leukemic normal peripheral blood cells. According to the results of quantitative RT-PCR, the levels of UBE2Q2 mRNA expression in the bone marrow cells of 11 out of the 20 children with ALL (55%) were significantly higher (> 2-47 fold) than those in blood cells of normal children. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the newly characterized human gene, UBE2Q2, may have implications for the pathogenesis of ALL and could be used for molecular diagnosis purposes in the future.","['Seghatoleslam, Atefeh', 'Monabati, Ahmad', 'Bozorg-Ghalati, Farzaneh', 'Nikseresht, Mohsen', 'Bordbar, Mohammad-Reza', 'Rahvar, Mostafa', 'Owji, Ali Akbar']","['Seghatoleslam A', 'Monabati A', 'Bozorg-Ghalati F', 'Nikseresht M', 'Bordbar MR', 'Rahvar M', 'Owji AA']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. seghatolea@sums.ac.ir']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,,2012/05/31 06:00,2012/11/08 06:00,['2012/05/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['007 [pii]', '012156/AIM.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2012 Jun;15(6):352-5. doi: 012156/AIM.007.,20121107,012156/AIM.007 [doi],,,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2Q2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were pretreated with 2 mM VA for 24 h followed by irradiation with a dose of 0.5 or 1 Gy. The effect of both noxae, alone and combined, was detected 1 and 24 hours after the irradiation. Induction of apoptosis was evaluated by a flow cytometry. The extent of DNA damage was further determined by phosphorylation of histone H2AX using confocal microscopy. Changes in protein expression were identified by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Two-millimolar VA increased apoptosis induction after irradiation as well as phosphorylation of H2AX and provokes an increase in the level of p53 and its phosphorylation at Ser392 in 4 h post-irradiation. Likewise, p21 protein reached its maximal expression in 4 h after the irradiation of VA-treated cells. Twenty four hours later, only the p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 was detected. At the same time, the protein mdm2 (negative regulator of p53) was maximally activated.

Here, we show that TERRA accumulates in highly proliferating normal and cancer cells, and forms large nuclear foci, which are distinct from previously characterized markers of DNA damage or replication stress. Using a mouse model for medulloblastoma driven by chronic Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, TERRA RNA was detected in tumor, but not adjacent normal cells using both RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and northern blotting. RNA FISH revealed the formation of TERRA foci (TERFs) in the nuclear regions of rapidly proliferating tumor cells. In the normal developing cerebellum, TERRA aggregates could also be detected in highly proliferating zones of progenitor neurons. SHH could enhance TERRA expression in purified granule progenitor cells in vitro, suggesting that proliferation signals contribute to TERRA expression in responsive tissue. TERRA foci did not colocalize with gammaH2AX foci, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or Cajal bodies in mouse tumor tissue. We also provide evidence that TERRA is elevated in a variety of human cancers. These findings suggest that elevated TERRA levels reflect a novel early form of telomere regulation during replication stress and cancer cell evolution, and the TERRA RNA aggregates may form a novel nuclear body in highly proliferating mammalian cells.","['Deng, Zhong', 'Wang, Zhuo', 'Xiang, Chaomei', 'Molczan, Aliah', 'Baubet, Valerie', 'Conejo-Garcia, Jose', 'Xu, Xiaowei', 'Lieberman, Paul M', 'Dahmane, Nadia']","['Deng Z', 'Wang Z', 'Xiang C', 'Molczan A', 'Baubet V', 'Conejo-Garcia J', 'Xu X', 'Lieberman PM', 'Dahmane N']","['Gene Expression and Regulation Program, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120528,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,PMC3516443,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.108118 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.108118 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2012 Sep 15;125(Pt 18):4383-94. doi: 10.1242/jcs.108118.

While early or deterministic effects result from organ and tissue damage caused by cell killing, latter two are considered to be involved in the initial events that lead to the development of cancer. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the dose-response relationships for cancer induction and quantitative evaluations of cancer risk following exposure to moderate to high doses of low-linear energy transfer radiation. A linear, no-threshold model has been applied to assessment of the risks resulting from exposure to moderate and high doses of ionizing radiation; however, a statistically significant increase has hardly been described for radiation doses below 100 mSv.

Imatinib has been reported to cause congestive heart failure and left ventricular contractile dysfunction in patients and cardiomyopathy in rodents, findings proposed to be associated with its pharmacological activity. To investigate the specific role of Abelson oncogene 1 (c-Abl) in imatinib-induced cardiac toxicity, we performed targeted gene inhibition of c-Abl by RNA interference in neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs). Suppression of c-Abl did not lead to cytotoxicity or induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To further dis associate c-Abl from imatinib-induced cardiac toxicity, we designed imatinib structural analogs that do not have appreciable c-Abl inhibition in NCMs. The c-Abl inactive analogs induced cytotoxicity and ER stress, at similar or greater potencies and magnitudes as imatinib. Furthermore, combining c-Abl gene silencing with imatinib and analogs treatment did not significantly shift the cytotoxicity dose response curves. Imatinib and analogs were shown to accumulate in lysosomes, likely due to their physicochemical properties, and disrupt autophagy. The toxicity induced by imatinib and analogs can be rescued by bafilomycin A pretreatment, demonstrating the involvement of lysosomal accumulation in cardiac toxicity. The results from our studies strongly suggest that imatinib induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction through disruption of autophagy and induction of ER stress, independent of c-Abl inhibition.","['Hu, Wenyue', 'Lu, Shuyan', 'McAlpine, Indrawan', 'Jamieson, Joseph D', 'Lee, Dong U', 'Marroquin, Lisa D', 'Heyen, Jonathan R', 'Jessen, Bart A']","['Hu W', 'Lu S', 'McAlpine I', 'Jamieson JD', 'Lee DU', 'Marroquin LD', 'Heyen JR', 'Jessen BA']","['Drug Safety Research and Development, La Jolla Laboratories, Pfizer Inc., San Diego, California 92121, USA. wenyue.hu@pfizer.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120528,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['kfs192 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfs192 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2012 Sep;129(1):188-99. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfs192.

In a landmark analysis, an early favorable response, defined as less than 10% BCR-ABL-positive cells by FISH after 3 months of treatment, was identified as a predictive marker of an improved long-term clinical outcome. Of evaluable patients, 51% achieved this response. A large majority, 95% of such responders reached complete cytogenetic responses (CCyR) within 12 months and 100% event-free survival (EFS) at 48 months, when compared with 67 and 65%, respectively, of patients with higher breakpoint cluster region - Abelson (BCR-ABL) positivity at 3 months (P = 0.04; P = 0.006). No similar, significant correlations were noted between early disease assessments with PCR of BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts or of cytogenetics versus a 12-month CCyR or long-term EFS. Our data, based on a limited patient cohort, indicate that (i) FISH can effectively be used in the early assessment of remaining Ph-positive cells to identify patients at risk for a long-term nonoptimal response to imatinib and that (ii) FISH may be more useful than PCR for this purpose.","['Ohm, Lotta', 'Arvidsson, Ingrid', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Hast, Robert', 'Stenke, Leif']","['Ohm L', 'Arvidsson I', 'Barbany G', 'Hast R', 'Stenke L']","['Divisions of Hematology and Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Insitutet, Stockholm, Sweden. lotta.ohm@swipnet.se']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120528,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/05/30 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23238 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Aug;87(8):760-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23238.

Changes induced by 2-FaraA in the levels of p53, p63 and p73 in the nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions have been determined in four human B-lymphoid cell lines that are TP53-functional (Raji and IM9) and TP53-mutated (MEC1 and U266). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The B-lymphoid cell lines were treated with 2-FaraA (3 muM, 24 h, 48 h) and viability determined. Protein extracts of subcellular fractions from 2-FaraA-treated cells were analysed by 1D and 2D electrophoresis; multiple phosphorylated isoforms and truncated derivatives were identified by Western blots for p53, p63 and p73. RESULTS: p53 and p63 were present in all three fractions, while p73 was only detected in nuclei. After treatment with 2-FaraA, nuclear p53, p63 and p73 accumulated as multiple phosphorylated isoforms and truncated derivatives. The association of p63 with mitochondria in human cells is novel.

Relapses are generally attributed to the persistence of a small number of chemotherapy-resistant leukemic (stem) cells, a condition known as minimal residual disease (MRD). The eradication of MRD, with the eventual aim of reducing the risk of relapse, therefore represents a high-priority goal of modern AML therapy. It is now well established that the immune system plays a crucial role in the defense against AML. This knowledge has fuelled the development of immune-based approaches to control MRD and, ultimately, to prevent relapse. One of the promising strategies that have emerged in this regard involves the use of dendritic cells for therapeutic vaccination. This review article aims to introduce the reader into the conceptual and practical aspects of DC-based vaccination for AML. Next, we will review the first clinical results obtained with this immunotherapeutic approach in AML patients. Finally, we will briefly reflect on the potential place of DC vaccination in the future therapy of AML.","['Anguille, Sebastien', 'Van Tendeloo, Vigor', 'Berneman, Zwi']","['Anguille S', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Berneman Z']","[""Universite d'Anvers/University of Antwerp, laboratoire d'hematologie experimentale, Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Anvers, Belgique. sebastien.anguille@uza.be""]",['fre'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,2012/05/30 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007-4551(15)30430-6 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2012.1587 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2012 Jun;99(6):635-42. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2012.1587.,20120821,10.1684/bdc.2012.1587 [doi],,,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (WTAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/pathology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Vaccination/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,Vaccination therapeutique a base de cellules dendritiques contre la leucemie aigue myeloide.,,,,,

Because of the closed nature of iron metabolism, the repeated input of packed red blood cells during transfusions inevitably leads to iron overload. Iron overload can cause iron-related toxicity as well as end-organ damage from iron deposition in tissues. Studies have shown that patients with MDS who are TD have shorter overall survival, shorter leukemia-free survival, and higher healthcare costs compared with patients who are not TD, suggesting that iron overload has a significant clinical and economic impact. Iron chelation therapy can bind and eliminate free iron from the body. Although studies in genetic anemias have shown improved clinical outcomes, clinical trials with patients with MDS are ongoing.

We report here that CTSG is directly targeted and suppressed by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Luciferase assays demonstrate that the CTSG promoter is strongly transactivated by AML1 and the AML1-dependent transactivation is suppressed by AML1-ETO. We also define a novel regulatory mechanism by which AML1-ETO-mediated transrepression requires both AML1-ETO and AML1 binding at adjacent sites, instead of the replacement of AML1 by AML1-ETO, and wild-type AML1 binding is a prerequisite for the repressive effect caused by AML1-ETO. Further evidence shows that CTSG, as a hematopoietic serine protease, can degrade AML1-ETO both in vitro and in vivo. Restoration of CTSG induces partial differentiation, growth inhibition and apoptosis in AML1-ETO-positive cells. In addition to t(8;21) AML, CTSG downregulation is observed in AML patients with other cytogenetic/genetic abnormalities that potentially interrupt normal AML1 function, that is, inv(16) and EVI1 overexpression. Thus, the targeting and suppression of CTSG by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AML may provide a mechanism for leukemia cells to escape from the intracellular surveillance system by preventing degradation of foreign proteins.","['Jin, W', 'Wu, K', 'Li, Y-Z', 'Yang, W-T', 'Zou, B', 'Zhang, F', 'Zhang, J', 'Wang, K-K']","['Jin W', 'Wu K', 'Li YZ', 'Yang WT', 'Zou B', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang J', 'Wang KK']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120528,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012204 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Apr 11;32(15):1978-87. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.204.

As chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines expressing BCR-ABL1 utilize an alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway (ALT NHEJ) to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s, we asked whether this repair pathway is a novel therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease. Notably, the steady state levels of two ALT NHEJ proteins, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and DNA ligase IIIalpha, were increased in the BCR-ABL1-positive CML cell line K562 and, to a greater extent, in its imatinib-resistant (IMR) derivative. Incubation of these cell lines with a combination of DNA ligase and PARP inhibitors inhibited ALT NHEJ and selectively decreased survival with the effect being greater in the IMR derivative. Similar results were obtained with TKI-resistant derivatives of two hematopoietic cell lines that had been engineered to stably express BCR-ABL1. Together our results show that the sensitivity of cell lines expressing BCR-ABL1 to the combination of DNA ligase and PARP inhibitors correlates with the steady state levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIalpha, and ALT NHEJ activity. Importantly, analysis of clinical samples from CML patients confirmed that the expression levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIalpha correlated with the sensitivity to the DNA repair inhibitor combination. Thus, the expression levels of PARP1 and DNA ligase IIIalpha serve as biomarkers to identify a subgroup of CML patients who may be candidates for therapies that target the ALT NHEJ pathway when treatment with TKIs has failed.","['Tobin, L A', 'Robert, C', 'Rapoport, A P', 'Gojo, I', 'Baer, M R', 'Tomkinson, A E', 'Rassool, F V']","['Tobin LA', 'Robert C', 'Rapoport AP', 'Gojo I', 'Baer MR', 'Tomkinson AE', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA092584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES012512/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 012512/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120528,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC3752989,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012203 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.203 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Apr 4;32(14):1784-93. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.203.

Nilotinib is an orally available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for chronic myelogenous leukemia that also has in vitro activity against JNK and p38. In this study, we examine its therapeutic potential against hepatic I/R injury. METHODS: The effects of nilotinib on liver I/R injury were tested using a murine model of warm, segmental liver I/R. Serum ALT was measured and livers were analyzed by histology, RT-PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of nilotinib on hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell (NPC) MAPK activation and cytokine production were also tested. RESULTS: Mice receiving nilotinib had markedly lower serum ALT levels and less histologic injury and apoptosis following liver I/R. Nilotinib did not inhibit its known receptor tyrosine kinases. Nilotinib lowered intrahepatic expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-2 and systemic levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF. Nilotinib reduced NPC activation of p38 MAPK signaling and decreased the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and their production of TNF. Nilotinib attenuated JNK phosphorylation and hepatocellular apoptosis. In vitro, nilotinib demonstrated direct inhibition of JNK activation in isolated hepatocytes cultured under hypoxic conditions, and blocked activation of p38 MAPK and cytokine production by stimulated NPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib lowers both liver JNK activation and NPC p38 MAPK activation and may be useful for ameliorating liver I/R injury in humans.","['Ocuin, Lee M', 'Zeng, Shan', 'Cavnar, Michael J', 'Sorenson, Eric C', 'Bamboat, Zubin M', 'Greer, Jonathan B', 'Kim, Teresa S', 'Popow, Rachel', 'DeMatteo, Ronald P']","['Ocuin LM', 'Zeng S', 'Cavnar MJ', 'Sorenson EC', 'Bamboat ZM', 'Greer JB', 'Kim TS', 'Popow R', 'DeMatteo RP']","['Hepatopancreatobiliary Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK068346/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009501/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK068346/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120526,Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,PMC3437237,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/04/03 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-8278(12)00400-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2012.05.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2012 Oct;57(4):766-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2012.05.012.

The CPs were purified using chromatographic methods and analyzed using HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector (FLD) and mass spectrometer (MS). The purified CPs had a purity of 53.1% (w/w) and contained procyanidin oligomers (from monomer to decamers) and polymers, with polymers being the predominant component (26.4%, w/w). Different CPs-gelatin-chitosan mass ratios were tested to investigate the effects of formulation on the nanoparticle fabrication. Using CPs-gelatin-chitosan mass ratio of 0.75:1:0.5, the resultant nanoparticles had a particle size of 344.7 nm, zeta-potential of +29.8 mV, particle yield of 51.4%, loading efficiency of 50.1%, and loading capacity of 20.5%. The CPs-gelatin-chitosan nanoparticles were spherical as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) suggested that the primary interaction between the CPs and gelatin was hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction, while electrostatic interaction was the main binding force between chitosan and CPs-gelatin nanoparticles. Nanoencapsulation of the CPs significantly improved the stability of the CPs at 60 degrees C. The CPs-gelatin-chitosan nanoparticles showed the same apoptotic effects at lower concentrations in human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells compared with the CPs in solution.","['Zou, Tao', 'Percival, Susan S', 'Cheng, Qiong', 'Li, Zheng', 'Rowe, Cheryl A', 'Gu, Liwei']","['Zou T', 'Percival SS', 'Cheng Q', 'Li Z', 'Rowe CA', 'Gu L']","['Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120526,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Biopharm,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,9109778,,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/02/06 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0939-6411(12)00173-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejpb.2012.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2012 Sep;82(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/j.ejpb.2012.05.006.

Leukaemia is one such topic, yet there are no reports on the efficacy of e-learning for leukaemia. This study compared the learning impact on senior medical students of a purpose-built e-learning module on leukaemia, compared with existing online resources. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was performed utilising volunteer senior medical students. Participants were randomly allocated to Study and Control groups. Following a pre-test on leukaemia administered to both groups, the Study group was provided with access to the new e-learning module, while the Control group was directed to existing online resources. A post-test and an evaluation questionnaire were administered to both groups at the end of the trial period. RESULTS: Study and Control groups were equivalent in gender distribution, mean academic ability, pre-test performance and time studying leukaemia during the trial. The Study group performed significantly better than the Control group in the post-test, in which the group to which the students had been allocated was the only significant predictor of performance. The Study group's evaluation of the module was overwhelmingly positive. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted e-learning module on leukaemia had a significant effect on learning in this cohort, compared with existing online resources. We believe that the interactivity, dialogic feedback and integration with the curriculum offered by the e-learning module contributed to its impact. This has implications for e-learning design in medicine and other disciplines.","['Morgulis, Yuri', 'Kumar, Rakesh K', 'Lindeman, Robert', 'Velan, Gary M']","['Morgulis Y', 'Kumar RK', 'Lindeman R', 'Velan GM']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20120528,England,BMC Med Educ,BMC medical education,101088679,PMC3419126,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6920-12-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6920-12-36 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Educ. 2012 May 28;12:36. doi: 10.1186/1472-6920-12-36.,20130104,10.1186/1472-6920-12-36 [doi],,,,IM,"['*Computer-Assisted Instruction/methods', 'Curriculum', 'Education, Medical/*methods', 'Educational Measurement', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Learning', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Students, Medical/psychology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) play a crucial role in membrane dynamics by facilitating membrane fusion, for example at synapses where small synaptic vesicles (SVs) undergo activity-regulated neuroexocytosis, followed by the endocytic re-cycling of SV proteins and lipids. Recent work shows that the assembly protein 180 (AP180) N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain containing proteins AP180 and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukaemia (CALM) not only regulate the assembly of the endocytic machinery but also act as sorters for a subset of SNAREs, the vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs), most notably VAMP/synaptobrevin 2 at synapses. In this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge about the roles of AP180 and CALM family members in clathrin-dependent membrane traffic, the molecular mechanistic basis for their activities and their potential involvement in human disease.","['Maritzen, Tanja', 'Koo, Seong Joo', 'Haucke, Volker']","['Maritzen T', 'Koo SJ', 'Haucke V']","['Leibniz Institute for Molecular Pharmacology, 13125 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120531,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,,2012/05/30 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/05/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/boc.201200008 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2012 Oct;104(10):588-602. doi: 10.1111/boc.201200008.

Unmodified PNAs, R(8) -conjugated PNAs and modified PNAs containing eight arginine residues on the backbone, either as C2-modified (R) or C5-modified (S) monomers, all with the same sequence, were compared. Two different models were used for the modified PNAs: one with alternated chiral and achiral monomers and one with a stretch of chiral monomers at the N terminus. The melting temperatures of these derivatives were found to be extremely high and 5 M urea was used to assess differences between the different structures. FACS analysis and qRT-PCR on K562 chronic myelogenous leukaemic cells indicated that arginine-conjugated and backbone-modified PNAs display good cellular uptake, with best performances for the C2-modified series. Resistance to enzymatic degradation was found to be higher for the backbone-modified PNAs, thus enhancing the advantage of using these derivatives rather than conjugated PNAs in the cells in serum, and this effect is magnified in the presence of peptidases such as trypsin. Inhibition of miR-210 activity led to changes in the erythroid differentiation pathway, which were more evident in mithramycin-treated cells. Interestingly, the anti-miR activities differed with use of different PNAs, thus suggesting a role of the substituents not only in the cellular uptake, but also in the mechanism of miR recognition and inactivation. This is the first report relating to the use of backbone-modified PNAs as anti-miR agents. The results clearly indicate that backbone-modified PNAs are good candidates for the development of very efficient drugs based on anti-miR activity, due to their enhanced bioavailabilities, and that overall anti-miR performance is a combination of cellular uptake and RNA binding.","['Manicardi, Alex', 'Fabbri, Enrica', 'Tedeschi, Tullia', 'Sforza, Stefano', 'Bianchi, Nicoletta', 'Brognara, Eleonora', 'Gambari, Roberto', 'Marchelli, Rosangela', 'Corradini, Roberto']","['Manicardi A', 'Fabbri E', 'Tedeschi T', 'Sforza S', 'Bianchi N', 'Brognara E', 'Gambari R', 'Marchelli R', 'Corradini R']","['Dipartimento di Chimica Organica e Industriale, Universita di Parma, Parco Area delle Scienze 17A, 43124 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],['GGP10214/TI_/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,PMC3401907,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/10/09 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201100745 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2012 Jun 18;13(9):1327-37. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201100745.

One of the major problems of this complication is the diagnosis process itself. CSF cytology is currently considered the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis, a technique which presents various processing limitations, seriously impacting the predictive values. In the last 11 years, studies of CSF flow cytometry analysis done in patients with acute leukemia have demonstrated superiority in comparison with CSF cytology. Although comparative studies between these two techniques have been reported since 2001, no new consensus or formal changes to the gold standard have been established for the CSF acute leukemia diagnosis. The evidence suggests that positive flow cytometry cases, considered as indeterminate cases, will behave like disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, we think there are some variables and considerations that must be first evaluated under research protocols before CNS relapse can be established with only one positive flow cytometry analysis in the setting of indeterminate CSF samples. This paper proposes a diagnostic algorithm and complementary strategies.","['Crespo-Solis, Erick', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Higuera, Jesus', 'Vega-Ramos, Beatriz']","['Crespo-Solis E', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Higuera J', 'Vega-Ramos B']","['Clinica de Leucemia Aguda, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. erickerickmx@yahoo.com.mx']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11912-012-0248-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;14(5):369-78. doi: 10.1007/s11912-012-0248-6.,20130108,10.1007/s11912-012-0248-6 [doi],,,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neoplasm Proteins/cerebrospinal fluid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases are mostly endemic to East Asia and Latin America. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is usually detected in tumor cells, suggesting that EBV plays an important role in lymphomagenesis. At the site of origin, ENKL can be divided into two major subtypes: nasal and extranasal diseases. The advanced disease presentation, highly aggressive clinical course, and poor prognosis of the latter are analogous to ANKL. It is well known that P-glycoprotein, which is a product of the multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene, is expressed on neoplastic cells of ENKL or ANKL. This is a major cause of the refractoriness of malignant lymphoma to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens containing anthracycline. Recent studies, however, have identified that L-asparaginase-containing regimens, such as SMILE (steroid, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase and etoposide), are effective for ENKL. Considering the myelotoxicity of SMILE, its use in the treatment of ANKL needs some modifications, but this treatment scheme is promising in improving the prognosis of NK-cell lymphomas.","['Suzuki, Ritsuro']",['Suzuki R'],"['Department of HSCT Data Management & Biostatistics, Nagoya University, Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-20 Daiko-Minami, Higashi-ku, Nagoya, 461-0047, Japan. r-suzuki@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11912-012-0245-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;14(5):395-402. doi: 10.1007/s11912-012-0245-9.,20130108,10.1007/s11912-012-0245-9 [doi],,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Nose Neoplasms/complications/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutrophils are short-lived cells and apoptosis is considered to be the major mechanism of their death. In the present study, we addressed whether autophagy regulates neutrophil apoptosis and investigated the effects of autophagy inhibition on apoptosis of human neutrophils. We first showed that the established autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (MA) and chloroquine (CQ) markedly accelerated spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis as was evidenced by phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. Apoptosis induced by the autophagy inhibitors was completely abrogated by a pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. Unexpectedly, both MA and CQ significantly delayed neutrophil apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha, although the inhibitors did attenuate late pro-survival effect of the cytokine. The effect was specific for TNF-alpha because it was not observed in the presence of other inflammation-associated cytokines (IL-1beta or IL-8). The autophagy inhibitors did not modulate surface expression of TNF-alpha receptors in the absence or presence of TNF-alpha. Both MA and CQ induced a marked down-regulation of a key anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 but did not affect significantly the levels of another anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). Finally, to confirm the effects of the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by a genetic approach, we evaluated the consequences of siRNA-mediated autophagy suppression in neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells.

Thus, the enhancement of T cell immunity to ATLL through the development of therapeutic vaccines using characterized T cell peptide epitopes could be of value. We isolated and characterized HLA-DR-bound peptides from HTLV-1-transformed T cells by fractionating on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and Edman NH(2)-terminal sequencing and were able to identify five independent peptide sequences. One of the identified peptide sequences corresponded to a fragment of the human interleukin-9 receptor alpha (IL-9Ralpha), which is commonly expressed by HTLV-1-infected T cell lymphoma cells. Using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the identified IL-9Ralpha sequence, we generated antigen-specific CD4 helper T lymphocytes in vitro, which were restricted by HLA-DR15 or HLA-DR53 molecules and could recognize and kill HTLV-1+, IL-9Ralpha+ T cell lymphoma cells. These results indicate that IL-9Ralpha functions as T cell leukemia/lymphoma-associated antigen for CD4 T cells and that synthetic peptides such as the one described here could be used for T cell-based immunotherapy against IL-9Ralpha positive ATLL.","['Kobayashi, Hiroya', 'Kumai, Takumi', 'Hayashi, Satoshi', 'Matsuda, Yoshinari', 'Aoki, Naoko', 'Sato, Keisuke', 'Kimura, Shoji', 'Celis, Esteban']","['Kobayashi H', 'Kumai T', 'Hayashi S', 'Matsuda Y', 'Aoki N', 'Sato K', 'Kimura S', 'Celis E']","['Department of Pathology, Asahikawa Medical University, Midorigaoka-Higashi 2-1-1, Asahikawa, 078-8510, Japan. hiroya@asahikawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120526,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1284-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Dec;61(12):2215-25. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1284-7.

Importantly, it has been shown to have antitumor and immune effects. There is no available information on ABM-affected immune responses in leukemia mice in vivo. Experimental Design. In this study, the authors investigated the immunopotentiating activities of boiled water-soluble extracts from desiccated ABM in WEHI-3 leukemia mice. The major characteristic of WEHI-3 leukemia mice are enlarged spleens and livers after intraperitoneal injection with murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells. Isolated T cells from spleens of ABM-treated mice resulted in increased T-cell proliferation compared with the untreated control with concanavalin A stimulation. RESULTS: ABM decreased the spleen and liver weights when compared with WEHI-3 leukemia mice and this effect was a dose-dependent response. ABM promoted natural killer cell activity and phagocytosis by macrophage/monocytes in leukemia mice in a dose-dependent manner. ABM also enhanced cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and interferon-gamma levels but reduced the level of IL-4 in WEHI-3 leukemia mice. Moreover, ABM increased the levels of CD3 and CD19 but decreased the levels of Mac-3 and CD11b in leukemia mice. CONCLUSIONS: The ABM extract is likely to stimulate immunocytes and regulate immune response in leukemia mice in vivo.","['Lin, Jaung-Geng', 'Fan, Ming-Jen', 'Tang, Nou-Ying', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Hsia, Te-Chun', 'Lin, Jen-Jyh', 'Lai, Kuang-Chi', 'Wu, Rick Sai-Chuen', 'Ma, Chia-Yu', 'Wood, W Gibson', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Lin JG', 'Fan MJ', 'Tang NY', 'Yang JS', 'Hsia TC', 'Lin JJ', 'Lai KC', 'Wu RS', 'Ma CY', 'Wood WG', 'Chung JG']","['China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735411400314 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735411400314 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2012 Mar;11(1):29-36. doi: 10.1177/1534735411400314.,20121018,10.1177/1534735411400314 [doi],,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Agaricus/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Immune System/drug effects/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukins/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite induction of robust MiHA-specific T cell responses and long-term persistence of alloreactive memory T cells specific for the tumor, often these T cells fail to respond efficiently to tumor relapse. Previously, we demonstrated the involvement of the coinhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) in suppressing MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cell immunity. In this study, we investigated whether B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) plays a similar role in functional impairment of MiHA-specific T cells after allo-SCT. In addition to PD-1, we observed higher BTLA expression on MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells compared with that of the total population of CD8(+) effector-memory T cells. In addition, BTLA's ligand, herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), was found constitutively expressed by myeloid leukemia, B cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cells. Interference with the BTLA-HVEM pathway, using a BTLA blocking Ab, augmented proliferation of BTLA(+)PD-1(+) MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells by HVEM-expressing dendritic cells. Notably, we demonstrated that blocking of BTLA or PD-1 enhanced ex vivo proliferation of MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells in respectively 7 and 9 of 11 allo-SCT patients. Notably, in 3 of 11 patients, the effect of BTLA blockade was more prominent than that of PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, these expanded MiHA-specific CD8(+) T cells competently produced effector cytokines and degranulated upon Ag reencounter. Together, these results demonstrate that BTLA-HVEM interactions impair MiHA-specific T cell functionality, providing a rationale for interfering with BTLA signaling in post-stem cell transplantation therapies.","['Hobo, Willemijn', 'Norde, Wieger J', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'Fredrix, Hanny', 'Maas, Frans', 'Schellens, Karen', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Korman, Alan J', 'Olive, Daniel', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Hobo W', 'Norde WJ', 'Schaap N', 'Fredrix H', 'Maas F', 'Schellens K', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Korman AJ', 'Olive D', 'van der Voort R', 'Dolstra H']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102807 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102807 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jul 1;189(1):39-49. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102807.

Despite this success, a proportion of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are, or become, resistant to this treatment. Overcoming resistance and uncovering the underlying mechanisms is vital for further improvement of clinical outcomes. Here we report the identification, development, and characterization of a novel chronic myeloid leukemia cell line carrying the additional chromosomal aberration t(3;12)(q26;p13) resulting in expression of the TEL/MDS1/EVI1 fusion protein, which is resistant to TKIs. Resistance to TKIs was overcome by the co-administration of the BH3-mimetic, ABT-737. In addition, application of EVI1-specific small interfering RNA decreased expression of the TEL/MDS1/EVI1 fusion, reduced resistance to imatinib, and increased sensitivity to ABT-737. Subsequent studies revealed a role for the BH3-only protein BAD, probably via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT-dependent pathway, as pharmacological inhibition of AKT could also resensitize cells to death from TKIs. These findings indicate a novel pathway of TKI resistance regulated by EVI1 proteins and provide a promising means for overcoming resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies displaying EVI1 overexpression.","['Shimada, Kazuyuki', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Hind, Charlotte K', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Shimada K', 'Tomita A', 'Minami Y', 'Abe A', 'Hind CK', 'Kiyoi H', 'Cragg MS', 'Naoe T']","['Institute for Advanced Research, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. kshimada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['04-0427/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00182-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Sep;40(9):724-737.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.007.

We developed a vaccine platform specifically aimed at inducing such responses against HCV antigens displayed by recombinant retrovirus-based virus-like particles (VLPs) made of Gag of murine leukemia virus. Both ex vivo produced VLPs and plasmid DNA encoding VLPs can be used as vaccines. Here, we report that immunizations with plasmid DNA forming VLPs pseudotyped with HCV E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins (HCV-specific plasmo-retroVLPs) induce strong T-cell-mediated immune responses that can be optimized by using proper DNA delivery methods and/or genetic adjuvants. Additionally, multigenotype or multi-specific T-cell responses were observed after immunization with plasmids that encode VLPs pseudotyped with E1E2 derived from numerous viral genotypes and/or displaying NS3 antigen in capsid proteins. While homologous prime-boost immunizations with HCV-specific plasmo-retroVLPs or ex vivo produced VLPs induce a low level of specific antibody responses, optimal combination of plasmo-retroVLPs and VLPs was identified for inducing HCV-specific T-cell and B-cell responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, these results have important meanings for the development of anti-HCV preventive vaccines and exemplify the flexibility and potential of our retrovirus-based platform in inducing broad cellular and humoral immune responses.","['Huret, Christophe', 'Desjardins, Delphine', 'Miyalou, Mathilde', 'Levacher, Beatrice', 'Amadoudji Zin, Martin', 'Bonduelle, Olivia', 'Combadiere, Behazine', 'Dalba, Charlotte', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Bellier, Bertrand']","['Huret C', 'Desjardins D', 'Miyalou M', 'Levacher B', 'Amadoudji Zin M', 'Bonduelle O', 'Combadiere B', 'Dalba C', 'Klatzmann D', 'Bellier B']","['UPMC Univ.

Although EM relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been considered to be rare, recent studies have suggested that it occurs in 5% to 12% of patients who receive alloSCT, accounting for 7% to 46% of total relapses. The incidence of EM relapse after immunomodulation (eg, donor lymphocyte infusion) or a second SCT is even higher. Moreover, patients with EM relapse are more likely to have had preceding acute graft-versus-host disease or chronic graft-versus-host disease relative to those with bone marrow relapse. Collectively, these observations suggest that the preferential occurrence of the graft-versus-leukemia effect underlies the pathogenesis of EM relapse. Establishing an early diagnosis of EM relapse has been challenging because of the immense diversity in the relapse sites; however, recent studies have suggested the usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans in the detection of EM relapse. As a treatment for EM relapse, a combination of local and systemic therapy should be considered, because local therapy alone often results in subsequent systemic relapse. The prognosis for patients who develop EM relapse after SCT remains poor but is slightly better than that after bone marrow relapse. In addition to an early diagnosis with new modalities, clinical studies using new agents that may offer systemic activity while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect are warranted as part of an effort to improve the clinical outcome.","['Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu']","['Yoshihara S', 'Ando T', 'Ogawa H']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Japan. yoshihar@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120524,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/07/10 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00212-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Dec;18(12):1800-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.05.010.

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and sorafenib are widely used as anti-tumor agents against various malignancies. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of IFN-alpha and sorafenib against HCC. We demonstrated that the combination therapy synergistically suppressed HCC cellular viability, arrested cell cycle propagation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Further research revealed that IFN-alpha and sorafenib collaboratively regulated the expression levels of cell cycle-related proteins Cyclin A and Cyclin B as well as the pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). Moreover, sorafenib inhibited IFN-alpha induced oncogenic signaling of STAT3, AKT and ERK but not the activation of the tumor suppressor STAT1. Xenograft experiments also confirmed the combined effects of IFN-alpha and sorafenib on tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in vivo. In conclusion, these results provide rationale for the clinical application of IFN-alpha and sorafenib combination therapy in HCC treatment.","['Wang, Lijing', 'Jia, Dongwei', 'Duan, Fangfang', 'Sun, Zhichao', 'Liu, Xiaojuan', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Sun, Linlin', 'Ren, Shifang', 'Ruan, Yuanyuan', 'Gu, Jianxin']","['Wang L', 'Jia D', 'Duan F', 'Sun Z', 'Liu X', 'Zhou L', 'Sun L', 'Ren S', 'Ruan Y', 'Gu J']","['Gene Research Center, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)00933-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.056 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jun 15;422(4):687-92. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.056.

In our previous publication, we showed that the purification of the c-jun promoter using lambda exonuclease digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) produced DNA with single-stranded tails. Asymmetric PCR can also produce tailed single strands that can be annealed to yield the desired promoter. An effective method uses asymmetric PCR and double digestion. After PCR, first a restriction enzyme, in this case SacII, cuts duplex strands remaining after asymmetric PCR, leaving 5' phosphoryl ends susceptible to a second digestion with lambda exonuclease to effectively degrade any duplex. The resulting single strands are then annealed to produce a duplex DNA with a single-stranded (GT)(5) tail at the 3' end of each strand of the duplex. Unlike the previously described method, this novel procedure produces the desired tailed promoter devoid of any untailed duplex.","['Zhou, Yanwen', 'Jia, Yinshan', 'Jarrett, Harry W']","['Zhou Y', 'Jia Y', 'Jarrett HW']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM043609/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM043609/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120522,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,PMC3398248,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/11/03 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-2697(12)00274-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2012.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2012 Aug 15;427(2):133-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2012.05.013.

Through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HOXA9 transcripts in human leukemia and normal bone marrow samples, we identified a truncated isoform of HOXA9, namely HOXA9T, and found that both HOXA9T and canonical HOXA9 were highly expressed in leukemia cell lines bearing MLL rearrangements, relative to human normal bone marrow cells or other subtypes of leukemia cells. A frameshift in HOXA9T in exon I causes a premature stop codon upstream of the PBX-binding domain and the homeodomain, which leads to the generation of a non-homeodomain-containing protein. Unlike the canonical HOXA9, HOXA9T alone cannot transform normal bone marrow progenitor cells. Moreover, HOXA9T cannot cooperate with MEIS1 to transform cells, despite the presence of a MEIS1-binding domain. Remarkably, although the truncated isoforms of many proteins function as dominant-negative competitors or inhibitors of their full-length counterparts, this is not the case for HOXA9T; instead, HOXA9T synergized with HOXA9 in transforming mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells through promoting self-renewal and proliferation of the cells. Collectively, our data indicate that both truncated and full-length forms of HOXA9 are highly expressed in human MLL-rearranged leukemia, and the truncated isoform of HOXA9 might also play an oncogenic role by cooperating with canonical HOXA9 in cell transformation and leukemogenesis.","['He, Miao', 'Chen, Ping', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Huang, Hao', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Wei, Minjie', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Li, Zejuan']","['He M', 'Chen P', 'Arnovitz S', 'Li Y', 'Huang H', 'Neilly MB', 'Wei M', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J', 'Li Z']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA127277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,PMC3399022,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(12)00092-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2012 Aug 15;49(2):102-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.05.003.

Here, we examined the threshold limits of functional Gag required to package gRNA using wild-type (WT) and packaging deficient mutant nucleocapsid (NC) phenotypically mixed virions. Although gRNA packaging was severely diminished for the NC mutant, the residual encapsidated RNA dimer displayed motility on gels, thermostability, and integrity that was indistinguishable from that of WT. In phenotypically mixed virions, gRNA encapsidation recovered to within approximately two-fold of WT levels when the amount of WT NC was 5-10% of the total. Our results demonstrate that NC's roles in gRNA dimerization and packaging are genetically separable. Additionally, MLV gRNA packaging does not require 100% WT NC, but the amount of functional NC required is greater than the predicted minimum.","['Johnson, Silas F', 'Garcia, Eric L', 'Summers, Michael F', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Johnson SF', 'Garcia EL', 'Summers MF', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM042561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM042561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120525,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,PMC3379553,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(12)00233-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2012 Sep 1;430(2):100-9. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.003.

The REDS-II also included international study sites in Brazil and China. The 3 major research domains of REDS/REDS-II have been infectious disease risk evaluation, blood donation availability, and blood donor characterization. Both programs have made significant contributions to transfusion medicine research methodology by the use of mathematical modeling, large-scale donor surveys, innovative methods of repository sample storage, and establishing an infrastructure that responded to potential emerging blood safety threats such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus. Blood safety studies have included protocols evaluating epidemiologic and/or laboratory aspects of human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1/2, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, West Nile virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 8, parvovirus B19, malaria, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, influenza, and Trypanosoma cruzi infections. Other analyses have characterized blood donor demographics, motivations to donate, factors influencing donor return, behavioral risk factors, donors' perception of the blood donation screening process, and aspects of donor deferral. In REDS-II, 2 large-scale blood donor protocols examined iron deficiency in donors and the prevalence of leukocyte antibodies. This review describes the major study results from over 150 peer-reviewed articles published by these 2 REDS programs. In 2011, a new 7-year program, the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III, was launched. The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III expands beyond donor-based research to include studies of blood transfusion recipients in the hospital setting and adds a third country, South Africa, to the international program.","['Kleinman, Steven', 'King, Melissa R', 'Busch, Michael P', 'Murphy, Edward L', 'Glynn, Simone A']","['Kleinman S', 'King MR', 'Busch MP', 'Murphy EL', 'Glynn SA']","['Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. skleinman@shaw.ca']",['eng'],"['N01-HB-47172/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97079/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47175/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47114/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97081/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HB47168/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97080/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47168/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-57181/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01HB97080/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97078/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97077/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-97082/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120524,United States,Transfus Med Rev,Transfusion medicine reviews,8709027,PMC3448800,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-7963(12)00025-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tmrv.2012.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,"Transfus Med Rev. 2012 Oct;26(4):281-304, 304.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.tmrv.2012.04.004.

The authors describe the experience at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center regarding vascular events associated with nilotinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Overall, 5 cases of PAOD were identified among 233 patients, for an incidence of 2%. Nilotinib is a highly selective inhibitor of the inactive conformation of ABL1 kinase. An improved topologic fit to the ABL1 protein-binding surface contributes to its increased potency over imatinib. This higher selectivity in vitro translated to an improved tolerability in vivo. In fact, nilotinib therapy in the frontline phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study was associated with an improved toxicity profile compared with that of imatinib. Intriguingly, several cases of severe peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) have been reported among patients treated with nilotinib in small series. We have identified 5 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in whom vascular events developed that were likely related to nilotinib therapy among 233 (2%) patients treated at our institution: 1 patient had recurrent Raynaud syndrome, a second patient had recurrent cerebrovascular accidents, and 3 other patients had PAOD (2 of them with other vascular events, including coronary artery disease and pulmonary emboli, respectively). Risk factors for vascular disease were present in only 1 patient with a history of diabetes mellitus. Although the incidence of vascular events is low, this potential complication should be taken into account when selecting nilotinib for the treatment of CML.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. aquintas@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120524,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00083-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Oct;12(5):337-40. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.04.005.

However, for patients to reap the benefits of BCR-ABL inhibitors, they must likely receive therapy for the remainder of their lives. In this situation, adherence to medication becomes a concern. Adherence to therapy for chronic health conditions, including CML, has been demonstrated to be poor. Studies have shown nonadherence in CML to be common in one-third or more of patients, and 100% adherence is rare. Furthermore, evidence suggests that reduced adherence to BCR-ABL inhibitors is associated with reduced efficacy and increased healthcare costs. Factors that can cause nonadherence, including dose, toxicity, time from diagnosis to prescription, and the number of concomitant medications, should be addressed and monitored by the physician.

However, assays for both human CSCs and normal stem cells that are amenable to robust biological screens are limited. Using a discovery platform that reveals differences between neoplastic and normal human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), we identify small molecules from libraries of known compounds that induce differentiation to overcome neoplastic self-renewal. Surprisingly, thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug, selectively targets the neoplastic cells, and impairs human somatic CSCs capable of in vivo leukemic disease initiation while having no effect on normal blood SCs. The drug antagonizes dopamine receptors that are expressed on CSCs and on breast cancer cells as well. These results suggest that dopamine receptors may serve as a biomarker for diverse malignancies, demonstrate the utility of using neoplastic hPSCs for identifying CSC-targeting drugs, and provide support for the use of differentiation as a therapeutic strategy.","['Sachlos, Eleftherios', 'Risueno, Ruth M', 'Laronde, Sarah', 'Shapovalova, Zoya', 'Lee, Jong-Hee', 'Russell, Jennifer', 'Malig, Monika', 'McNicol, Jamie D', 'Fiebig-Comyn, Aline', 'Graham, Monica', 'Levadoux-Martin, Marilyne', 'Lee, Jung Bok', 'Giacomelli, Andrew O', 'Hassell, John A', 'Fischer-Russell, Daniela', 'Trus, Michael R', 'Foley, Ronan', 'Leber, Brian', 'Xenocostas, Anargyros', 'Brown, Eric D', 'Collins, Tony J', 'Bhatia, Mickie']","['Sachlos E', 'Risueno RM', 'Laronde S', 'Shapovalova Z', 'Lee JH', 'Russell J', 'Malig M', 'McNicol JD', 'Fiebig-Comyn A', 'Graham M', 'Levadoux-Martin M', 'Lee JB', 'Giacomelli AO', 'Hassell JA', 'Fischer-Russell D', 'Trus MR', 'Foley R', 'Leber B', 'Xenocostas A', 'Brown ED', 'Collins TJ', 'Bhatia M']","['McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(12)00571-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.049 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2012 Jun 8;149(6):1284-97. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.049.

The binding of GO to the CD33 antigen on leukemic cells results in internalization followed by the release of calicheamicin, thereby inducing DNA strand breaks. We hypothesized that the induction of DNA strand breaks would be a surrogate marker of GO cytotoxcity. Here, two GO-resistant variants (HL/GO-CSA [225-fold], HL/GO [200-fold]) were established by serially incubating human leukemia HL-60 cells with GO with or without a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, cyclosporine A, respectively. The CD33 positivity was reduced in both variants. The HL/GO-CSA cells showed an increased multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) transcript, and an MRP1 inhibitor partially reversed GO resistance. The HL/GO cells had neither P-gp nor MRP1 overexpression. Microarray analysis and Western blotting indicated elevated levels of DNA repair-associated proteins in both variants. Two other leukemic subclones, showing either P-gp or MRP1 overexpression, were also GO-resistant. Using single cell gel electrophoresis analysis, it was determined that GO-induced DNA strand breaks increased dose-dependently in HL-60 cells, whereas the number of breaks was reduced in the GO-resistant cell lines. The induction of DNA strand breaks was correlated with GO sensitivity among these cell lines. The CD33 positivity and the expression levels of transporters were not proportional to drug sensitivity. Using primary leukemic cells, the induction of DNA strand breaks appeared to be associated with GO sensitivity. Thus, GO-induced DNA strand breaks as the final output of the mechanism of action would be critical to predict GO cytotoxicity.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Matsuda, Yasufumi', 'Tasaki, Toshiki', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Ikegaya, Satoshi', 'Takagi, Kazutaka', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Matsuda Y', 'Tasaki T', 'Negoro E', 'Ikegaya S', 'Takagi K', 'Yoshida A', 'Urasaki Y', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Japan. tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120711,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC7659370,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02343.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Sep;103(9):1722-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02343.x.

METHODS: Retrospective case series. RESULTS: We report four cases that required intrinsic optic nerve biopsy for progressive optic neuropathy with uncertain diagnosis after negative systemic investigations. In all cases, a medial transconjunctival approach was used. There were no complications noted with this technique in the series, specifically there was no reported deterioration in vision. One case of neurosarcoidosis was confirmed. In the other three cases, the pathology results were non-diagnostic but ruled out serious causes such as central nervous system leukaemia relapse. CONCLUSION: Medial transconjunctival intrinsic optic nerve biopsy is a minimally invasive and safe technique. The technique is suitable for sampling pathology in the distal portion of the optic nerve. Optic nerve biopsy is indicated when there is significant loss of vision from an isolated optic nerve disease and all systemic investigations have failed to identify the cause, or where the clinical course of a presumed diagnosis is atypical.","['Khong, Jwu Jin', 'McNab, Alan A']","['Khong JJ', 'McNab AA']","['The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Orbital Plastics and Lacrimal Unit, Melbourne, Australia. jwujin.khong@eyeandear.org.au']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120525,England,Orbit,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8301221,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/12/20 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01676830.2012.669010 [doi]'],ppublish,Orbit. 2012 Aug;31(4):227-32. doi: 10.3109/01676830.2012.669010.

By using model membranes and electrophysiology measurements to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective action, the porelike activity of MP-1 was identified with several bilayer compositions. The highest average conductance was found in bilayers formed by phosphatidylcholine or a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (70:30). The presence of cholesterol or cardiolipin substantially decreases the MP-1 pore activity, suggesting that the membrane fluidity influences the mechanism of selective toxicity. The determination of partition coefficients from the anisotropy of Trp indicated higher coefficients for the anionic bilayers. The partition coefficients were found to be 1 order of magnitude smaller when the bilayers contain cholesterol or a mixture of cholesterol and sphingomyelin. The blue shift fluorescence, anisotropy values, and Stern-Volmer constants are indications of a deeper penetration of MP-1 into anionic bilayers than into zwitterionic bilayers. Our results indicate that MP-1 prefers to target leukemic cell membranes, and its toxicity is probably related to the induction of necrosis and not to DNA fragmentation. This mode of action can be interpreted considering a number of bilayer properties like fluidity, lipid charge, and domain formation. Cholesterol-containing bilayers are less fluid and less charged and have a tendency to form domains. In comparison to healthy cells, leukemic T-lymphocyte membranes are deprived of this lipid, resulting in decreased peptide binding and lower conductance. We showed that the higher content of anionic lipids increases the level of binding of the peptide to bilayers. Additionally, the absence of cholesterol resulted in enhanced pore activity. These findings may drive the selective toxicity of MP-1 to Jurkat cells.","['dos Santos Cabrera, Marcia Perez', 'Arcisio-Miranda, Manoel', 'Gorjao, Renata', 'Leite, Natalia Bueno', 'de Souza, Bibiana Monson', 'Curi, Rui', 'Procopio, Joaquim', 'Ruggiero Neto, Joao', 'Palma, Mario Sergio']","['dos Santos Cabrera MP', 'Arcisio-Miranda M', 'Gorjao R', 'Leite NB', 'de Souza BM', 'Curi R', 'Procopio J', 'Ruggiero Neto J', 'Palma MS']","['UNESP-Sao Paulo State University, Center of Studies of Social Insects, Institute of Biosciences, 13506-900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil. cabrera.marcia@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120606,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,,2012/05/29 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi201608d [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2012 Jun 19;51(24):4898-908. doi: 10.1021/bi201608d.

Through presentation of five malignancies - prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, acute leukaemia, bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma - important issues are highlighted, such as risk from bleeding as a symptom of malignancy; risks from invasive screenings and how these should be handled in haemophilic individuals; the implications of chemotherapy and treatment schedules, bone marrow suppression, radiotherapy, or surgery; and the likelihood of an interaction between treatment for haemophilia and malignancy outcomes. Ultimately, the aim is to establish consensus guidelines to direct and harmonize future treatment policy for malignant disease in the haemophilic population.","['Astermark, J', 'Makris, M', 'Mauser-Bunschoten, E', 'Nemes, L', ""D'oiron, R"", 'Oldenburg, J', 'Ingerslev, J']","['Astermark J', 'Makris M', 'Mauser-Bunschoten E', 'Nemes L', ""D'oiron R"", 'Oldenburg J', 'Ingerslev J']","['Centre for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Skane University Hospital Malmo, Malmo, Sweden. jan.astermark@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120528,England,Haemophilia,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,9442916,,2012/05/29 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/05/29 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2516.2012.02846.x [doi]'],ppublish,Haemophilia. 2012 Sep;18(5):664-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2516.2012.02846.x.

METHODS: We identified 27 cases, from a 10-year period, of intracranial tumors arising after cranial irradiation. The original lesions for which cranial radiation was used for treatment included: tinea capitis (1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 5), sarcoma (1), scalp hemangioma (1), cranial nerve schwannoma (1) and primary (13) and metastatic (1) brain tumors, pituitary tumor (1), germinoma (1), pinealoma (1), and unknown histology (1). Dose of cranial irradiation ranged from 1800 to 6500 cGy, with a mean of 4596 cGy. Age at cranial irradiation ranged from 1 month to 43 years, with a mean of 13.4 years. RESULTS: Latency between radiotherapy and diagnosis of a radiation-induced neoplasm ranged from 4 to 47 years (mean 18.8 years). Radiation-induced tumors included: meningiomas (14), sarcomas (7), malignant astrocytomas (4), and medulloblastomas (2). Data were analyzed to evaluate possible correlations between gender, age at irradiation, dose of irradiation, latency, use of chemotherapy, and radiation-induced neoplasm histology. Significant correlations existed between age at cranial irradiation and development of either a benign neoplasm (mean age 8.5 years) versus a malignant neoplasm (mean age 20.3; P = 0.012), and development of either a meningioma (mean age 7.0 years) or a sarcoma (mean age 27.4 years; P = 0.0001). There was also a significant positive correlation between latency and development of either a meningioma (mean latency 21.8 years) or a sarcoma (mean latency 7.7 years; P = 0.001). The correlation between dose of cranial irradiation and development of either a meningioma (mean dose 4128 cGy) or a sarcoma (mean dose 5631 cGy) approached significance (P = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that younger patients had a longer latency period and were more likely to have lower-grade lesions (e.g. meningiomas) as a secondary neoplasm, while older patients had a shorter latency period and were more likely to have higher-grade lesions (e.g. sarcomas).","['Chowdhary, Abhineet', 'Spence, Alex M', 'Sales, Lindsay', 'Rostomily, Robert C', 'Rockhill, Jason K', 'Silbergeld, Daniel L']","['Chowdhary A', 'Spence AM', 'Sales L', 'Rostomily RC', 'Rockhill JK', 'Silbergeld DL']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120514,United States,Surg Neurol Int,Surgical neurology international,101535836,PMC3356990,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/05/26 06:01,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2152-7806.96068 [doi]', 'SNI-3-48 [pii]']",ppublish,Surg Neurol Int. 2012;3:48. doi: 10.4103/2152-7806.96068.

Typically, TRIM proteins contain a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain and the more variable C-terminal domains. TRIM16 does not have a RING domain but does harbour two B-box domains. Here we showed that TRIM16 homodimerized through its coiled-coil domain and heterodimerized with other TRIM family members; TRIM24, Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein and Midline-1 (MID1). Although, TRIM16 has no classic RING domain, three-dimensional modelling of TRIM16 suggested that its B-box domains adopts RING-like folds leading to the hypothesis that TRIM16 acts as an ubiquitin ligase. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that TRIM16, devoid of a classical RING domain had auto-polyubiquitination activity and acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro assays. Thus via its unique structure, TRIM16 possesses both heterodimerization function with other TRIM proteins and also has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.","['Bell, Jessica L', 'Malyukova, Alena', 'Holien, Jessica K', 'Koach, Jessica', 'Parker, Michael W', 'Kavallaris, Maria', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Cheung, Belamy B']","['Bell JL', 'Malyukova A', 'Holien JK', 'Koach J', 'Parker MW', 'Kavallaris M', 'Marshall GM', 'Cheung BB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3357404,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0037470 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-18038 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37470. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037470.

The tumor microenvironment is increasingly being recognized as a critical factor in mediating cancer cell survival and drug resistance. In this study, we propose to identify mechanisms involved in the chemoprotection conferred by the BM stroma to leukemia cells. METHODS: Using a leukemia mouse model and a human leukemia cell line, we studied the interaction of leukemia cells with the BM microenvironment. We evaluated in vivo and in vitro leukemia cell chemoprotection to different cytotoxic agents mediated by the BM stroma. Leukemia cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and western blotting. The activity of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), responsible for cytarabine cell incorporation, was investigated by measuring transport and intracellular accumulation of (3)H-adenosine. RESULTS: Leukemia cell mobilization from the bone marrow into peripheral blood in vivo using a CXCR4 inhibitor induced chemo-sensitization of leukemia cells to cytarabine, which translated into a prolonged survival advantage in our mouse leukemia model. In vitro, the BM stromal cells secreted a soluble factor that mediated significant chemoprotection to leukemia cells from cytarabine induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the BM stromal cell supernatant induced a 50% reduction of the ENT1 activity in leukemia cells, reducing the incorporation of cytarabine. No protection was observed when radiation or other cytotoxic agents such as etoposide, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil were used. CONCLUSION: The BM stroma secretes a soluble factor that significantly protects leukemia cells from cytarabine-induced apoptosis and blocks ENT1 activity. Strategies that modify the chemo-protective effects mediated by the BM microenvironment may enhance the benefit of conventional chemotherapy for patients with AML.","['Macanas-Pirard, Patricia', 'Leisewitz, Andrea', 'Broekhuizen, Richard', 'Cautivo, Kelly', 'Barriga, Francisco M', 'Leisewitz, Francisco', 'Gidi, Victoria', 'Riquelme, Erick', 'Montecinos, Viviana P', 'Swett, Pilar', 'Besa, Pelayo', 'Ramirez, Pablo', 'Ocqueteau, Mauricio', 'Kalergis, Alexis M', 'Holt, Matthew', 'Rettig, Michael', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Nervi, Bruno']","['Macanas-Pirard P', 'Leisewitz A', 'Broekhuizen R', 'Cautivo K', 'Barriga FM', 'Leisewitz F', 'Gidi V', 'Riquelme E', 'Montecinos VP', 'Swett P', 'Besa P', 'Ramirez P', 'Ocqueteau M', 'Kalergis AM', 'Holt M', 'Rettig M', 'DiPersio JF', 'Nervi B']","['Departamento de Hematologia y Oncologia, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3358339,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0037203 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-23265 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37203. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037203.

We generated genome-wide replication-timing profiles for pediatric leukemias from 17 patients and three cell lines, as well as normal B and T cells. Nonleukemic EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines displayed highly stable replication-timing profiles that were more similar to normal T cells than to leukemias. Leukemias were more similar to each other than to B and T cells but were considerably more heterogeneous than nonleukemic controls. Some differences were patient specific, while others were found in all leukemic samples, potentially representing early epigenetic events. Differences encompassed large segments of chromosomes and included genes implicated in other types of cancer. Remarkably, differences that distinguished leukemias aligned in register to the boundaries of developmentally regulated replication-timing domains that distinguish normal cell types. Most changes did not coincide with copy-number variation or translocations. However, many of the changes that were associated with translocations in some leukemias were also shared between all leukemic samples independent of the genetic lesion, suggesting that they precede and possibly predispose chromosomes to the translocation. Altogether, our results identify sites of abnormal developmental control of DNA replication in cancer that reveal the significance of replication-timing boundaries to chromosome structure and function and support the replication domain model of replication-timing regulation. They also open new avenues of investigation into the chromosomal basis of cancer and provide a potential novel source of epigenetic cancer biomarkers.","['Ryba, Tyrone', 'Battaglia, Dana', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Shirley, James W', 'Buckley, Quinton', 'Pope, Benjamin D', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Gilbert, David M']","['Ryba T', 'Battaglia D', 'Chang BH', 'Shirley JW', 'Buckley Q', 'Pope BD', 'Devidas M', 'Druker BJ', 'Gilbert DM']","['Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306, USA.']",['eng'],"['1K12HD057588-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'GM06999/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM085354/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM085354/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000064/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD057588/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,PMC3460179,2012/05/26 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.138511.112 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.138511.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2012 Oct;22(10):1833-44. doi: 10.1101/gr.138511.112.

PROCEDURE: Self-reported height/weight, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy/live birth were determined among acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia survivors (n = 3,467) participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, an ongoing cohort study of 5-year survivors of pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986. RESULTS: Compared with no radiotherapy, risk estimates were consistent across outcomes (adult short stature, hypothyroidism, absence of pregnancy/live birth) with CRT treatment associated with 2-3-fold increased risks, TBI associated with 5-10 fold increased risks, and CRT + TBI associated with >10 fold increased risks. Exposure to any SRT further increased risk of these outcomes 2-3-fold. Changes in body composition were more nuanced as CRT only was associated with an increased risk of being overweight/obese (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9) whereas TBI only was associated with an increased risk of being underweight (OR 6.0, 95% CI 2.4-14.9). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients treated with CRT + TBI were at greatest risk for short stature, hypothyroidism, and a reduced likelihood of pregnancy/live birth, those treated with either modality alone had significantly increased risks as well, including altered body composition. Any SRT exposure further increased risk in an independent fashion.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Liu, Wei', 'Srivastava, Kumar', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Hayashi, Robert J', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Baker, K Scott']","['Chow EJ', 'Liu W', 'Srivastava K', 'Leisenring WM', 'Hayashi RJ', 'Sklar CA', 'Stovall M', 'Robison LL', 'Baker KS']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu""]",['eng'],"['K07 CA151775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC3436954,2012/05/26 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24198 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Jan;60(1):110-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24198.

Previous studies have demonstrated that CREB is a proto-oncogene whose overexpression promotes cellular proliferation in hematopoietic cells. Transgenic mice that overexpress CREB in myeloid cells develop a myeloproliferative disease with splenomegaly and aberrant myelopoiesis. However, CREB overexpressing mice do not spontaneously develop acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis to identify genes that accelerate leukemia in CREB transgenic mice. Our mutagenesis screen identified several integration sites, including oncogenes Gfi1, Myb, and Ras. The Sox4 transcription factor was identified by our screen as a gene that cooperates with CREB in myeloid leukemogenesis. We show that the transduction of CREB transgenic mouse bone marrow cells with a Sox4 retrovirus increases survival and self-renewal of cells in vitro. Furthermore, leukemic blasts from the majority of acute myeloid leukemia patients have higher CREB, phosphorylated CREB, and Sox 4 protein expression. Sox4 transduction of mouse bone marrow cells results in increased expression of CREB target genes. We also demonstrate that CREB is a direct target of Sox4 by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These results indicate that Sox4 and CREB cooperate and contribute to increased proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Sandoval, Salemiz', 'Kraus, Christina', 'Cho, Er-Chieh', 'Cho, Michelle', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Manara, Elena', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Landaw, Elliot M', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Sandoval S', 'Kraus C', 'Cho EC', 'Cho M', 'Bies J', 'Manara E', 'Accordi B', 'Landaw EM', 'Wolff L', 'Pigazzi M', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Department of Pediatrics and Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Gwynne Hazen, Cherry Memorial Laboratories, Mattel Children's Hospital, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 HL075826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL75826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL83077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120524,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3390953,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47581-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-357418 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 5;120(1):155-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-357418.

Prior studies have shown that EP stimulates megakaryopoiesis in BM cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and the results also suggested that it may inhibit leukemia cell growth. In the present study, we studied the effects of EP on leukemia cell proliferation and the mechanism of its antiproliferative effects. We found that EP leads to a decreased cell division rate, a block in G(1) phase of cell cycle, and increased differentiation in human and murine leukemia cells. Because EP is species specific in that it can only bind TPO-R in human and primate cells, these findings further suggested that the antileukemic effect is independent of TPO-R. We found that treatment with EP leads to a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner. Experimental increase of intracellular iron abrogated the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects of EP, demonstrating that its antileukemic effects are mediated through modulation of intracellular iron content. Finally, determination of EP's antileukemic activity in vivo demonstrated its ability to prolong survival in 2 mouse models of leukemia.","['Roth, Michael', 'Will, Britta', 'Simkin, Guillermo', 'Narayanagari, Swathi', 'Barreyro, Laura', 'Bartholdy, Boris', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Mitsiades, Constantine S', 'Verma, Amit', 'Steidl, Ulrich']","['Roth M', 'Will B', 'Simkin G', 'Narayanagari S', 'Barreyro L', 'Bartholdy B', 'Tamari R', 'Mitsiades CS', 'Verma A', 'Steidl U']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, 1300 Morris Park Ave, Bronx, NY 10461, USa.""]",['eng'],"['R00 CA131503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00CA131503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3398759,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47546-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-399667 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 12;120(2):386-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-399667.

However, the existing ""baby machine"" is only suitable for cells which can be chemically attached to a surface. Here, we present a microfluidic ""baby machine"" in which cells are held onto a surface by pressure differences rather than chemical attachment.

Recently, we showed that IKK2 (also called IKKbeta), a catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, induces immunoglobulin E-mediated degranulation in mast cells by phosphorylating SNAP-23, the target-membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE). In addition to IKK2, a recent study has shown that ELKS, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, also induces the degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells. These findings indicate that the two subunits of the IKK complex, IKK2 and ELKS, function not only in NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation but also in NF-kappaB-independent pathways. This review focuses on the functions of IKK2 and ELKS in mast cell degranulation.","['Nakagomi, Daiki', 'Suzuki, Kotaro', 'Nakajima, Hiroshi']","['Nakagomi D', 'Suzuki K', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120515,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,,2012/06/01 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['000337800 [pii]', '10.1159/000337800 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2012;158 Suppl 1:92-5. doi: 10.1159/000337800.

Therefore, outcome prediction to chemotherapy at diagnosis is believed to be a critical consideration. METHODS: The mRNA expression of 12 genes closely involved in the actions of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline was evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), in 54 diagnostic bone marrow specimens of M2-subtype AML. RESULTS: Low expression levels of ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) and high expression levels of topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2B) were correlated with longer survival in a univariate analysis. Another interesting finding is that high ratios of TOP2B/RRM2 and TOP2B/TOP2 alpha (TOP2A) in a combined analysis were also shown to have a prognostic impact for longer survival with improved accuracy. Among the four markers, when adjusted for the influence of other clinical factors in multivariate analysis, the TOP2B/TOP2A ratio was significantly correlated with treatment outcomes; patients with high ratios trended toward longer disease-free survival (HR, 0.24; P=0.002) and overall survival (HR, 0.29; P=0.005). CONCLUSION: Genes with distinct expression profiles such as TOP2B/TOP2A expression ratio at diagnosis can be employed for outcome prediction after the treatment with standard regimens in AML patients with M2 subtype.","['Song, J H', 'Kweon, S H', 'Kim, H-J', 'Lee, T-H', 'Min, W-S', 'Kim, H-J', 'Kim, Y-K', 'Hwang, S Y', 'Kim, T S']","['Song JH', 'Kweon SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee TH', 'Min WS', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Hwang SY', 'Kim TS']","['Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC3389410,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012206 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Jun 26;107(1):108-15. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.206.

The duration from the start of carbapenem administration to decline of fever was not significantly different between the MEPM and DRPM groups (median, 3 versus 4 days; P = 0.79).

However, development of these neurons is poorly understood. We recently showed that molecular regulation of differentiation of the GABAergic neurons associated with the dopaminergic nuclei in the ventral midbrain (VTA and SNpr) is distinct from the rest of midbrain, but the reason for this difference remained elusive. Here, we have analyzed the developmental origin of the VTA and SNpr GABAergic neurons by genetic fate mapping. We demonstrate that the majority of these GABAergic neurons originate outside the midbrain, from rhombomere 1, and move into the ventral midbrain only as postmitotic neuronal precursors. We further show that Gata2, Gata3 and Tal1 define a subpopulation of GABAergic precursors in ventral rhombomere 1. A failure in GABAergic neuron differentiation in this region correlates with loss of VTA and SNpr GABAergic neurons in Tal1 mutant mice. In contrast to midbrain, GABAergic neurons of the anterior SNpr in the diencephalon are not derived from the rhombomere 1. These results suggest unique migratory pathways for the precursors of important GABAergic neuron subpopulations, and provide the basis for understanding diversity within midbrain GABAergic neurons.","['Achim, Kaia', 'Peltopuro, Paula', 'Lahti, Laura', 'Li, James', 'Salminen, Marjo', 'Partanen, Juha']","['Achim K', 'Peltopuro P', 'Lahti L', 'Li J', 'Salminen M', 'Partanen J']","['Department of Biosciences, PO Box 56, Viikinkaari 5, FIN00014-University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.076380 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.076380 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2012 Jul;139(13):2360-70. doi: 10.1242/dev.076380.

Targeting XIAP has proven effective for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and restoration of cancer cell chemosensitivity. Arsenic (or sodium arsenite) is a potent anti-tumor agent used to treat patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Additionally, arsenic induces cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human HCC cells. In this study, we identified XIAP as a target for sodium arsenite-induced cytotoxicity in HCC. The exposure of HCC cell lines to sodium arsenite resulted in inhibition of XIAP expression in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. Sodium arsenite blocked the de novo XIAP synthesis and the activity of its internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element. Moreover, treatment with sodium arsenite decreased the protein stability of XIAP and induced its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of XIAP attenuated the pro-apoptotic effect of sodium arsenite in HCC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that sodium arsenite suppresses XIAP expression via translational and post-translational mechanisms in HCC.","['Chen, Hong', 'Hao, Yuqing', 'Wang, Lijing', 'Jia, Dongwei', 'Ruan, Yuanyuan', 'Gu, Jianxin']","['Chen H', 'Hao Y', 'Wang L', 'Jia D', 'Ruan Y', 'Gu J']","['Gene Research Center, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)00943-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.066 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jun 15;422(4):721-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.066.

However, the role of minimal residual disease testing has not been widely adopted in multiple myeloma (MM), with other parameters such as the International Staging System (ISS) and cytogenetic analysis primarily guiding therapy and determination of prognosis. Until recently, achieving a complete response (CR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, was rare in patients with MM. The use of novel agents with or without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) has significantly increased CR rates, thus increasing overall survival (OS) rates. The majority of patients with MM have persistent levels of residual disease that are below the sensitivity of bone marrow (BM) morphology, protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, and light chain quantitation even after attaining CR and will eventually relapse. Measurement of minimal residual disease by more sensitive methods, and the use of these methods as a tool for predicting patient outcomes and guiding therapeutic decisions, has thus become more relevant. Methods available for monitoring minimal residual disease in MM include PCR and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), both of which have been shown to be valuable in other hematologic malignancies; however, neither has become a standard of care in MM. Here, we review current evidence for using minimal residual disease measurement for risk assessment in MM as well as incorporating pretreatment factors and posttreatment minimal residual disease monitoring as a prognostic tool for therapeutic decisions, and we outline challenges to developing uniform criteria for minimal residual disease monitoring.","['Hart, Andrew J', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Kim, Annette S', 'Mosse, Claudio A', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Kassim, Adetola']","['Hart AJ', 'Jagasia MH', 'Kim AS', 'Mosse CA', 'Savani BN', 'Kassim A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Section of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120522,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2012/05/26 06:00,2013/07/10 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00211-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Dec;18(12):1790-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.05.009.

Clinically significant bacterial transmission from HCT products is rare. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old male of Asian descent with chronic myelogenous leukemia developed sepsis leading to acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation during infusion of matched unrelated donor bone marrow. This product later tested positive for Bacillus cereus. DISCUSSION: This HCT product traveled 31 hours at room temperature before arriving at the transplant center. Reducing transport times, transporting at 4 degrees C, and enhancing bacterial surveillance of HCT products may increase the ability to detect bacterial proliferation from transport. CONCLUSION: To prevent a similar case in the future, we will begin Gram staining all HCT products in transit more than 24 hours to alert physicians of the need for prophylactic antibiotic therapy.","['Kelley, James M', 'Onderdonk, Andrew B', 'Kao, Grace']","['Kelley JM', 'Onderdonk AB', 'Kao G']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120525,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,2012/05/26 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03723.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 Feb;53(2):394-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03723.x.

As yet, no population-based incidence estimates of SCN have been reported. Children less than 16 years of age with SCN were sought in Sweden during the 20-year period 1987-2006 by a questionnaire to all Swedish Departments of Paediatrics and by reviewing the Swedish Health and Welfare Statistical Databases. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with congenital neutropenia during this period. All received treatment with recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Twenty-one patients were diagnosed as SCN or probable SCN, corresponding to 1.0 per 100,000 live births. Nine (43%) had ELANE mutations, four (19%) HAX1 mutations and eight (38%) were children with disease of unknown genetic aetiology. Four out of 21 patients (19%) developed myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia and three (14%) died, all with leukaemia. The cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia was 31%. The observed incidence of SCN in this population-based study was higher than previously estimated, possibly because genetic testing now can identify SCN cases previously thought to be idiopathic or benign neutropenia. The risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia is considerable. ELANE mutations are the most commonly identified genetic defects.","['Carlsson, Goran', 'Fasth, Anders', 'Berglof, Elisabet', 'Lagerstedt-Robinson, Kristina', 'Nordenskjold, Magnus', 'Palmblad, Jan', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Fadeel, Bengt']","['Carlsson G', 'Fasth A', 'Berglof E', 'Lagerstedt-Robinson K', 'Nordenskjold M', 'Palmblad J', 'Henter JI', 'Fadeel B']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. goran.carlsson@ki.se""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120525,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/05/26 06:00,2012/10/24 06:00,['2012/05/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09171.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Aug;158(3):363-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09171.x.

Cks1 expression is elevated in various B cell malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma. We have previously shown that loss of Cks1 results in elevated p27(Kip1) levels and delayed tumor development in a mouse model of Myc-induced B cell lymphoma. Surprisingly, loss of Skp2 in the same mouse model also resulted in elevated p27(Kip1) levels but exhibited no impact on tumor onset. This raises the possibility that Cks1 could have other oncogenic activities than suppressing p27(Kip1). To challenge this notion we have targeted overexpression of Cks1 to B cells using a conditional retroviral bone marrow transduction-transplantation system. Despite potent ectopic overexpression, Cks1 was unable to promote B cell hyperproliferation or B cell malignancies, indicating that Cks1 is not oncogenic when overexpressed in B cells. Since Skp2 overexpression can drive T-cell tumorigenesis or other cancers we also widened the quest for oncogenic activity of Cks1 by ubiquitously expressing Cks1 in hematopoetic progenitors. At variance with c-Myc overexpression, which caused acute myeloid leukemia, Cks1 overexpression did not induce myeloproliferation or leukemia. Therefore, despite being associated with a poor prognosis in various malignancies, sole Cks1 expression is insufficient to induce lymphoma or a myeloproliferative disease in vivo.","['Kratzat, Susanne', 'Nikolova, Viktoriya', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Hoellein, Alexander', 'Schoeffmann, Stephanie', 'Gorka, Oliver', 'Pietschmann, Elke', 'Illert, Anna-Lena', 'Ruland, Jurgen', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Nilsson, Jonas', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Keller, Ulrich']","['Kratzat S', 'Nikolova V', 'Miething C', 'Hoellein A', 'Schoeffmann S', 'Gorka O', 'Pietschmann E', 'Illert AL', 'Ruland J', 'Peschel C', 'Nilsson J', 'Duyster J', 'Keller U']","['III.

The antisense strand of the HTLV-1 genome encodes HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) protein (HBZ), a protein that inhibits Tax-mediated viral transcription, enhances T-cell proliferation, and promotes viral persistence. Recently, an HTLV-2 antisense viral protein (APH-2) was identified. Despite its lack of a typical b-ZIP domain, APH-2, like HBZ, interacts with cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and downregulates Tax-mediated viral transcription. Here, we provide evidence that the APH-2 C-terminal LXXLL motif is important for CREB binding and Tax repression. In order to investigate the functional role of APH-2 in the HTLV-2-mediated immortalization of primary T lymphocytes in vitro and in HTLV-2 infection in vivo, we generated APH-2 mutant viruses. In cell cultures, the immortalization capacities of APH-2 mutant viruses were indistinguishable from that of wild-type HTLV-2 (wtHTLV-2), indicating that, like HBZ, APH-2 is dispensable for viral infection and cellular transformation. In vivo, rabbits inoculated with either wtHTLV-2 or APH-2 mutant viruses established a persistent infection. However, the APH-2 knockout virus displayed an increased replication rate, as measured by an increased viral antibody response and a higher proviral load. In contrast to HTLV-1 HBZ, we show that APH-2 is dispensable for the establishment of an efficient infection and persistence in a rabbit animal model. Therefore, antisense proteins of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 have evolved different functions in vivo, and further comparative studies will provide fundamental insights into the distinct pathobiologies of these two viruses.","['Yin, Han', 'Kannian, Priya', 'Dissinger, Nathan', 'Haines, Robyn', 'Niewiesk, Stefan', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Yin H', 'Kannian P', 'Dissinger N', 'Haines R', 'Niewiesk S', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI095913/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI095913/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120523,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3421770,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00717-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00717-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Aug;86(16):8412-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00717-12.

We hypothesized that high-resolution genomic analysis of CLL would identify additional recurrent abnormalities associated with short time-to-first therapy (TTFT). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We undertook high-resolution genomic analysis of 161 prospectively enrolled CLLs using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays, and integrated analysis of this data set with gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Copy number analysis (CNA) of nonprogressive CLL reveals a stable genotype, with a median of only 1 somatic CNA per sample. Progressive CLL with 13q deletion was associated with additional somatic CNAs, and a greater number of CNAs was predictive of TTFT. We identified other recurrent CNAs associated with short TTFT: 8q24 amplification focused on the cancer susceptibility locus near MYC in 3.7%; 3q26 amplifications focused on PIK3CA in 5.6%; and 8p deletions in 5% of patients. Sequencing of MYC further identified somatic mutations in two CLLs. We determined which catalytic subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) were in active complex with the p85 regulatory subunit and showed enrichment for the alpha subunit in three CLLs carrying PIK3CA amplification. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate amplifications of 3q26 focused on PIK3CA and 8q24 focused on MYC in CLL.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Hanna, Megan', 'Tesar, Bethany', 'Werner, Lillian', 'Pochet, Nathalie', 'Asara, John M', 'Wang, Yaoyu E', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Thompson, Christina', 'Macconaill, Laura', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Van de Peer, Yves', 'Correll, Mick', 'Regev, Aviv', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Freedman, Arnold S']","['Brown JR', 'Hanna M', 'Tesar B', 'Werner L', 'Pochet N', 'Asara JM', 'Wang YE', 'Dal Cin P', 'Fernandes SM', 'Thompson C', 'Macconaill L', 'Wu CJ', 'Van de Peer Y', 'Correll M', 'Regev A', 'Neuberg D', 'Freedman AS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.

Six members of the MLL family exist in humans, including SETD1A, SETD1B and MLL1-MLL4. Each of them plays non-redundant roles in development and disease genesis. MLL1 regulates the cell cycle and the oscillation of circadian gene expression. Its fusion proteins are involved in leukemogenesis. Here, we studied the role of MLL1 in innate immunity and found it selectively regulates the activation of genes downstream of NF-kappaB mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Real-time PCR and genome-wide gene expression profile analysis proved that the deficiency of MLL1 reduced the expression of a group of genes downstream of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). However, the activation of NF-kappaB itself was not affected. The MLL1 complex is found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and is associated with NF-kappaB.

In the present study, we evaluated T-cell responses of 56 healthy donors to in vitro sensitization with autologous APCs loaded with a pool of overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the sequence of WT-1. Thereafter, we mapped the WT-1 peptides eliciting responses in each individual, defined the immunogenic peptides, and identified their presenting HLA alleles. We report 41 previously unreported epitopes of WT-1: 5 presented by class II and 36 by class I alleles, including 10 that could be presented by more than 1 class I allele. IFNgamma(+) T cells responding to 98% of the class I and 60% of the class II epitopes exhibited HLA-restricted cytotoxicity against peptide-loaded targets. T cells specific for 36 WT-1 peptides were evaluable for leukemocidal activity, of which 27 (75%) lysed WT-1(+) leukemic targets sharing their restricting HLA allele. Each epitope identified induced T-cell responses in most donors sharing the epitopes' presenting allele; these responses often exceeded responses to flanking peptides predicted to be more immunogenic.

Currently, no effective and specific Taspase1 inhibitors are available, precluding its therapeutic exploitation. As the Taspase1 proenzyme is autoproteolytically cleaved and assumed to assemble into an active alphabetabetaalpha heterodimer, we attempted to interfere with its activity by targeting Taspase1's dimerization. Notably, enforced expression of inactive Taspase1 mutants, aiming to inhibit formation of active protease dimers, was not inhibitory. Immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, and in vivo protein interaction assays revealed that active Taspase1 exists predominantly as an alphabeta monomer in living cells, providing an explanation why overexpression of inactive mutants was not trans-dominant. To alternatively test the biological consequences of enforced dimerization, we engineered Taspase1 variants containing the Jun/Fos dimerization motif. In absence of the respective interaction partners, the protease fusions were fully active, while enforcing dimerization by coexpression significantly inhibited processing of several target proteins in living cells. Our study provides the first evidence that Taspase1 is already active as an alphabeta monomer, arguing against heterocomplex formation being required for its pathobiological activity. Thus, it clearly supports strategies aiming to inhibit the cancer-promoting activity of Taspase1 by the identification of chemical decoys enforcing its dimerization.","['Bier, Carolin', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Wunsch, Desiree', 'Kunst, Lena', 'Scheiding, Sabine', 'Kaiser, Markus', 'Ottmann, Christian', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Stauber, Roland H']","['Bier C', 'Knauer SK', 'Wunsch D', 'Kunst L', 'Scheiding S', 'Kaiser M', 'Ottmann C', 'Kramer OH', 'Stauber RH']","['Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Mainz Screening Center, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.11-202432 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.11-202432 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2012 Aug;26(8):3421-9. doi: 10.1096/fj.11-202432.

Mutations at this junction have been shown to destabilize genome dimerization, with concomitant reductions in viral packaging efficiency and infectivity. Optical tweezers experiments have shown that it requires as much force to break the MMLV kissing-loop complex as is required to unfold an 11-bp RNA hairpin [Li PTX, Bustamante C, Tinoco I (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:15847-15852]. Using nonequilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we have developed a detailed model for the kinetic intermediates of the force-induced dissociation of the MMLV dimerization initiation site kissing loop. Two hundred and eight dissociation events were simulated (approximately 16 mus total simulation time) under conditions of constant applied external force, which we use to construct a Markov state model for kissing-loop dissociation. We find that the complex undergoes a conformational rearrangement, which allows for equal distribution of the applied force among all of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which is intrinsically more stable than the sequential unzipping of an ordinary hairpin. Stacking interactions with adjacent, unpaired loop adenines further stabilize the complex by increasing the repair rate of partially broken H-bonds. These stacking interactions are prominently featured in the transition state, which requires additional coordinates orthogonal to the end-to-end extension to be uniquely identified. We propose that these stabilizing features explain the unusual stability of other retroviral kissing-loop complexes such as the HIV dimerization site.","['Chen, Alan A', 'Garcia, Angel E']","['Chen AA', 'Garcia AE']","['Department of Physics and Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, Troy, NY 12180, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 GM091774/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32GM091774/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120523,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3386141,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1119552109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1119552109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jun 12;109(24):E1530-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119552109.

We recently demonstrated that the AHI-1 oncogene physically interacts with BCR-ABL and JAK2 and mediates cellular resistance to TKI in CML stem/progenitor cells. We now show that deletion of the SH3 domain of AHI-1 significantly enhances apoptotic response of BCR-ABL(+) cells to TKIs compared to cells expressing full-length AHI-1. We have also discovered a novel interaction between AHI-1 and Dynamin-2, a GTPase, through the AHI-1 SH3 domain. The crystal structure of the AHI-1 SH3 domain at 1.53-A resolution reveals that it adopts canonical SH3 folding, with the exception of an unusual C-terminal alpha helix. PD1R peptide, known to interact with the PI3K SH3 domain, was used to model the binding pattern between the AHI-1 SH3 domain and its ligands. These studies showed that an ""Arg-Arg-Trp"" stack may form within the binding interface, providing a potential target site for designing specific drugs. The crystal structure of the AHI-1 SH3 domain thus provides a valuable tool for identification of key interaction sites in regulation of drug resistance and for the development of small molecule inhibitors for CML.","['Liu, Xiaohu', 'Chen, Min', 'Lobo, Paolo', 'An, Jianghong', 'Grace Cheng, S W', 'Moradian, Annie', 'Morin, Gregg B', 'Van Petegem, Filip', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Liu X', 'Chen M', 'Lobo P', 'An J', 'Grace Cheng SW', 'Moradian A', 'Morin GB', 'Van Petegem F', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.201100553 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2012 Jul;12(13):2094-106. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201100553.,20121129,10.1002/pmic.201100553 [doi],,,"['0 (AHI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamin II)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Dynamin II/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', '*src Homology Domains']",,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the national inpatient sample from 2000 to 2008. Immediate treatment was defined as treatment in hospital day 0 or 1. Delay in treatment was defined as treatment in hospital day 2 and beyond. RESULTS: During the study period, 683,016 pediatric appendicitis were identified. 17,737 (2.6%) experienced a delay in treatment. Multivariate analysis identified associated co-morbidities for delay in treatment: ALL (OR 12.84, CI 11.04-14.94), AML (OR 9.41, CI 7.58-11.68), neutropenia (OR 5.53, CI 4.60-6.65), and ovarian cyst without torsion (OR 3.17, CI 2.94-3.42). Surgical management included more than 13-fold increase in drainage procedures (5.5 vs. 0.4%), sixfold increase in cecectomy (1.2 vs. 0.2%), 14-fold increase in hemicolectomy (1.4 vs. 0.1%), 11-fold increase in small bowel laceration suture repair (1.1 vs. 0.1%), and 15-fold increase in small bowel resection (1.5 vs. 0.1%). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital delay beyond 2 days is associated with significant negative outcomes with regard to complications, economic burden, and subsequent surgical management. Using the co-morbidity index, high-risk co-morbidities with associated delay in treatment were identified.","['Lee, Justin', 'Tashjian, David B', 'Moriarty, Kevin P']","['Lee J', 'Tashjian DB', 'Moriarty KP']","[""Baystate Children's Hospital, Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA 01199, USA.

We investigated the role of mTORC1 in mouse hematopoiesis using a mouse model of conditional deletion of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1. Raptor deficiency impaired granulocyte and B cell development but did not alter survival or proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Raptor deficiency significantly suppressed leukemia progression by causing apoptosis of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, leukemia cells. mTORC1 did not control cell cycle or cell growth in undifferentiated AML cells in vivo. Transplantation of Raptor-deficient undifferentiated AML cells in a limiting dilution revealed that mTORC1 is essential for leukemia initiation. Strikingly, a subset of AML cells with undifferentiated phenotypes survived long-term in the absence of mTORC1 activity. We further demonstrated that the reactivation of mTORC1 in those cells restored their leukemia-initiating capacity. Thus, AML cells lacking mTORC1 activity can self-renew as AML stem cells.

Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are frequently disarmed in relapsed and refractory cancer through genetic deletion or interaction-based neutralization by overexpressed antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatments. New pharmacologic strategies are urgently needed to overcome these formidable apoptotic blockades. We harnessed the natural killing activity of BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM), which contains one of the most potent BH3 death domains of the BCL-2 protein family, to restore BH3-dependent cell death in resistant hematologic cancers. A hydrocarbon-stapled peptide modeled after the BIM BH3 helix broadly targeted BCL-2 family proteins with high affinity, blocked inhibitory antiapoptotic interactions, directly triggered proapoptotic activity, and induced dose-responsive and BH3 sequence-specific cell death of hematologic cancer cells. The therapeutic potential of stapled BIM BH3 was highlighted by the selective activation of cell death in the aberrant lymphoid infiltrates of mice reconstituted with BIM-deficient bone marrow and in a human AML xenograft model. Thus, we found that broad and multimodal targeting of the BCL-2 family pathway can overcome pathologic barriers to cell death.","['LaBelle, James L', 'Katz, Samuel G', 'Bird, Gregory H', 'Gavathiotis, Evripidis', 'Stewart, Michelle L', 'Lawrence, Chelsea', 'Fisher, Jill K', 'Godes, Marina', 'Pitter, Kenneth', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Walensky, Loren D']","['LaBelle JL', 'Katz SG', 'Bird GH', 'Gavathiotis E', 'Stewart ML', 'Lawrence C', 'Fisher JK', 'Godes M', 'Pitter K', 'Kung AL', 'Walensky LD']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and 2Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['R00 HL095929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA92625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA092625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA151450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL103847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA050239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA151450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120524,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC3366394,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['46231 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI46231 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Jun;122(6):2018-31. doi: 10.1172/JCI46231.

At first, the GS-LDHs were used for the immunosensor platform for improving the electronic transmission rate as well as increasing the surface area to capture a large amount of primary antibodies (Ab(1)). After that, ferrocene (Fc), secondary antibodies (Ab(2)) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) multifunctional LDHs@Fe(3)O(4) nanospheres were used as labels with high load amount and good biological activity. Subsequently, in presence of H(2)O(2), amplified signals were obtained by an electrochemical sandwich immunoassay protocol. To embody the signal amplification property of the protocol, the analytical properties of various immunosensor platform and labels were compared in detail. Under optimal conditions, the reduction peak currents of the electrochemical immunosensor were proportional to the ALVs-J concentration over the range from 10(2.32) to 10(5.50) TCID(50)/mL with a low detection limit (180 TCID(50)/mL, S/N=3).

Often the toxicities of chemotherapeutics are due to the induction of significant DNA damage that is necessary for their ability to kill cancer cells. In some clinical situations, the direct induction of significant cytotoxicity is not a requirement to meet clinical goals. For example, differentiation, growth arrest, and/or senescence is a valuable outcome in some cases. In fact, in the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the use of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has revolutionized the therapy for a subset of leukemia patients and led to a dramatic survival improvement. Remarkably, this therapeutic approach is possible even in many elderly patients, who would not be able to tolerate therapy with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Because of the success of ATRA, there is widespread interest in identifying differentiation strategies that may be effective for the 90-95% of AML patients who do not clinically respond to ATRA. Utilizing an AML differentiation agent that is in development, we found that AML differentiation can be induced through ATP depletion and the subsequent activation of DNA damage signaling through an ATR/Chk1-dependent and p53-independent pathway. This study not only reveals mechanisms of AML differentiation but also suggests that further investigation is warranted to investigate the potential clinical use of low dose chemotherapeutics to induce differentiation instead of cytotoxicity. This therapeutic approach may be of particular benefit to patients, such as elderly AML patients, who often cannot tolerate traditional AML chemotherapy.","['Chakrabarti, Amitabha', 'Gupta, Kalpana', 'Sharma, James Prabhakar', 'Yang, Jinbo', 'Agarwal, Anju', 'Glick, Abigail', 'Zhang, Youwei', 'Agarwal, Munna', 'Agarwal, Mukesh K', 'Wald, David N']","['Chakrabarti A', 'Gupta K', 'Sharma JP', 'Yang J', 'Agarwal A', 'Glick A', 'Zhang Y', 'Agarwal M', 'Agarwal MK', 'Wald DN']","['Invenio Therapeutics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['R00 CA126173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20120523,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3390638,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43371-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.312801 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jul 6;287(28):23635-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.312801.

However, there is no report concerning the role of Tim-3 in diseases of domestic animals. In this study, cDNA encoding for bovine Tim-3 and Gal-9 were cloned and sequenced, and their expression and role in immune reactivation were analyzed in bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected cattle. Predicted amino acid sequences of Tim-3 and Gal-9 shared high homologies with human and mouse homologues. Functional domains, including tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif in the intracellular domain of Tim-3 were highly conserved among cattle and other species. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that bovine Tim-3 mRNA is mainly expressed in T cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ cells, while Gal-9 mRNA is mainly expressed in monocyte and T cells. Tim-3 mRNA expression in CD4+ and CD8+ cells was upregulated during disease progression of BLV infection. Interestingly, expression levels for Tim-3 and Gal-9 correlated positively with viral load in infected cattle. Furthermore, Tim-3 expression level closely correlated with up-regulation of IL-10 in infected cattle. The expression of IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA was upregulated when PBMC from BLV-infected cattle were cultured with Cos-7 cells expressing Tim-3 to inhibit the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway. Moreover, combined blockade of the Tim-3/Gal-9 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways significantly promoted IFN-gamma mRNA expression compared with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway alone. These results suggest that Tim-3 is involved in the suppression of T cell function during BLV infection.","['Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Suzuki, Saori', 'Shirai, Tatsuya', 'Sunden, Yuji', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Okagawa T', 'Konnai S', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Suzuki S', 'Shirai T', 'Sunden Y', 'Onuma M', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan. okazu@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,PMC3443419,2012/05/25 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1297-9716-43-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1297-9716-43-45 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Res. 2012 May 23;43:45. doi: 10.1186/1297-9716-43-45.,20140602,10.1186/1297-9716-43-45 [doi],,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Galectins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB689695', 'GENBANK/AB689696']",,,,,,,,,,

Benzene, an established leukemogen at high doses, has been suggested to induce hypomethylation based on investigations of DNA methylation in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive elements. Whether global genomic DNA methylation content is reduced in response to benzene exposure is still undetermined. METHODS: We measured global DNA methylation in 78 gasoline station attendants and 58 controls in peripheral blood cells using high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PCR-Pyrosequencing measures of DNA methylation at Alu and LINE-1 repetitive elements, representing a large proportion of methylation in non-coding regions, were also available. Exposure markers included personal airborne benzene, and urinary benzene, t,t-muconic acid (t,t-MA) and S-phelylmercapturic acid. RESULTS: Mean global DNA methylation was 5.474 (+/- 0.083) %5mC in controls and 5.409 (+/- 0.142) %5mC in exposed participants (p = 0.01). All methylation markers were negatively correlated with airborne benzene. Alu and LINE-1 methylation, but not global DNA methylation, were negatively associated with t,t-MA; no association with the other urinary biomarkers was found. Multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for gender and age confirmed the results of correlation analysis and showed a 1.6% decrease in global DNA methylation associated with being gasoline station attendants. Alu and LINE-1 methylation levels were not associated with global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Our results show that benzene exposure is associated with alterations in both global DNA and repetitive element methylation. Global and repetitive element methylation levels are not correlated in blood DNA, likely representing independent responses to benzene exposure.","['Fustinoni, Silvia', 'Rossella, Federica', 'Polledri, Elisa', 'Bollati, Valentina', 'Campo, Laura', 'Byun, Hyang-Min', 'Agnello, L', 'Consonni, D', 'Pesatori, Angela C', 'Baccarelli, A', 'Bertazzi, P A']","['Fustinoni S', 'Rossella F', 'Polledri E', 'Bollati V', 'Campo L', 'Byun HM', 'Agnello L', 'Consonni D', 'Pesatori AC', 'Baccarelli A', 'Bertazzi PA']","[""Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Milan and Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. silvia.fustinoni@unimi.it""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,2012/05/25 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/05/25 06:00'],"['2012/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 2012 Mar-Apr;103(2):84-95.,20120620,,,,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis', 'Benzene/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Biomarkers/blood/urine', 'Case-Control Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Genomics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/urine', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Male', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regression Analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Except for some kind of cancers, no effective and/or definitive therapeutic treatment aimed to reduce or to retard the clinic and pathologic symptoms induced by AD and PD is presently available. Therefore, it is urgently needed to understand the molecular basis of these disorders. Since oxidative stress (OS) is an important etiologic factor of the pathologic process of AD, PD, and cancer, understanding how intracellular signaling pathways respond to OS will have a significant implication in the therapy of these diseases. Here, we propose a model of minimal completeness of cell death signaling induced by OS as a mechanistic explanation of neuronal and cancer cell demise. This mechanism might provide the basis for therapeutic design strategies. Finally, we will attempt to associate PD, cancer, and OS.

This study investigated the efficiency of novel multifunctional Fe(3)O(4) magnetic nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)-MNP) combined with chemotherapy and hyperthermia for overcoming multidrug resistance in an in vivo model of leukemia. METHODS: Nude mice with tumor xenografts were randomly divided into a control group, and the treatment groups were allocated to receive daunorubicin, 5-bromotetrandrine (5-BrTet) and daunorubicin, Fe(3)O(4)-MNP, and Fe(3)O(4)-MNP coloaded with daunorubicin and 5-bromotetrandrine (Fe(3)O(4)-MNP-DNR-5-BrTet), with hyperthermia in an alternating magnetic field. We investigated tumor volume and pathology, as well as P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein expression to elucidate the effect of multimodal treatment on overcoming multidrug resistance. RESULTS: Fe(3)O(4)-MNP played a role in increasing tumor temperature during hyperthermia. Tumors became significantly smaller, and apoptosis of cells was observed in both the Fe(3)O(4)-MNP and Fe(3)O(4)-MNP-DNR-5-BrTet groups, especially in the Fe(3)O(4)-MNP-DNR-5-BrTet group, while tumor volumes in the other groups had increased after treatment for 12 days. Furthermore, Fe(3)O(4)-MNP-DNR-5-BrTet with hyperthermia noticeably decreased P-glycoprotein and Bcl-2 expression, and markedly increased Bax and caspase-3 expression.

Endometriotic lesions composed of endometrial stromal cells (ESC) and glandular epithelial cells (EEC) are thought to arise from menstrual endometrial tissue reaching the pelvic cavity via retrograde menstruation. The cause of endometriotic lesion formation is still not clear. Recent evidence suggest that cytokines may play a role in the early development of endometriosis lesions. Because cytokines and growth factors signal via the v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) kinase pathway, we have examined the role of Raf-1 in early steps of endometriosis lesion formation, specifically attachment of endometrial cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) and invasion of endometrial cells through PMC (trans-mesothelial invasion). Raf-1 antagonist GW5074 decreased attachment to PMC and trans-mesothelial invasion by primary EEC and ESC. Raf-1 also mediated TGFbeta-induced trans-mesothelial invasion by the established, low-invasive EEC line EM42. TGFbeta treatment of EEC resulted in Raf-1 phosphorylation at S338 and phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting that TGFbeta activates Raf-1 signaling in these cells. GW5074 had little effect on ESC proliferation but inhibited EEC growth significantly under reduced serum conditions. Antagonizing Raf-1 activity and expression via GW5074 and specific Raf-1 small interfering RNA, respectively, did not alter EEC resistance to growth inhibition by TGFbeta. Raf-1 inhibition blocked induction of EEC growth by epidermal growth factor. Our data suggest that Raf-1 may mediate pathologic steps involved in early endometriosis lesion formation and may be a mediator of TGFbeta and epidermal growth factor actions in endometriosis.","['De La Garza, Elizabeth M', 'Binkley, Peter A', 'Ganapathy, Manonmani', 'Krishnegowda, Naveen K', 'Tekmal, Rajeshwar R', 'Schenken, Robert S', 'Kirma, Nameer B']","['De La Garza EM', 'Binkley PA', 'Ganapathy M', 'Krishnegowda NK', 'Tekmal RR', 'Schenken RS', 'Kirma NB']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78229, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['en.2011-1879 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2011-1879 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2012 Aug;153(8):3911-21. doi: 10.1210/en.2011-1879.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterized by increased expression of several Hsp90 client proteins making it a potentially susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition. In this study we showed that the novel Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922-AG was cytotoxic to primary CLL cells in vitro (LD50=0.18muM+/-0.20). Importantly, its toxicity was preserved under cytoprotective co-culture conditions that rendered fludarabine ineffective. At the molecular level, NVP-AUY922-AG depleted the expression of multiple Hsp90 client proteins including Akt and activators of NF- kappaB, IKKalpha and IKKbeta. Consistent with this inhibition profile, NVP-AUY922-AG resulted in decreased transcription of the NF-B target genes MCL1, CFLAR, BIRC5. In contrast, fludarabine significantly induced the transcription of MCL1 and BIRC5. Given the anti-apoptotic nature of these genes and the role they play in fludarabine resistance, we considered that the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG with fludarabine might resensitize CLL cells to the effects of fludarabine. In keeping with this hypothesis, the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine was highly synergistic (mean CI=0.110.06) and this synergy was enhanced in co-culture (mean CI=0.06+/-0.08). Furthermore, the combination maintained the decrease in MCL1, CFLAR and BIRC5 transcription suggesting that the ability of NVP-AUY922-AG to modulate expression of these genes may contribute to the efficacy of this drug under cytoprotective co-culture conditions and for its remarkable synergy with fludarabine. Taken together these findings indicate that Hsp90 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy in CLL.","['Walsby, Elisabeth', 'Pearce, Lawrence', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Walsby E', 'Pearce L', 'Burnett AK', 'Fegan C', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Haematology, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK. walsbyej@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC3388182,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/10/13 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['491 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.491 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 May;3(5):525-34. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.491.,20121012,,,,"['0', '(5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropylphenyl)-4-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethylphenyl)isoxazole-3-', 'carboxylic acid ethylamide)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Resorcinols)', '0 (Survivin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Isoxazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Resorcinols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal abnormalities commonly found using conventional cytogenetics and FISH are del(11)(q22-23), trisomy 12, del(13)(q14), and del(17)(p13). Trisomy 12 is the most frequent numerical abnormality in CLL. It can appear isolated or associated with other chromosomal aberrations, including t(14;18)(q32;q21) and trisomy 18. The aim of this study was to determine whether CLL patients with isolated trisomy 12 or associated with other chromosomal alterations have different clinico-pathological features, including a different distribution NOTCH1 mutation. Patients were classified into four groups: Group 1, isolated trisomy 12 (n=14); Group 2, trisomy 12 plus trisomy 18 (n=4); Group 3, trisomy 12 plus t(14;18) (n=8); and Group 4: patients with trisomy 12 plus other abnormalities not involving BCL2 (n=28). The Binet stage and expression of ZAP70 were significantly different among cytogenetic groups.

Here, we report a rare case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), which occurred in an 18-year-old man who had undergone three liver transplants, initially for biliary atresia and subsequently for graft failure due to chronic rejection. He had received immunosuppression with cyclosporine and tacrolimus, as well as short-term treatment with OKT3. The T-ALL occurred 16 years after the first liver transplant. This case highlights the challenge for classifying rare neoplasms occurring in recipients of solid organ transplants that are currently not recognized to lie within the spectrum of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Given the long interval between the liver transplants and the development of T-ALL, a coincidental occurrence of the leukaemia cannot be ruled out. However, the potential roles of immunosuppressive therapy and other co-morbid conditions of the individual as possible risk factors for the pathogenesis of T-ALL are discussed.","['Fang, Yanan', 'Pinkney, Kerice A', 'Lee, John C', 'Gindin, Tatyana', 'Weiner, Michael A', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Bhagat, Govind']","['Fang Y', 'Pinkney KA', 'Lee JC', 'Gindin T', 'Weiner MA', 'Alobeid B', 'Bhagat G']","['Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11203, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120522,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,2012/05/24 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2016 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2013 Mar;31(1):49-53. doi: 10.1002/hon.2016.

In recent years, they have also emerged as important regulators of autophagy, a lysosomal-mediated pathway that contributes to degradation of a cell's own components. Imatinib, a targeted competitive inhibitor of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, has revolutionized the clinical treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We demonstrate that MIR30A-mediated autophagy enhances imatinib resistance against CML including primary stem and progenitor cells. MIR30A, but not MIR101, is a potent inhibitor of autophagy by selectively downregulating BECN1 and ATG5 expression in CML cells. MIR30A mimics, as well as knockdown of BECN1 and ATG5, increases intrinsic apoptotic pathways.

Recently, experimental studies have clearly demonstrated that this metalloid can also cure lymphoproliferative and/or pro-inflammatory syndromes in different murine models of chronic immune-mediated diseases. T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 lymphocytes play a central role in development of these diseases, in mice and humans, especially by secreting the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma and IL-17A, respectively. As(III) impairs basic functions of human T cells but its ability to modulate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by differentiated Th lymphocytes is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that As(III), used at concentrations clinically achievable in plasma of patients, has no effect on the secretion of interferon-gamma from Th1 cells but almost totally blocks the expression and the release of IL-17A from human Th17 lymphocytes co-stimulated for five days with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, in the presence of differentiating cytokines. In addition, As(III) specifically reduces mRNA levels of the retinoic-related orphan receptor (ROR)C gene which encodes RORgammat, a key transcription factor controlling optimal IL-17 expression in fully differentiated Th17 cells. The metalloid also blocks initial expression of IL-17 gene induced by the co-stimulation, probably in part by impairing activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that As(III) represses expression of the major pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A produced by human Th17 lymphocytes, thus strengthening the idea that As(III) may be useful to treat inflammatory immune-mediated diseases in humans.","['Morzadec, Claudie', 'Macoch, Melinda', 'Robineau, Marc', 'Sparfel, Lydie', 'Fardel, Olivier', 'Vernhet, Laurent']","['Morzadec C', 'Macoch M', 'Robineau M', 'Sparfel L', 'Fardel O', 'Vernhet L']","[""UMR INSERM U1085, Institut de Recherche sur lSante, l'Environnement et Travail, Universite de Rennes 1, 2 avenue du Professeur Leon Bernard, 35043 Rennes, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120519,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(12)00202-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2012.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2012 Aug 1;262(3):217-22. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2012.05.004.

However, the underlying relationship between apoptosis and telomerase activity in response to apigenin exposure is not well understood. In this study, we found that apigenin significantly induces direct cytotoxicity in human leukemia cells (U937, THP-1 and HL60) through activation of the caspase pathway. As we presumed, treatment with apigenin was found to increase the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas pretreatment with antioxidants, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH), completely attenuated ROS generation. Surprisingly, these antioxidants did not promote recuperation from apigenin-induced cell death. We further showed that apigenin downregulates telomerase activity in caspase-dependent apoptosis and observed that apigenin dosing results in downregulation of telomerase activity by suppression of c-Myc-mediated telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. In addition, treatment of apigenin-dosed cells with the two antioxidants did not restore telomerase activity. Taken together, this data suggests that ROS is not essential for suppression of apigenin-mediated apoptosis associated with the activation of caspases and regulation of telomerase activity via suppression of hTERT. We conclude that apigenin has a direct cytotoxic effect and the loss of telomerase activity in leukemia cells.","['Jayasooriya, R G P T', 'Kang, Sang-Hyuck', 'Kang, Chang-Hee', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Hyun, Jin-Won', 'Chang, Weon-Young', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Jayasooriya RG', 'Kang SH', 'Kang CH', 'Choi YH', 'Moon DO', 'Hyun JW', 'Chang WY', 'Kim GY']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120519,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00367-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2012 Aug;50(8):2605-11. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.024.

However, expression of genes encoding complex III was deregulated. Treatment with imatinib did not correct the aberrant levels of MRC genes.

Inhibitors of the key kinases in this pathway, including spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), have been found in preclinical models to decrease CLL cell viability both directly and indirectly through modulation of the microenvironment. Recently, oral agents targeting each of these kinases have been explored in early phase clinical trials in patients with CLL. BCR pathway antagonists appear to be highly active in relapsed/refractory CLL, independent of high-risk disease markers such as del(17p). These agents have shown a unique pattern of inducing early transient lymphocytosis, which typically is associated with nodal response. Here, we review the biology of the BCR, the kinases within this pathway and their interaction with the CLL microenvironment.

While corticosteroids have been used to treat CLL since 1940s, their benefit has never been conclusively proved. Recently, several groups reported use of high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or dexamethasone) either alone or combined with chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibodies in relapsed/refractory CLL. AREAS COVERED: While efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids is excellent including responses in patients with bulky lymphadenopathy or those considered ultra high-risk CLL because of deletion and/or mutation of p53 gene, the duration of response is still unsatisfactory. Combination with monoclonal antibodies seems to improve therapeutic efficacy but no randomized trials have been conducted. For the purpose of this review, a search for terms, high-dose corticosteroids/methylprednisolone/dexamethasone, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been performed in PubMed and database of abstracts from American Society of Hematology Meetings. EXPERT OPINION: High-dose corticosteroids appear to play an important role in the management of highly pretreated relapsed/refractory CLL including patients with massive lymphadenopathy. Myelosuppression is usually limited but infectious toxicity, including increased risk of invasive fungal infections, represents the most dreaded side effects. This therapeutic approach should be further tested within large prospective trials, to optimize efficacy and safety.","['Smolej, Lukas']",['Smolej L'],"['University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Second Department of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Sokolska 581, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. smolej@seznam.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120523,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.690393 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jul;21(7):1009-17. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.690393.

These findings have led many centres to change their policy from ""in-hospital"" to ""out-hospital care"". In this retrospective study we tried, on the basis of our experiences, to identify the feasibility and safety of this approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 56 patients with the acute myeloid leukemia treated in our clinic with the consolidation chemotherapy. We compared two groups of patients. In the first group, the patients were discharged upon completion of chemotherapy, consequently followed up as outpatients. Patients in the second group were observed in hospital during the entire nadir. Following 41 courses, patients were discharged and instructed to return immediately if fever or any other change of their clinical status occurred. RESULTS: In 24 cases after chemotherapy, the patients returned to the hospital after a discharge (in 23 cases because of fever), in 17 cases of nadir periods the hospitalisation was not necessary at all. Seven patients were readmitted in septic shock, but rapidly recovered. Two other patients died, one due to an irreversible shock within 12 hours of readmission and one due to bacterial meningitis within 48 hours after readmission. In 10 cases of rehospitalization, patients responded to the first line of antibiotics. In the second group of the patients, only 2 courses of consolidation from a total of 15 were not complicated. In contrast to the first group, we detected only poor effectiveness of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the group of inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: For AML patients in a good clinical status without any complicating medical conditions, the early discharge is feasible, safe and cost saving option (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 7).","['Sopko, L', 'Sabty, F Al', 'Rimajova, V', 'Roziakova, L', 'Elanova, A', 'Demeckova, E', 'Mistrik, M']","['Sopko L', 'Sabty FA', 'Rimajova V', 'Roziakova L', 'Elanova A', 'Demeckova E', 'Mistrik M']","['Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, University of Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia. sopko.ladislav@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,,2012/05/24 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/05/24 06:00'],"['2012/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/bll_2012_069 [doi]'],ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2012;113(5):298-300. doi: 10.4149/bll_2012_069.,20120807,,,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Bacterial Infections/complications', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Female', 'Fever/complications', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Discharge', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate their controversial prognostic impacts. The associations of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations with other molecular abnormalities were also investigated. In patients with AML, IDH1/2 mutations were significantly associated with normal karyotype and isolated trisomy 8 (p < .05). After adjusting for well-studied prognostic factors, IDH1 mutation seems to be associated with subtle but significantly inferior event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.02) and possible adverse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.13) in patients with AML, especially in the favorable genotype subset with mutated NPM1 but without FLT3-ITD mutation (p < 0.05). Longer OS (p = 0.01) and better EFS tendency (p = 0.18) are implicated in patients with IDH2 mutations, which suggests that IDH2 mutations appear to confer a favorable prognosis. Moreover, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may play a more important role in abnormal cytogenetics subgroups such as isolated trisomy 8.

Although the associations of the XMRV infection with human diseases appear unlikely, the XMRV is a retrovirus of undefined pathogenic potential, able to replicate in human cells in vitro. Since recent studies using animal models for infection have yielded conflicting results, we set out an ex vivo model for XMRV infection of human tonsillar tissue to determine whether XMRV produced by 22Rv1 cells is able to replicate in human lymphoid organs. Tonsil blocks were infected and infection kinetics and its pathogenic effects were monitored RESULTS: XMRV, though restricted by APOBEC, enters and integrates into the tissue cells. The infection did not result in changes of T or B-cells, immune activation, nor inflammatory chemokines. Infectious viruses could be recovered from supernatants of infected tonsils by reinfecting DERSE XMRV indicator cell line, although these supernatants could not establish a new infection in fresh tonsil culture, indicating that in our model, the viral replication is controlled by innate antiviral restriction factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the replication-competent retrovirus XMRV, present in a high number of laboratories, is able to infect human lymphoid tissue and produce infectious viruses, even though they were unable to establish a new infection in fresh tonsillar tissue. Hereby, laboratories working with cell lines producing XMRV should have knowledge and understanding of the potential biological biohazardous risks of this virus.","['Curriu, Marta', 'Carrillo, Jorge', 'Massanella, Marta', 'Garcia, Elisabet', 'Cunyat, Francesc', 'Pena, Ruth', 'Wienberg, Peter', 'Carrato, Cristina', 'Areal, Joan', 'Bofill, Margarita', 'Clotet, Bonaventura', 'Blanco, Julia', 'Cabrera, Cecilia']","['Curriu M', 'Carrillo J', 'Massanella M', 'Garcia E', 'Cunyat F', 'Pena R', 'Wienberg P', 'Carrato C', 'Areal J', 'Bofill M', 'Clotet B', 'Blanco J', 'Cabrera C']","['IrsiCaixa-HIVACAT, Institut de Recerca en Ciencies de la Salut Germans Trias i Pujol, Hospital Germans Trias, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Carretera del Canyet S/N, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3353939,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0037415 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-05522 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37415. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0037415.

In particular, upon longer IFN-beta treatments, cutaneous HPV38 expressing cells undergo senescence. IFN-beta appears to induce senescence by upregulating the expression of the tumor suppressor PML, a well known IFN-induced gene. Indeed, experiments in gene silencing via specific siRNAs have shown that PML is essential in the execution of the senescence programme and that both p53 and p21 pathways are involved. IFN-beta treatment leads to a modulation of p53 phosphorylation and acetylation status and a reduction in the expression of the p53 dominant negative DeltaNp73. These effects allow the recovery of p53 transactivating activity of target genes involved in the control of cell proliferation. Taken together, these studies suggest that signaling through the IFN pathway might play an important role in cellular senescence. This additional understanding of IFN antitumor action and mechanisms influencing tumor responsiveness or resistance appears useful in aiding further promising development of biomolecular strategies in the IFN therapy of cancer.","['Chiantore, Maria V', 'Vannucchi, Serena', 'Accardi, Rosita', 'Tommasino, Massimo', 'Percario, Zulema A', 'Vaccari, Gabriele', 'Affabris, Elisabetta', 'Fiorucci, Gianna', 'Romeo, Giovanna']","['Chiantore MV', 'Vannucchi S', 'Accardi R', 'Tommasino M', 'Percario ZA', 'Vaccari G', 'Affabris E', 'Fiorucci G', 'Romeo G']","['Department of Infectious, Parasitic and Immune-mediated Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20120516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3353995,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/09 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036909 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20746 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36909. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036909.

Its association with CFS is now largely discredited, and current results support a laboratory origin for XMRV with no reproducible evidence for infection of humans. However, some results indicating the presence of XMRV in prostate cancer are difficult to attribute to sample contamination. Here we have sought biological evidence that might confirm the presence of XMRV in prostate cancer samples previously having tested positive. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have tested for infectious XMRV and neutralizing antibodies against XMRV in blood plasma from 29 subjects with prostate cancer, and for infectious XMRV in prostate secretions from another five prostate cancer subjects. Nine of these subjects had previously tested positive for XMRV by PCR or by virus assay. We did not detect XMRV or related retroviruses in any sample, and the neutralizing activities of the plasma samples were all very low, a result inconsistent with XMRV infection of the plasma donors. CONCLUSIONS: We find no evidence for XMRV infection of any human subject tested, either by assay for infectious virus or for neutralizing antibodies. Our results are consistent with the majority of published studies on XMRV, which find that XMRV is not present in humans. The observed low to undetectable XMRV neutralization by human plasma indicates a lack of innate restriction of XMRV replication by soluble factors in human blood.","['Mendoza, Ramon', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Miller, A Dusty']","['Mendoza R', 'Silverman RH', 'Klein EA', 'Miller AD']","['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA080416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3353987,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036073 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-04248 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36073. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036073.

These cells were established from a human prostate tumor, CWR22, that was serially passaged in nude mice and selected for androgen independence. The 22Rv1 cells are known to produce high titers of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Recent studies suggested that XMRV was inadvertently created in the 1990's when two murine leukemia virus (MLV) genomes (pre-XMRV1 and pre-XMRV-2) recombined during passaging of the CWR22 tumor in mice. The conclusion that XMRV originated from mice and not the patient was based partly on the failure to detect XMRV in early CWR22 xenografts. While that deduction is certainly justified, we examined the possibility that a closely related virus could have been present in primary tumor tissue. Here we report that we have located the original prostate tumor tissue excised from patient CWR22 and have assayed the corresponding DNA by PCR and the tissue sections by fluorescence in situ hybridization for the presence of XMRV or a similar virus. The primary tumor tissues lacked mouse DNA as determined by PCR for intracisternal A type particle DNA, thus avoiding one of the limitations of studying xenografts. We show that neither XMRV nor a closely related virus was present in primary prostate tissue of patient CWR22. Our findings confirm and reinforce the conclusion that XMRV is a recombinant laboratory-generated mouse virus that is highly adapted for human prostate cancer cells.","['Das Gupta, Jaydip', 'Luk, Ka-Cheung', 'Tang, Ning', 'Gaughan, Christina', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Kandel, Eugene S', 'Hackett, John Jr', 'Silverman, Robert H']","['Das Gupta J', 'Luk KC', 'Tang N', 'Gaughan C', 'Klein EA', 'Kandel ES', 'Hackett J Jr', 'Silverman RH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA137708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA137708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3353988,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036072 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-04013 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36072. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036072.

In this study, its apoptosis and differentiation capabilities were evaluated by using the leukemia HL-60 cell line. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell prolifaration inhibition was estimated by MTT assay. The occurrence of apoptosis was evaluated by EtBr/AO double staining technique, cell cycle analyses and detection of apoptotic cells by Annexin V-FITC and propodium iodide (PI). Differentiation of the cells was determined by NBT reduction assay and the expression of specific cell surface markers such as CD14 and CD11b, were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The drug decreased the growth of the cells dose- and time-dependently and the IC(50) was found to be 1.3 microM. Our data suggested that Gn induced both monocytic differentiation and apoptosis among HL-60 cells. In addition, cell cycle analyses showed an increase in G1 phase population by 24 hrs, which was gradually replaced by Sub-G1 cell population (apoptotic cells) by 72 hrs. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, the Gn-treated HL-60 cells displayed differentiation-dependent apoptosis. Thus, Gn might be a good candidate for differentiation therapy of leukemia, pending full biological evaluation of the compound among the wide array of leukemia cells.","['Nouri, K', 'Yazdanparast, R']","['Nouri K', 'Yazdanparast R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,PMC3232095,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2011/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Daru. 2011;19(2):145-53.,20120823,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Differentiation', 'Gnidilatimonoein', 'HL-60', 'Leukemia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc mouthwash on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis lesions. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized trial, patients under chemotherapy for acute leukemia were divided into two test and control groups of 15 patients each. The groups were homogeneous with respect to medical history, tumor characteristics, and therapeutic details. The test group received 10ml 0.2% zinc sulfate mouthwash, and the control group received 10ml 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, twice a day for a period of two weeks. Spijkervet scale was used to grade the severity of mucositis at every other week during eight weeks. The severity scores were analyzed with repeated measure ANOVA using SPSS 13.0 computer software. RESULTS: Mean severity scores were generally lower in the test group compared to the controls at all four time intervals evaluated; but only, the differences in weeks of 2 and 3 were statistically significant (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: Zinc mouthwash used in conjunction with chemotherapy may reduce the severity of oral mucositis lesions in patients with leukaemia.","['Mehdipour, M', 'Taghavi Zenoz, A', 'Asvadi Kermani, I', 'Hosseinpour, A']","['Mehdipour M', 'Taghavi Zenoz A', 'Asvadi Kermani I', 'Hosseinpour A']","['Department of Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,PMC3232076,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2010/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Daru. 2011;19(1):71-3.,20120823,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological malignancies', 'Oral hygiene', 'Palliative care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst dexamethasone (Dex) is routinely used for the control of APL- differentiation syndrome, its effect on the pharmacodynamics of ATO is not clear. Therefore, in this study, effects of therapeutic concentrations of ATO, ATRA and Dex and their sequential usages on the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in t(15;17)-positive NB4 cells was investigated. METHODS: Cells were treated with therapeutic concentrations of ATO, ATRA and Dex either as single or in combination and cell proliferation was assessed by XTT assay. Expression of CD11b as an indicator of cell differentiation and the percentage of 7-AAD positive cells as a marker of apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: ATO, but not ATRA and Dex, decreased proliferation of the cells dose-dependently. Pre-treatment of the cells with any of the drugs did not alter the effects of other drugs on the proliferation. Pre-treatments with Dex blocked the apoptotic effect of ATO (1 microM). CONCLUSION: No improvement or antagonistic effects was observed with the pretreatment/ combination of the ATO and ATRA on the differentiation and apoptosis of the cells. It is possible that concomitant usage of Dex with apoptotic doses of ATO in APL patients counteract therapeutic effects of ATO.","['Mandegary, A', 'Mehrabani, M']","['Mandegary A', 'Mehrabani M']","['Pharmaceutics Research Center and Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,PMC3304349,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Daru. 2010;18(4):303-9.,20120823,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATO', 'ATRA', 'Apoptosis.', 'Combination therapy', 'Dexamethasone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, KDM3B displayed histone H3K9-me1/2 demethylase activity and induced leukemogenic oncogene lmo2 expression via a synergistic interaction with CBP. Here, we found that KDM3B repressed leukemia cell differentiation and was upregulated in blood cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type leukemia patients.

However, they are associated with the development of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias (t-AMLs), which display characteristic balanced chromosome translocations, most often involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) locus at 11q23. MLL translocation breakpoints in t-AMLs cluster in a DNase I hypersensitive region, which possesses cryptic promoter activity, implicating transcription as well as topoisomerase II activity in the translocation mechanism. We find that 2-3% of MLL alleles undergoing transcription do so in close proximity to one of its recurrent translocation partner genes, AF9 or AF4, consistent with their sharing transcription factories. We show that most etoposide-induced chromosome breaks in the MLL locus and the overall genotoxicity of etoposide are dependent on topoisomerase IIbeta, but that topoisomerase IIalpha and -beta occupancy and etoposide-induced DNA cleavage data suggest factors other than local topoisomerase II concentration determine specific clustering of MLL translocation breakpoints in t-AML. We propose a model where DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by topoisomerase IIbeta into pairs of genes undergoing transcription within a common transcription factory become stabilized by antitopoisomerase II drugs such as etoposide, providing the opportunity for illegitimate end joining and translocation.","['Cowell, Ian G', 'Sondka, Zbyslaw', 'Smith, Kayleigh', 'Lee, Ka Cheong', 'Manville, Catriona M', 'Sidorczuk-Lesthuruge, Malgorzata', 'Rance, Holly Ashlene', 'Padget, Kay', 'Jackson, Graham Hunter', 'Adachi, Noritaka', 'Austin, Caroline A']","['Cowell IG', 'Sondka Z', 'Smith K', 'Lee KC', 'Manville CM', 'Sidorczuk-Lesthuruge M', 'Rance HA', 'Padget K', 'Jackson GH', 'Adachi N', 'Austin CA']","['Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['BB/E528460/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/G529383/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3384169,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1204406109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1204406109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jun 5;109(23):8989-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1204406109.

The potential role for LRF in cells of the CNS has not been examined to date. This study shows prominent nuclear expression of LRF in diverse neuronal populations and in oligodendrocytes. We focused on examining the function of LRF during the transition from oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) to mature oligodendrocyte that is associated with myelination in the postnatal spinal cord. During spinal cord myelination, LRF is expressed in only a minority of OP cells whereas most mature oligodendrocytes exhibited nuclear LRF immunoreactivity. Mice with floxed alleles of the Zbtb7a gene, which encodes for LRF protein, were used for in vivo analysis of LRF function. Lentiviral driven Cre recombinase inactivation of LRF at postnatal day 7 reduced the proportion of OP cells that differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes by postnatal day 28. Astrocyte populations were not altered by LRF deletion in the same tissues. These results indicate that LRF deletion reduces differentiation within the oligodendrocyte lineage and does not alter OP lineage choice. In vitro analysis confirmed a specific effect of LRF on OP differentiation. In neonatal OP cultures, RNA interference targeting LRF inhibited OP differentiation while LRF transduction was sufficient to induce differentiation into oligodendrocytes. These results support a critical role for LRF in transcriptional control of differentiation in oligodendrocyte lineage cells during developmental myelination in the CNS.","['Dobson, Nicole R', 'Moore, Ryan T', 'Tobin, Jennifer E', 'Armstrong, Regina C']","['Dobson NR', 'Moore RT', 'Tobin JE', 'Armstrong RC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['NS39293/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'RG4224/RG/CSR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120521,United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.22356 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2012 Sep;60(9):1378-90. doi: 10.1002/glia.22356.

In this study, we identified Zbtb46 (BTBD4) as a transcription factor selectively expressed by classical DCs (cDCs) and their committed progenitors but not by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), monocytes, macrophages, or other lymphoid or myeloid lineages. Using homologous recombination, we replaced the first coding exon of Zbtb46 with GFP to inactivate the locus while allowing detection of Zbtb46 expression. GFP expression in Zbtb46(gfp/+) mice recapitulated the cDC-specific expression of the native locus, being restricted to cDC precursors (pre-cDCs) and lymphoid organ- and tissue-resident cDCs. GFP(+) pre-cDCs had restricted developmental potential, generating cDCs but not pDCs, monocytes, or macrophages. Outside the immune system, Zbtb46 was expressed in committed erythroid progenitors and endothelial cell populations. Zbtb46 overexpression in bone marrow progenitor cells inhibited granulocyte potential and promoted cDC development, and although cDCs developed in Zbtb46(gfp/gfp) (Zbtb46 deficient) mice, they maintained expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and leukemia inhibitory factor receptors, which are normally down-regulated in cDCs. Thus, Zbtb46 may help enforce cDC identity by restricting responsiveness to non-DC growth factors and may serve as a useful marker to identify rare cDC progenitors and distinguish between cDCs and other mononuclear phagocyte lineages.","['Satpathy, Ansuman T', 'KC, Wumesh', 'Albring, Jorn C', 'Edelson, Brian T', 'Kretzer, Nicole M', 'Bhattacharya, Deepta', 'Murphy, Theresa L', 'Murphy, Kenneth M']","['Satpathy AT', 'KC W', 'Albring JC', 'Edelson BT', 'Kretzer NM', 'Bhattacharya D', 'Murphy TL', 'Murphy KM']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P30 CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007163/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020579/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AI076427-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI076427/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120521,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC3371733,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20120030 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20120030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2012 Jun 4;209(6):1135-52. doi: 10.1084/jem.20120030.

It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (>1 x 10(9) L(-1) ) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months. Patients may present with symptoms related to cytopenias and/or an underlying hypercatabolic state with drenching night sweats, splenomegaly, and weight loss. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic, and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow, after careful exclusion of other conditions (both malignant and nonmalignant) that can cause monocytosis. Numerous molecular abnormalities have been recently recognized in patients with CMML-unfortunately, no single pathognomonic finding specific to CMML has been identified thus far. RISK STRATIFICATION: The International Prognostic Scoring System for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cannot be used to risk stratify patients with CMML because this model excluded patients with a leukocyte count >12 x 10(9) L(-1) . Other risk stratification models such as the MD Anderson prognostic score and Dusseldorf score have been published. In the only model that took karyotype into account, bone marrow blasts >/= 10%, leukocyte count >/= 13 x 10(9) L(-1) , hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, platelet count < 100 x 10(9) L(-1) , and presence of trisomy 8, abnormalities of chromosome 7, or complex karyotype were found to be independent predictors of adverse survival. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML based on two pivotal trials in MDS. Novel classes of agents including immunomodulatory drugs, nucleoside analogs, and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being investigated in the treatment of CMML. With the advent of reduced intensity conditioning, an allogeneic stem cell transplant has also become a viable option for a subset of patients.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Parikh SA', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/07/26 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23203 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Jun;87(6):610-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23203.,20120725,10.1002/ajh.23203 [doi],,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Decitabine', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluate associations between decision-making styles and actual treatment. METHODS Data were collected from women treated outside of clinical trials for newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer (83% response) from January 2004 through April 2011 in 75 cooperative group sites. Physicians completed a one-time mailed survey (91% response), and clinical data were abstracted from charts. Patient decision style was measured on a five-point scale. Oncologists' preference for prescribing chemotherapy was based on standardized vignettes. Regression and multiple imputation were used to assess associations between chemotherapy and other variables. Results There were 1,174 women seen by 212 oncologists; 43% of women received chemotherapy. One-third of women preferred to make their own treatment decision. Patient and physician decision styles were independently associated with chemotherapy. Women who preferred less physician input had lower odds of chemotherapy than women who preferred more input (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79 per 1-point change; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; P = .02) after considering covariates. Patients whose oncologists had a high chemotherapy preference had higher odds of receiving chemotherapy (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.80 to 3.89; P < .001) than those who saw oncologists with a low preference. CONCLUSION Physicians' and older patients' decision styles are each associated with breast cancer chemotherapy use. It will be important to re-evaluate the impact of decision styles when there is greater empirical evidence about the benefits and risks of chemotherapy in older patients.","['Mandelblatt, Jeanne S', 'Faul, Leigh Anne', 'Luta, George', 'Makgoeng, Solomon B', 'Isaacs, Claudine', 'Taylor, Kathryn', 'Sheppard, Vanessa B', 'Tallarico, Michelle', 'Barry, William T', 'Cohen, Harvey J']","['Mandelblatt JS', 'Faul LA', 'Luta G', 'Makgoeng SB', 'Isaacs C', 'Taylor K', 'Sheppard VB', 'Tallarico M', 'Barry WT', 'Cohen HJ']","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, 3300 Whitehaven Blvd, Washington, DC 20007, USA. mandelbj@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],"['U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA51008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA166342/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA084131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA138077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO5 CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 84131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 CA096940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC3413274,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.40.2909 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.40.2909 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul 20;30(21):2609-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.40.2909.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: By using the Adolescent and Young Adult Health Outcomes and Patient Experience Study (AYA HOPE)-a cohort of 463 recently diagnosed patients age 15 to 39 years with germ cell cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sarcoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia from participating Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries-we evaluated factors associated with return to work/school after cancer diagnosis, a belief that cancer had a negative impact on plans for work/school, and reported problems with work/school after diagnosis by using descriptive statistics, chi(2) tests, and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: More than 72% (282 of 388) of patients working or in school full-time before diagnosis had returned to full-time work or school 15 to 35 months postdiagnosis compared with 34% (14 of 41) of previously part-time workers/students, 7% (one of 14) of homemakers, and 25% (five of 20) of unemployed/disabled patients (P < .001). Among full-time workers/students before diagnosis, patients who were uninsured (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.67; no insurance v employer-/school-sponsored insurance) or quit working directly after diagnosis (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.37; quit v no change) were least likely to return. Very intensive cancer treatment and quitting work/school were associated with a belief that cancer negatively influenced plans for work/school. Finally, more than 50% of full-time workers/students reported problems with work/studies after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although most AYA patients with cancer return to work after cancer, treatment intensity, not having insurance, and quitting work/school directly after diagnosis can influence work/educational outcomes. Future research should investigate underlying causes for these differences and best practices for effective transition of these cancer survivors to the workplace/school after treatment.","['Parsons, Helen M', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Kato, Ikuko', 'Schwartz, Stephen M', 'Smith, Ashley W', 'Keel, Gretchen', 'Keegan, Theresa H M']","['Parsons HM', 'Harlan LC', 'Lynch CF', 'Hamilton AS', 'Wu XC', 'Kato I', 'Schwartz SM', 'Smith AW', 'Keel G', 'Keegan TH']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, Mail Code 7933, San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, USA. parsonsh@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['N01-PC-35145/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35142/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC54402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35139/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC54404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-54404/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-54402/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35143/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35136/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120521,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC3675694,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.6333 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.6333 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul 1;30(19):2393-400. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.6333.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifty-six patients received risk-adapted therapy with a modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-ALL treatment. High-risk ALL was defined by MRD >/= 1 x 10(-3) at week 12 and/or poor prednisolone response, BCR-ABL1, MLL gene rearrangements, hypodiploid less than 45 chromosomes, or induction failure; standard-risk ALL was defined by MRD </= 1 x 10(-4) at weeks 5 and 12 and no extramedullary involvement or high-risk features. Intermediate-risk ALL included all remaining patients. RESULTS: Patients who lacked high-risk presenting features (85.7%) received remission induction therapy with dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase, without anthracyclines. Six-year event-free survival (EFS) was 80.6% +/- 3.5%; overall survival was 88.4% +/- 3.1%. Standard-risk patients (n = 172; 31%) received significantly deintensified subsequent therapy without compromising EFS (93.2% +/- 4.1%). High-risk patients (n = 101; 18%) had the worst EFS (51.8% +/- 10%); EFS was 83.6% +/- 4.9% in intermediate-risk patients (n = 283; 51%). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate significant progress over previous trials in the region. Three-drug remission-induction therapy combined with MRD-based risk stratification to identify poor responders is an effective strategy for childhood ALL.","['Yeoh, Allen Eng Juh', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Chai, Elaine Li Leng', 'Kwok, Cecilia Sze Nga', 'Chan, Yiong Huak', 'Ponnudurai, Kuperan', 'Campana, Dario', 'Tan, Poh Lin', 'Chan, Mei Yoke', 'Kham, Shirley Kow Yin', 'Chong, Lee Ai', 'Tan, Ah Moy', 'Lin, Hai Peng', 'Quah, Thuan Chong']","['Yeoh AE', 'Ariffin H', 'Chai EL', 'Kwok CS', 'Chan YH', 'Ponnudurai K', 'Campana D', 'Tan PL', 'Chan MY', 'Kham SK', 'Chong LA', 'Tan AM', 'Lin HP', 'Quah TC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, National University Health System, Tower Block, 1E, Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore. allen_yeoh@nuhs.edu.sg']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.40.5936 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.40.5936 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul 1;30(19):2384-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.40.5936.

Rap1GAP is thought of as a putative tumor suppressor gene and plays an important role in human tumor progression including pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer and melanoma. In the current study, we found that the expression of Rap1GAP was lower in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared to non-malignant blood disease patients. The expression of Rap1GAP was also low in HL-60, NB4, U937 and SHI-1 myeloid leukemia cell lines. Upregulated Rap1GAP in NB4 and HL-60 cells promoted cell differentiation induced by ATRA or TPA compared to the empty vector control cells. Furthermore, Rap1GAP-transfected cells also showed a higher rate of apoptosis in response to arsenic trioxide compared to the control counterpart cells. In addition, we found that increased expression of Rap1GAP promoted leukemia cell invasion may be due to matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). In conclusion, these results demonstrated that Rap1GAP promoted leukemia cell differentiation and apoptosis, but increased leukemia cell invasion in vitro.","['Qiu, Tingting', 'Qi, Xiaofei', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Chen, Zixing']","['Qiu T', 'Qi X', 'Cen J', 'Chen Z']","['Leukemia Research Unit, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Af fi liated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1825 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Aug;28(2):622-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1825.

Topoisomerase II is a major constituent of chromosome scaffold, existing at appreciable amounts in cells. To examine the effects of etoposide on the cell cycle, hexaploid H1 (ES) cells (6H1 cells) were used with diploid H1 (ES) cells (2H1 cells) as a control. Exponentially growing 2H1 and 6H1 cells were exposed to etoposide at various concentrations, and cultured for about 60 days in L15F10 medium with leukemia inhibitory factor. With a high concentration of etoposide (1 muM), the DNA histograms showed G(2)/M accumulation, suggesting that etoposide arrested the cell cycle at the G(2)/M phase. With a low concentration of etoposide (50 nM), the cell proliferation was suppressed with a doubling time of 98.4 h for 2H1 cells and 51.6 h for 6H1 cells, and without significant alteration in DNA histograms. Time-lapse videography revealed that 6H1 cells survived in the medium containing 50 nM etoposide had a cell cycle time of 18.8 h, which was equivalent to 19.2 h of the doubling time for the 6H1 cell population in drug-free medium, suggesting that a part of the cell population died and was excluded from the cell system.

However, the effect and regulatory mechanism of CPT remain unclear in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of CPT on the multidrug resistant CML cells K562/ADM. Our results demonstrated that CPT decreased the cell viability of K562/ADM cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through suppressing the expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. Further studies indicated that CPT mainly functions at post-transcriptional levels, suggesting the involvement of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CPT significantly reduced the expression and activity of eIF4E in K562/ADM cells. Overexpression of eIF4E obvious conferred resistance to the CPT antiproliferation and proapoptotic activity as well as the cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expressions. Knockdown of eIF4E significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of CPT in K562/ADM, confirming the participation of eIF4E during CPT function process. More importantly, the relative inhibitory efficiency of CPT positively correlated with the reductions on eIF4E in primary CML specimens. These results demonstrated that CPT played antitumor roles in K562/ADM cells by inhibiting the eIF4E regulatory system.

Existing studies describing RH focus on AHT and have potential selection bias. We undertook a prospective observational study to define the prevalence, distribution, and extent of RH in critically ill children. METHODS: From February 2008 to December 2009, emergency intensive care admissions >/= 6 weeks of age underwent dilated retinal examination by either a pediatric ophthalmologist or RetCam (retinal photograph) imaging after written informed consent. Patients with suspected or proven AHT, penetrating eye trauma, and elective admissions were excluded. RESULTS: The prevalence of RH was 15.1% (24/159; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.5%-21%); 16/24 (66%) mild, and 2/24 (8%) moderate. Severe multilayered RH were seen in only 6 patients (3.7%), 3 with myeloid leukemia and sepsis, 2 with severe accidental head injury, and 1 with severe coagulopathy secondary to late onset hemorrhagic disease of newborn. There was no detectable impact of age, gender, seizures, coagulopathy or cardiopulmonary resuscitation on prevalence of severe multilayered RH; however, sepsis (odds ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.3-8.0, P = .018) and coagulopathy (odds ratio: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2-7.0, P = .025) were significantly associated with any RH. Only admission diagnosis was independently associated with severe multilayered RH on logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: RHs were seen in critically ill children with a prevalence of 15.1% (24/159); however, most were mild. Severe multilayered RH resembling those described in AHT were rare (6/24) and were only seen in patients with fatal accidental trauma, severe coagulopathy, sepsis with myeloid leukemia, or a combination of these factors.","['Agrawal, Shruti', 'Peters, Mark J', 'Adams, Gillian G W', 'Pierce, Christine M']","['Agrawal S', 'Peters MJ', 'Adams GG', 'Pierce CM']","['Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom. shragrawal@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120521,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2011-2772 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2011-2772 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2012 Jun;129(6):e1388-96. doi: 10.1542/peds.2011-2772.

The rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation is the removal of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases. However, studies on deadenylase expression in cancer are limited. Herein, we analyzed the expression of several deadenylases from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Clinical samples from patients diagnosed with ALL and AML were the source of leukemic cells. Extracts from leukemic and control cells were analyzed for deadenylase mRNA levels using qRT-PCR, and the protein levels of PARN and CNOT7 deadenylases using immunoblotting. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis revealed altered expression for CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7 and PARN deadenylases. The most significant alterations were observed for PARN and CNOT7 mRNA levels, which also reflect on the cognate protein level. Further analysis revealed that a significant amount of PARN is phosphorylated in ALL. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the expression of several deadenylases in acute leukemias is altered. The increase of PARN expression and the alteration of its phosphorylation status indicate important regulatory events. These data suggest that the role of deadenylases as auxiliary biomarkers and therapeutic targets should be meticulously investigated.","['Maragozidis, Panayiotis', 'Karangeli, Maria', 'Labrou, Maria', 'Dimoulou, Georgia', 'Papaspyrou, Konstantia', 'Salataj, Eralda', 'Pournaras, Spyridon', 'Matsouka, Panagiota', 'Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I', 'Balatsos, Nikolaos A A']","['Maragozidis P', 'Karangeli M', 'Labrou M', 'Dimoulou G', 'Papaspyrou K', 'Salataj E', 'Pournaras S', 'Matsouka P', 'Gourgoulianis KI', 'Balatsos NA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000337418 [pii]', '10.1159/000337418 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;128(1):39-46. doi: 10.1159/000337418.

The aim of this study was to present our experience on patients previously diagnosed with haematological malignancies who subsequently underwent cardiac surgery. We include data to assist other surgeons predict factors affecting postoperative morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. METHODS: Fifteen patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies who had cardiac surgery were retrospectively analysed. Eight patients had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, six had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the rest had chronic myelocytic leukaemia. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery was performed on all of them. RESULTS: There were no hospital mortalities. The average follow-up period was 35 +/- 11 (23-56) months. Three patients required early postoperative re-operation because of excessive bleeding. No mortalities were seen in the early postoperative period. There were five (33%) deaths during the late follow-up period. Three patients were lost due to intracranial bleeding (confirmed by autopsy) in the 16th, 23rd and 38th months after surgery. The remaining two patients had sudden death in the eighth and 55th months from nondetectable causes. CONCLUSION: Cardiac surgery can be performed with acceptable early postoperative outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies. Intracranial bleeding is an important factor contributing to late mortality and patient selection and risk stratification are crucial to improving surgical benefits.","['Guler, A', 'Sahin, M A', 'Cingoz, F', 'Ozal, E', 'Demirkilic, U', 'Arslan, M']","['Guler A', 'Sahin MA', 'Cingoz F', 'Ozal E', 'Demirkilic U', 'Arslan M']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Etlik, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,South Africa,Cardiovasc J Afr,Cardiovascular journal of Africa,101313864,PMC3721910,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5830/CVJA-2011-053 [doi]'],ppublish,Cardiovasc J Afr. 2012 May;23(4):194-6. doi: 10.5830/CVJA-2011-053.,20130206,10.5830/CVJA-2011-053 [doi],,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/complications/mortality/*surgery', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-ALL accounts for 15% of newly diagnosed ALL cases in children and 25% in adults. Although the prognosis of T-ALL has improved, due to the use of polychemotherapy schemes, the outcome of relapsed/chemoresistant T-ALL cases is still poor. A signaling pathway that is frequently upregulated in T-ALL, is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR network. To explore whether Akt could represent a target for therapeutic intervention in T-ALL, we evaluated the effects of the novel allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, on a panel of human T-ALL cell lines and primary cells from T-ALL patients. MK-2206 decreased T-ALL cell line viability by blocking leukemic cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. MK-2206 also induced autophagy, as demonstrated by an increase in the 14-kDa form of LC3A/B. Western blotting analysis documented a concentration-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets, GSK-3alpha/beta and FOXO3A, in response to MK-2206. MK-2206 was cytotoxic to primary T-ALL cells and induced apoptosis in a T-ALL patient cell subset (CD34(+)/CD4(-)/CD7(-)), which is enriched in leukemia-initiating cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that Akt inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in T-ALL.","['Simioni, C', 'Neri, L M', 'Tabellini, G', 'Ricci, F', 'Bressanin, D', 'Chiarini, F', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Cani, A', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Melchionda, F', 'Pagliaro, P', 'Pession, A', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Capitani, S', 'Martelli, A M']","['Simioni C', 'Neri LM', 'Tabellini G', 'Ricci F', 'Bressanin D', 'Chiarini F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Cani A', 'Tazzari PL', 'Melchionda F', 'Pagliaro P', 'Pession A', 'McCubrey JA', 'Capitani S', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012136 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.136 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2336-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.136.

A key driver of AML is the FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3). Activating mutations in FLT3, primarily the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), are associated with decreased progression-free and overall survival. Identification of the importance of FLT3-ITD and the FLT3 pathway in the prognosis of patients with AML has stimulated efforts to develop therapeutic inhibitors of FLT3. Although these inhibitors have shown promising antileukemic activity, they have had limited efficacy to date as single agents and may require use in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies. Here, we review clinical and preclinical results for the clinically mature FLT3 inhibitors currently in development. We conclude that multitargeted FLT3 inhibitors may have more utility earlier in the course of disease, when in vitro evidence suggests that AML cells are less dependent on FLT3 signaling, perhaps because of upregulation of multiple other signaling pathways. More potent agents may have greater utility in relapsed and heavily pretreated patients, in whom high levels of circulating FLT3 ligand may necessitate use of an agent with a very favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile. Novel combination regimens are also discussed.","['Swords, R', 'Freeman, C', 'Giles, F']","['Swords R', 'Freeman C', 'Giles F']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Leonard M.

In virally associated cancers, the host-pathogen interaction could involve alteration in miR expression. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EBNA2 is indispensable for the capacity of the virus to transform B cells in vitro. Here, we studied how it affects cellular miRs. Extensive miR profiling of the virus-infected and EBNA2-transfected B lymphoma cells revealed that oncomiR miR-21 is positively regulated by this viral protein. Conversely, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines infected with EBNA2 lacking P3HR1 strain did not show any increase in miR-21. EBNA2 increased phosphorylation of AKT and this was directly correlated with increased miR-21. In contrast, miR-146a was downregulated by EBNA2 in B lymphoma cells. Low miR-146a expression correlates with an elevated level of IRAK1 and type I interferon in EBNA2 transfectants. Taken together, the present data suggest that EBNA2 might contribute to EBV-induced B-cell transformation by altering miR expression and in particular by increasing oncomiR-like miR-21 and by affecting the antiviral responses of the innate immune system through downregulation of its key regulator miR-146a.","['Rosato, P', 'Anastasiadou, E', 'Garg, N', 'Lenze, D', 'Boccellato, F', 'Vincenti, S', 'Severa, M', 'Coccia, E M', 'Bigi, R', 'Cirone, M', 'Ferretti, E', 'Campese, A F', 'Hummel, M', 'Frati, L', 'Presutti, C', 'Faggioni, A', 'Trivedi, P']","['Rosato P', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Garg N', 'Lenze D', 'Boccellato F', 'Vincenti S', 'Severa M', 'Coccia EM', 'Bigi R', 'Cirone M', 'Ferretti E', 'Campese AF', 'Hummel M', 'Frati L', 'Presutti C', 'Faggioni A', 'Trivedi P']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci-Bolognetti, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3496086,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012108 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2343-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.108.

The myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, MPL, a homodimeric receptor activated by thrombopoietin (THPO), is mutated in myeloproliferative disorders but rarely in AML. Here we show that wild-type MPL expression is increased in a fraction of human AML samples expressing RUNX1-ETO, a fusion protein created by chromosome translocation t(8;21), and that up-regulation of Mpl expression in mice induces AML when coexpressed with RUNX1-ETO. The leukemic cells are sensitive to THPO, activating survival and proliferative responses. Mpl expression is not regulated by RUNX1-ETO in mouse hematopoietic progenitors or leukemic cells. Moreover, we find that activation of PI3K/AKT but not ERK/MEK pathway is a critical mediator of the MPL-directed antiapoptotic function in leukemic cells. Hence, this study provides evidence that up-regulation of wild-type MPL levels promotes leukemia development and maintenance through activation of the PI3K/AKT axis, and suggests that inhibitors of this axis could be effective for treatment of MPL-positive AML.","['Pulikkan, John Anto', 'Madera, Dmitri', 'Xue, Liting', 'Bradley, Paul', 'Landrette, Sean Francis', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Abbas, Saman', 'Zhu, Lihua Julie', 'Valk, Peter', 'Castilla, Lucio Hernan']","['Pulikkan JA', 'Madera D', 'Xue L', 'Bradley P', 'Landrette SF', 'Kuo YH', 'Abbas S', 'Zhu LJ', 'Valk P', 'Castilla LH']","['Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA096983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI042845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK32520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA130807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK032520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AI042845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3412349,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46586-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-414649 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):868-79. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-414649.

The expected survival for patients diagnosed with CML today, if properly managed, is probably similar to that of the general population. When managing patients with CML the goal is to achieve the best long-term outcome and we should base the treatment decisions on the data available. The results from cytogenetic and molecular analyses have to be interpreted judiciously and all available treatment options integrated into the treatment plan properly. The availability of several treatment options in CML is an asset, but the temptation of rapid succession of treatment changes because of perceived suboptimal response or for adverse events that could be managed needs to be avoided. Any decision to change therapy needs to weigh the expected long-term outcome with the current option versus the true expectations with any new option, particularly as it relates to irreversible outcomes, such as transformation to blast phase and death.

In this study, we undertook to elucidate the signaling intermediates responsible for this biologic alteration. In responding cells only, in vitro BCR engagement triggers global phosphorylation of Syk, activation of phospholipase Cgamma2, and intracellular calcium mobilization, reflecting competency of BCR signaling. The calcium-calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT2 is up-regulated and to some extent constitutively activated in all CLL B cells. In contrast, its DNA-binding capacity is enhanced on IgM stimulation in responding cells only. NFAT inhibition using the VIVIT peptide prevents induction of CD23 target gene and IgM-induced survival, converting responding cells to unresponsive status. At the opposite, ionomycin-induced NFAT activity allows survival of nonresponding cells. These results demonstrate that the functional heterogeneity relies on variability of protein levels establishing BCR-dependent thresholds and NFAT-dependent activation. Finally, status of the BCR-NFAT pathway for each patient reveals its relevance for CLL clinical outcome and points out to BCR-NFAT intermediates as promising functional therapeutic targets.","['Le Roy, Christine', 'Deglesne, Pierre-Antoine', 'Chevallier, Nathalie', 'Beitar, Taoufik', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Quettier, Maude', 'Boubaya, Marouane', 'Letestu, Remi', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine']","['Le Roy C', 'Deglesne PA', 'Chevallier N', 'Beitar T', 'Eclache V', 'Quettier M', 'Boubaya M', 'Letestu R', 'Levy V', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Varin-Blank N']","['INSERM U978, Universite Paris 13, Adaptateurs de Signalisation en Hematologie, UFR-SMBH, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, Bobigny Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47543-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-397158 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 12;120(2):356-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-397158.

Here, we propose that vimentin, a protein comprising type III intermediate filament, participates in such cross-talk for CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) production in mast cells, which is a mechanism for allergic inflammation. Co-stimulation via FcepsilonRI, using IgE/antigen, and CCR1, using recombinant CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), increased expression of phosphorylated, disassembled, and soluble vimentin in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1 cells) and bone marrow-derived murine mast cells, both models of mucosal type mast cells. Furthermore, co-stimulation enhanced production of CCL2 as well as phosphorylation of MAPK. Treating the cells with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not with MEK inhibitor PD98058, reduced CCL2 production, suggesting that p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2, plays a critical role in the chemokine production. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that vimentin interacts with phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in the co-simulated cells. Preventing disassembly of the vimentin by aggregating vimentin filaments using beta,beta'-iminodipropionitrile reduced the interaction of vimentin with phosphorylated MAPKs as well as CCL2 production in the cells. Taken together, disassembled vimentin interacting with phosphorylated p38 MAPK could mediate CCL2 production in mast cells upon FcepsilonRI and CCR1 activation.","['Toda, Masako', 'Kuo, Chuan-Hui', 'Borman, Satty K', 'Richardson, Ricardo Micheler', 'Inoko, Akihito', 'Inagaki, Masaki', 'Collins, Andrea', 'Schneider, Klaus', 'Ono, Santa Jeremy']","['Toda M', 'Kuo CH', 'Borman SK', 'Richardson RM', 'Inoko A', 'Inagaki M', 'Collins A', 'Schneider K', 'Ono SJ']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45221-0097,USA.""]",['eng'],"['AI-38910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY-019630-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AI038910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY019630/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3397876,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43300-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.319624 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jul 13;287(29):24516-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.319624.

The bottleneck is evidence that leukemia initiation, by in utero acquired chromosome translocations that generate functional fusion genes, is far more common than the incidence rate of corresponding leukemia. For childhood TEL-AML1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) this equates to approximately 100 times. Practically this means that among a hundred children born with TEL-AML1 fusion gene, only one child will later in its life develop ALL. The key data necessary for unraveling of this mystery were discovered in 2002. It was the level of TEL-AML1(+) cells' frequency. The bottleneck is caused by the very low body TEL-AML1(+) cell count. Only one out of a thousand B cells carries TEL-AML1 fusion gene. TEL-AML1(+) body cell count is low because TEL-AML1 fusion is generated at cell level of 10(-3) to 10(-4) just during the late fetal lymphopoiesis i.e. after the 36th gestational week.","['Ivanovski, Petar', 'Ivanovski, Ivan', 'Nikolic, Dimitrije', 'Jovanovic, Ivana']","['Ivanovski P', 'Ivanovski I', 'Nikolic D', 'Jovanovic I']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital, School of Medicine University of Belgrade, Serbia. ivanovsk@eunet.rs""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2012 Mar;125(6):1182-5.,20120926,,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, the MLL-AF9 fusion oncogene is thought to contribute to myeloid leukemogenesis by driving a hematopoietic stem cell-like ""self-renewal"" gene expression signature in committed myeloid progenitors. In addition, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling has been implicated in self-renewal/pluripotency in hematopoietic and embryonic stem cell contexts and supports cell growth/survival by activation of downstream pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We hypothesized that IGF signaling could be an important contributor in the process of cellular transformation and/or clonal propagation. Utilizing an MLL-AF9 mouse bone marrow transplantation model of acute myelogenous leukemia, we discovered that committed myeloid progenitor cells with genetically reduced levels of IGF1R were less susceptible to leukemogenic transformation due, at least in part, to a cell-autonomous defect in clonogenic activity. Rather unexpectedly, genetic deletion of IGF1R by inducible Cre recombinase had no effect on growth/survival of established leukemia cells. These findings suggest that IGF1R signaling contributes to transformation of normal myeloid progenitor cells, but is not required for propagation of the leukemic clone once it has become established. We also show that treatment of mouse MLL-AF9 acute myelogenous leukemia cells with BMS-536924, an IGF1R/insulin receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked cell growth, suggesting its efficacy in this model may be due to inhibition of insulin receptor and/or related tyrosine kinases, and raising the possibility that similar IGF1R inhibitors in clinical development may be acting through alternate/related pathways.","['Jenkins, Christopher R', 'Shevchuk, Olena O', 'Giambra, Vincenzo', 'Lam, Sonya H', 'Carboni, Joan M', 'Gottardis, Marco M', 'Holzenberger, Martin', 'Pollak, Michael', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Jenkins CR', 'Shevchuk OO', 'Giambra V', 'Lam SH', 'Carboni JM', 'Gottardis MM', 'Holzenberger M', 'Pollak M', 'Humphries RK', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory/Department of Pathology, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00178-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Sep;40(9):715-723.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.003.

Although many myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemic patients have compromised immunity, the role of underlying mutations in regulating immune function is poorly understood. Recent studies show that NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene results in myelodysplastic syndrome and impairs lymphocyte differentiation in transgenic mice. In our studies, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which NHD13 affects B-lymphocyte development and function. Based on our preliminary findings that transgenic mice had increased levels of IgM and reduced IgG1 and IgE, we hypothesized that the fusion gene might impair class switch recombination (CSR). Mice were immunologically challenged with dinitrophenol. NHD13 mice showed a marked reduction in B-lymphocyte differentiation in their bone marrow and spleen following dinitrophenol stimulation and had reduced production of dinitrophenol-specific antibodies. Spleen follicles from these mice were small and hypocellular, indicating failure of clonal expansion. When isolated NHD13 B lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro using Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide + interleukin-4, they failed to undergo sufficient CSR and proliferation. Taken together, our findings show that expression of NUP98-HOXD13 impairs CSR and reduces the antibody-mediated immune response, in addition to its role in leukemia. Further delineation of the NUP98-HOXD13 transgene may reveal novel pathways involved in CSR.","['Puthiyaveetil, Abdul Gafoor', 'Heid, Bettina', 'Reilly, Christopher M', 'HogenEsch, Harm', 'Caudell, David L']","['Puthiyaveetil AG', 'Heid B', 'Reilly CM', 'HogenEsch H', 'Caudell DL']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00177-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Aug;40(8):622-33. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.002.

Present evidence indicates that this factor might play an important role in leukemia cells as well. The aim of this study is to present a model of SDF-1-induced mobilization using leukemia cell lines. CXCR4 expression was compared in Kasumi-1, Jurkat, HL-60, KG-1a, and K562 cells by flow cytometry and Western blot. Migration was analyzed with Transwell assays, and adhesive cell-cell interaction was quantified with a standardized adhesion assay and flow cytometry. CXCR4 was expressed by all leukemic cell lines analyzed, although surface expression of this receptor was found in Kasumi-1 and Jurkat cells only. Correspondingly, SDF-1alpha effects on migration and cell-cell adhesion were observed in Kasumi-1 and Jurkat cells only, and this could be blocked by AMD3100 in a reversible manner. We have provided evidence that SDF-1alpha acts as a chemotactic and chemokinetic agent. In addition, surface expression of integrin-beta2, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and N-cadherin decreased after stimulation with SDF-1alpha. SDF-1alpha affects cell-cell adhesion and migration only in leukemia cells on which the CXCR4 receptor is present on the surface. An SDF-1 gradient is not necessarily required to induce migration, as chemokinesis can also occur. Upon stimulation with SDF-1, CXCR4 promotes modifications on the surface pattern of adhesion molecules, which have an influence on adhesion and migration.","['Zepeda-Moreno, Abraham', 'Saffrich, Rainer', 'Walenda, Thomas', 'Hoang, Van T', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Sanchez-Enriquez, Sergio', 'Corona-Rivera, Alfredo', 'Wagner, Wolfgang', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Zepeda-Moreno A', 'Saffrich R', 'Walenda T', 'Hoang VT', 'Wuchter P', 'Sanchez-Enriquez S', 'Corona-Rivera A', 'Wagner W', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany. science.azm@peloscorp.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00176-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Aug;40(8):666-74. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.05.001.

In this study, the molecular mechanism of INO-A-induced cell death was investigated in Jurkat T lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Assessment of phosphatidylserine exposure confirmed apoptosis as the primary mode of cell death in INO-A-treated Jurkat cells. INO-A treatment for only 30 min resulted in a significant increase of tail moment which suggests that DNA damage is an early apoptotic signal. Further flow cytometric assessment of the superoxide anion level confirmed that INO-A induced DNA damage was mediated with a concomitant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Investigation on the thiols revealed an early decrease of free thiols in 30 min after 50 muM INO-A treatment. Using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, a potentiometric dye, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) was observed in INO-A-treated cells as early as 30 min. The INO-A-induced apoptosis progressed with the simultaneous activation of caspases-2 and -9 which then led to the processing of caspase-3. Taken together, these data demonstrate that INO-A induced early oxidative stress, DNA damage and loss of MMP which subsequently led to the activation of an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in Jurkat cells.","['Chan, Kok Meng', 'Hamzah, Ruhana', 'Rahaman, Amira Abd', 'Jong, Vivien Yi Mian', 'Khong, Heng Yen', 'Rajab, Nor Fadilah', 'Ee, Gwendoline Cheng Lian', 'Inayat-Hussain, Salmaan Hussain']","['Chan KM', 'Hamzah R', 'Rahaman AA', 'Jong VY', 'Khong HY', 'Rajab NF', 'Ee GC', 'Inayat-Hussain SH']","['Toxicology Laboratory, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia. chan@fskb.ukm.my']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00359-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.04.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2012 Aug;50(8):2916-22. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.04.048.

An alcoholic extract of L. serratum (LSE) was investigated for its ability to induce apoptosis in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with various concentrations of LSE (6-100 mug/mL) resulted in a sequence of events characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of cell viability, morphological changes, and increased sub-G(1) DNA content. Serratenediol (SE), a known biologically active agent, was isolated from MC fraction of LSE and was able to demonstrate significant and dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects on HL-60 cells. Similar to the effects observed with the crude LSE, the SE-related effects included the formation of apoptotic bodies and fragmented DNA, as well as the accumulation of DNA in the sub-G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Analysis of the mechanism of these events indicated that SE treated cells had an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL, released the cytochrome c, activated caspase-9, -3, and cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP); these observations are hallmarks of apoptotic events. Thus, the results suggest that SE can induce apoptosis via regulating the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL in HL-60 cell lines.","['Ham, Young-Min', 'Yoon, Weon-Jong', 'Park, Soo-Yeong', 'Jung, Yong-Hwan', 'Kim, Daekyung', 'Jeon, You-Jin', 'Wijesinghe, W A J P', 'Kang, Sung-Myung', 'Kim, Kil-Nam']","['Ham YM', 'Yoon WJ', 'Park SY', 'Jung YH', 'Kim D', 'Jeon YJ', 'Wijesinghe WA', 'Kang SM', 'Kim KN']","['Jeju Biodiversity Research Institute, Jeju Technopark, Jeju 699-943, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2011/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00362-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2012 Aug;50(8):2629-34. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.019.

Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed expression of 2 myoepithelial differentiation markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD10), in mammary parenchymal tissue from intact (INT) and ovariectomized (OVX) heifers. On d 40, Holstein heifers underwent either an ovariectomy (OVX; n=16) or a sham (INT; n=21) operation. At 55, 70, 85, 100, 130, and 160 d of age, tissues were collected, and multispectral imaging was used to quantify immunofluorescent staining for myoepithelial cell (MC) markers. Fluorescent intensity (FI) of the markers was normalized against a control sample. In the basal epithelial layer, CD10 FI was less and SMA FI was greater in OVX than INT. The ratio of SMA to CD10 FI, as a proxy indicator for MC differentiation, was greater in tissue from OVX compared with INT heifers after 55 d of age. The staining for SMA was frequently more intense along the basal aspect of cells, whereas CD10 expression was localized on the apical surface of the MC. In mammary tissue from both INT and OVX heifers, we observed basal cells that were negative for both CD10 and SMA, some of which appeared to span the distance from basement membrane to the ductal lumen. Interestingly, we also observed CD10+ cells adjacent to the ductal lumen, a situation that was more prevalent in OVX than in INT heifers. Also, ovariectomy affects MC expression of both SMA and CD10, as well as the pattern of MC development. Myoepithelial cells are known to limit parenchymal growth in other species.

These substances reduce relapse rates, side-effects are tolerated by most patients and - after more than 15 years of experience - the long-term safety profile for these drugs can be appraised as very good. In 2006, the therapeutic tool kit was augmented by the first monoclonal antibody, natalizumab, approved as monotherapy for treatment-refractory highly active MS. The restriction to these patient groups results from the rare, but fatal risk of JC virus-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The first oral agent (fingolimod) was approved in 2010 for the United States and in 2011 for Europe. As a further option for therapy escalation the chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone is approved for non-responding relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The use of mitoxantrone is limited by severe cardiotoxicity and the risk of treatment related acute leukemia. However, despite the fact that therapeutic options for MS have significantly been widened over the past decade new treatment options and more convenient modes of application are needed to enhance efficacy and improve adherence to therapy. This article will review recent developments in MS treatments focusing on oral agents (cladribine, fingolimod, BG00012, teriflunomide and laquinimod) and novel monoclonal antibodies (alemtumzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab).","['Meuth, Sven G', 'Gobel, Kerstin', 'Wiendl, Heinz']","['Meuth SG', 'Gobel K', 'Wiendl H']","['University of Munster, Department of Neurology - Inflammatory disorders of the nervous system and neurooncology, Domagkstrasse 13, 48149 Munster, Germany. sven.meuth@ukmuenster']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120516-8 [pii]', '10.2174/138161212802502198 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(29):4489-97. doi: 10.2174/138161212802502198.,20130206,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Approval', '*Drug Design', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Medication Adherence', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic alterations of ALK are associated with a number of cancers, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Standard therapies for these diseases include surgery plus unspecific cytotoxic agents, with a low therapeutic window and significant treatment-associated systemic toxicity. A few small-molecule inhibitors of ALK kinase activity have been described in the recent years, some of which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. AREAS COVERED: Literature was searched for all ALK inhibitors that have entered clinical investigation, including published research articles and meeting abstracts. Data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of crizotinib, as well as preliminary clinical data for second-generation compounds, are reviewed. The issue of drug resistance is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Understanding the specific genetic aberration that causes cancer development and progression allows major advances in cancer therapy. Along the same way shown by imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia, compounds that selectively target ALK are bringing a revolution in the treatment of ALK-positive tumors. Crizotinib has just been approved, and new more potent ALK inhibitors will shortly follow. These molecules represent another excellent proof-of-principle for targeted therapy.","['Mologni, Luca']",['Mologni L'],"['University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. luca.mologni@unimib.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120522,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.690031 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jul;21(7):985-94. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.690031.

We experienced a case involving a 68-year-old Japanese male patient who had been followed-up for four years with a diagnosis of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis/primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and noticed a painful mass in his left axilla. A wedge biopsy characterized the lesion as MyS that displayed megakaryoblastic/megakaryocytic differentiation. As his complete blood count included a few myeloid blasts (1% of WBC) and a bone marrow biopsy detected fibrosis without evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a diagnosis of extramedullary blastic transformation of PMF was made, which was confirmed later by V617F mutation in Janus kinase-2 in both initial bone marrow biopsy and axillary tumor biopsy specimens. The patient died of pneumonia eight months after developing the axillary tumor. At autopsy, multiple MyS masses were detected in his soft tissue, but his bone marrow only contained fibrosis. Although MyS rarely develops before the leukemic transformation of PMF, no evidence of AML could be found in the patient's bone marrow at any point during the course of his disease. Thus, it is possible that the blasts in his peripheral blood were derived from the remaining MyS. Furthermore, the present case indicates that extramedullary blastic transformation, which is occasionally seen in CML, can also occur in PMF. Therefore, it is important to recognize that there is a wide variation in the pathogeneses of MyS and PMF.","['Morita, Kohei', 'Nakamine, Hirokazu', 'Inoue, Reina', 'Takano, Masato', 'Takeda, Maiko', 'Enomoto, Yasunori', 'Kasai, Takahiko', 'Nonomura, Akitaka', 'Tanaka, Haruyuki', 'Amano, Itsuto', 'Morii, Takeshi', 'Kimura, Hiroshi']","['Morita K', 'Nakamine H', 'Inoue R', 'Takano M', 'Takeda M', 'Enomoto Y', 'Kasai T', 'Nonomura A', 'Tanaka H', 'Amano I', 'Morii T', 'Kimura H']","['Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan. moritak@naramed-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120328,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.2012.02813.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2012 Jun;62(6):433-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2012.02813.x.

This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, and clinical activity and toxicity, as well as the emerging role of TKIs in lymphoid malignancies, allergic diseases, and autoimmune disorders. AREAS COVERED: A literature review was conducted of the MEDLINE database PubMed for articles in English. Publications from 2000 through January 2012 were scrutinized. The search terms used were Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors, PCI-32765, GDC-0834, LFM-A13, AVL-101, AVL-292, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors, R343, R406, R112, R788, fostamatinib, BAY-61-3606, C-61, piceatannol, Lyn, imatinib, nilotinib, bafetinib, dasatinib, GDC-0834, PP2, SU6656 in conjunction with lymphoid malignancy, NHL, CLL, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. EXPERT OPINION: The use of TKIs, especially inhibitors of Btk, Syk, and Lyn, is a promising new strategy for targeted treatment of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune disorders and allergic diseases. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of TKIs in the treatment of these disorders.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Robak, Ewa']","['Robak T', 'Robak E']","['Medical University of Lodz, Department of Hematology, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120522,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/23 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.685650 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jul;21(7):921-47. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.685650.

However, there is little information on the possible correlation of eye problems with systemic diseases such as heart defect (with or without surgery), hypotony, hypothyroidism, hearing loss, and others. METHODS: Ophthalmic problems versus certain systemic diseases were studied in 65 children with DS, aged 2 months to 13 years, referred to the University Eye Hospital Ljubljana, Slovenia from 2008 to 2010. Standard ophthalmic examination methods were used, and physical data were taken from pediatric records. RESULTS: Ocular findings included nystagmus (29.2%), esotropia (26.1%), epiphora (21.5%), Brushfield spots (16.9%), lens opacities (12.3%), abnormalities of the retinal vessels, foveal hypoplasia, or retinal pigment epithelium hyperplasia (32.2%), and optic disc pallor (7.6%). Hyperopia (36.9%) was the most frequent refractive error in the group, followed by astigmatism (29.2%) and myopia (24.6%). No diagnosed systemic abnormalities were found in 18.3% of the children, while 30.7% had congenital heart defect. Hypothyroidism, hypotony, hearing loss, gastrointestinal tract malformations, and leukemia were less common. Nystagmus was related to myopia and esotropia, and to heart disease and heart operations.

Although inhibiting BCR-Abl activity with imatinib shows great clinical success, many patients acquire secondary mutations that result in resistance to imatinib. Second-generation inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib can overcome the majority of these mutations but fail to treat patients with an especially prevalent T315I mutation at the gatekeeper position of the kinase domain. However, a combination of nilotinib with an allosteric type IV inhibitor was recently shown to overcome this clinically relevant point mutation. In this study, we present the development of a direct binding assay that enables the straightforward detection of allosteric inhibitors which bind within the myristate pocket of Abl.

Diosgenin is one of the components of SLE. Our study showed that SLE and diosgenin decreased the viable WEHI-3 cells and induced G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and apoptosis in concentration- or time-dependent manners. Both reagents increased the levels of ROS production and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). SLE- and diosgenin-triggered apoptosis is mediated through modulating the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. Intriguingly, the p53 inhibitor (pifithrin-alpha), anti-Fas ligand (FasL) mAb, and specific inhibitors of caspase-8 (z-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 (z-LEHD-fmk), and caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) blocked SLE- and diosgenin-reduced cell viability of WEHI-3 cells. The in vivo study demonstrated that SLE has marked antitumor efficacy against tumors in the WEHI-3 cell allograft model. In conclusion, SLE- and diosgenin-induced G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and triggered extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways via p53 activation in WEHI-3 cells. SLE also exhibited antitumor activity in vivo.

In this study, we explore the mechanism for clonal contraction through following the time- and division-influenced expression of several pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins within CFSE-labeled cultures. Several findings, involving both human and mouse B cells, show that a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway involving p53 contributes to the high activation-induced cell death (AICD) susceptibility of replicating blasts. Activated B cell clones exhibit elevated p53 protein and elevated mRNA/protein of proapoptotic molecules known to be under direct p53 transcriptional control, Bax, Bad, Puma, Bid, and procaspase 6, accompanied by reduced anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Under these conditions, Bim levels were not increased. The finding that full-length Bid protein significantly declines in AICD-susceptible replicating blasts, whereas Bid mRNA does not, suggests that Bid is actively cleaved to short-lived, proapoptotic truncated Bid. AICD was diminished, albeit not eliminated, by p53 small interfering RNA transfection, genetic deletion of p53, or Bcl-2 overexpression. DNA damage is a likely trigger for p53-dependent AICD because susceptible lymphoblasts expressed significantly elevated levels of both phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated-Ser(1980) and phospho-H2AX-Ser(139). Deficiency in activation-induced cytosine deaminase diminishes but does not ablate murine B cell AICD, indicating that activation-induced cytosine deaminase-induced DNA damage is only in part responsible. Evidence for p53-influenced AICD during this route of T cell-independent clonal expansion raises the possibility that progeny bearing p53 mutations might undergo positive selection in peripherally inflamed tissues with elevated levels of IL-4 and BAFF.","['Lee, Hyunjoo', 'Haque, Shabirul', 'Nieto, Jennifer', 'Trott, Joshua', 'Inman, John K', 'McCormick, Steven', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Mongini, Patricia K A']","['Lee H', 'Haque S', 'Nieto J', 'Trott J', 'Inman JK', 'McCormick S', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Mongini PK']","['Laboratory of B Cell Biology, Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC3370112,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1103037 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1103037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jun 15;188(12):6093-108. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103037.

Elacridar is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein and has been used to examine the influence of these efflux transporters on drug distribution to brain. Friend leukemia virus strain B mice were administered 100 mg/kg elacridar either orally or intraperitoneally. The absolute bioavailability of elacridar after oral or intraperitoneal dosing was determined with respect to an intravenous dose of 2.5 mg/kg. At these doses, the absolute bioavailability was 0.22 for oral administration and 0.01 for intraperitoneal administration. The terminal half-life of elacridar was approximately 4 h after intraperitoneal and intravenous administration and nearly 20 h after oral dosing. The brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp,brain) of elacridar increased as plasma exposure increased, suggesting saturation of the efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier. The Kp,brain after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral dosing was 0.82, 0.43, and 4.31, respectively. The low aqueous solubility and high lipophilicity of elacridar result in poor oral absorption, most likely dissolution-rate-limited. These results illustrate the importance of the route of administration and the resultant plasma exposure in achieving effective plasma and brain concentrations of elacridar and can be used as a guide for future studies involving elacridar administration and in developing formulation strategies to overcome the poor absorption.","['Sane, Ramola', 'Agarwal, Sagar', 'Elmquist, William F']","['Sane R', 'Agarwal S', 'Elmquist WF']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Brain Barriers Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,PMC3400790,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.112.045930 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.112.045930 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2012 Aug;40(8):1612-9. doi: 10.1124/dmd.112.045930.

By transferring into T cells the genes encoding antigen-specific receptors, the functional activity of large populations of T cells can be redirected against defined targets including virally infected or cancer cells. The potential of therapeutic T cells to traffic to sites of disease, to expand and to persist after a single treatment remains a major advantage over the currently available immunotherapies that use monoclonal antibodies. Here we review recent progress in the field of TCR gene therapy, outlining challenges to its successful implementation and the strategies being used to overcome them. We detail strategies used in the optimization of affinity and surface expression of the introduced TCR, the choice of T cell subpopulations for gene transfer, and the promotion of persistence of gene-modified T cells in vivo. We review the safety concerns surrounding the use of gene-modified T cells in patients, discussing emerging solutions to these problems, and describe the increasingly positive results from the use of gene-modified T cells in recent clinical trials of adoptive cellular immunotherapy. The increasing sophistication of measures to ensure the safety of engineered T cells is accompanied by an increasing number of clinical trials: these will be essential to guide the effective translation of cellular immunotherapy from the laboratory to the bedside.","['Uttenthal, Benjamin J', 'Chua, Ignatius', 'Morris, Emma C', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Uttenthal BJ', 'Chua I', 'Morris EC', 'Stauss HJ']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Immunity, Infection and Transplantation, University College London (UCL), Royal Free Hospital, London, UK. b.uttenthal@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['G0701311/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900950/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.2637 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2012 Jun;14(6):386-99. doi: 10.1002/jgm.2637.,20121221,10.1002/jgm.2637 [doi],,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,['J Gene Med. 2012 Jun;14(6):384-5.

PROCEDURE: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE was carried out in France in 2003-2004. Population controls were frequency matched with cases on age and gender. Data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: In all, 764 cases of AL (648 lymphoblastic AL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) and 101 myeloblastic AL) and 1,681 controls were included. The AL cases' mothers reported congenital malformations more frequently than the controls' mothers (OR = 1.5 [1.0-2.4]). ALL was significantly associated with the use of fertility treatment for the index pregnancy (OR = 1.9 [1.3-2.8]). In particular, ALL was associated with ovulation induction only (OR = 2.6 [1.6-4.3]), but not with in vitro fertilization (IVF, OR = 1.0 [0.4-2.3]) or artificial insemination (OR = 1.3 [0.5-3.9]). A positive association was also observed for the difficulty of becoming pregnant without fertility treatment (OR = 1.5 [1.0-2.1]). AL was positively associated with a history of voluntary abortion (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.8]) but not with a history of spontaneous (OR = 0.8 [0.7-1.0]) or therapeutic (OR = 0.7 [0.5-1.1]) abortion. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that subfertility in itself and ovulation induction may be associated with ALL, and support a positive association with congenital malformations.

Patients were stratified into four risk groups (S1, S2, S3, and S4) and the treatment consisted of intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, if indicated. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were recruited and median age at diagnosis of ALL was 4.6 (range, 0.3-17) years. The median time from initial diagnosis to relapse was 2.5 (range, 0.3-9.1) years and follow-up time was 2.7 (range, 0-9.9) years. Forty-nine patients (87.5%) achieved second complete remission (CR2).

Achievements of these optimal responses have not, however, been comprehensively tested as response-related prognostic factors using single center data sets. We evaluated the parameters using long-term (median 63 months) outcomes from 363 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib as frontline therapy at our center. Intention-to-treat analysis showed comparable rates of complete cytogenetic response (86 %), major molecular response (MMR, 54 %), and complete molecular response (MR(4.5), 8 %). Estimated overall survival, progression-free survival, and event-free survival at 7 years were 94, 88 and 84 %, respectively. Achievement of recommended optimal response at 6 months (major cytogenetic response) and 12 months (complete cytogenetic response) yielded significantly better overall, progression-free, and event-free survival. However, achievement of recommended optimal response at 18 months (MMR) provided marginal benefit only in event-free survival. Most ELN criteria were predictive of long-term outcomes, with the exception of the clinical significance of achieving MMR at 18 months. Treatment adherence in the early treatment period was one of the important independent predictors of favorable long-term outcome.

We performed miRNA expression profile in six Chinese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and in peripheral B cells from pooled 30 healthy donors, using a platform containing 866 human miRNAs. The most frequent changes in miRNAs in CLL cells included downregulation of miR-126, miR-572, miR-494, miR-923, miR-638, miR-130a, miR-181a and miR-181b and up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-660, miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-142-5p, miR-101, miR-30b, miR-34a, miR-let-7f, miR-21 and miR-155. Among the miRNAs down-regulated in CLL cells, we showed that miR-181a/b expression levels were significantly lower in poor prognostic subgroups defined by unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable status and p53 aberrations. Furthermore, under-expression of miR-181a and miR-181b was associated with shorter overall survival and treatment-free survival in CLL patients. We further evaluated fludarabine-induced apoptosis after transfection of primary CLL cells from 40 patients with miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-34a, miR-181a and miR-181b mimics. Transfection of miR-34a, miR-181a and miR-181b mimics into CLL cells from p53 wild-type patients led to significant increase in apoptosis compared with miRNA control. However, enforced expression of these miRNAs had no effect on B-CLL cells from p53-attenuated patients. We further demonstrated that miR-181a and miR-181b inhibiting BCL-2, MCL-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein by direct binding to 3'UTR. Thus, these results suggest that miR-181a/b may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CLL and may provide a possible therapeutic avenue and a sensitive indicator of the activity of the p53 axis in CLL.","['Zhu, Dan-Xia', 'Zhu, Wei', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Fan, Lei', 'Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Wang, Yin-Hua', 'Liu, Ping', 'Hong, Min', 'Miao, Kou-Rong', 'Liu, Peng', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Zhu DX', 'Zhu W', 'Fang C', 'Fan L', 'Zou ZJ', 'Wang YH', 'Liu P', 'Hong M', 'Miao KR', 'Liu P', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs179 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs179 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 Jul;33(7):1294-301. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs179.

In this study, we constructed the CHMP5 single chain variable fragment antibody (CHMP5-scFv) retrovirus and studied the changes of programmed cell death (PCD) of AML leukemic cells after infection by the retrovirus. METHODS: The anti-CHMP5 KC14 hybridoma cell line was constructed to generate monoclonal antibody of CHMP5. The protein expression of CHMP5 was studied using immunofluorescence analysis. pMIG-CHMP5 scFv antibody expressible retroviral vector was constructed to prepare CHMP5-scFv retrovirus. AML leukemic U937 cells were infected with the retrovirus, and programmed cell death was studied using confocal microscope, FCM and Western blot. RESULTS: We obtained a monoclonal antibody of CHMP5, and found the expression of CHMP5 was up-regulated in the leukemic cells. After U937 cells were infected with CHMP5-scFv retrovirus, CHMP5 protein was neutralized. Moreover, the infection resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis and necrosis of U937 cells. In U937 cells infected with CHMP5-scFv retrovirus, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-mediated caspase-independent necrotic PCD was activated, but autophagic programmed cell death was not observed. Neither the intrinsic nor extrinsic apoptotic PCD pathway was activated. The granzyme B/perforin-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic PCD pathway was not activated. CONCLUSION: CHMP5-scFv retrovirus can neutralize the abnormally high levels of the CHMP5 protein in the cytosol of AML leukemic U937 cells, thereby inducing the programmed cell death of the leukemic cells via AIF-mediated caspase-independent necrosis and apoptosis.","['Wang, Hai-rong', 'Xiao, Zhen-yu', 'Chen, Miao', 'Wang, Fei-long', 'Liu, Jia', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Zhong, Ji-hua', 'Ou-Yang, Ren-rong', 'Shen, Yan-lin', 'Pan, Shu-ming']","['Wang HR', 'Xiao ZY', 'Chen M', 'Wang FL', 'Liu J', 'Zhong H', 'Zhong JH', 'Ou-Yang RR', 'Shen YL', 'Pan SM']","['Emergency Department, Xin-Hua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,PMC4010379,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201238 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2012.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2012 Jun;33(6):809-16. doi: 10.1038/aps.2012.38.

Doxorubicin, menadione and adaphostin produced different effects on these cell lines. Rapid doxorubicin-induced cell death in Jurkat cells was mediated by caspase activation. Doxorubicin-induced cell death of HLTCs was delayed due to the absence of caspase-3 and -8 expression. Delayed HLTC cell death was mediated and triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Other drugs containing quinone groups, such as menadione and adaphostin, were also tested on HLTC and both were toxic by a caspase-independent mechanism. The toxicity of these drugs correlated with the generation of the superoxide anion, which increased and was more effective in HLTCs than in parental Jurkat cells. Accordingly, SOD1 activity was much lower in HLTCs than in Jurkat cells. This lower SOD1 activity in HLTCs was associated not only with the absence of the wild-type (16 kDa) SOD1 monomer but also with the presence of a shortened (14 kDa) SOD1 monomer isoform. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of drugs containing the quinone group was prevented by incubation with manganese(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic and a potent inhibitor of oxidation. These findings could explain the sensitivity of HLTCs to drugs containing the quinone group using a mechanism dependent on oxidative stress. These observations can also be useful to target hyperproliferative leukemias that are resistant to the classical caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.","['Aguilo, Juan Ignacio', 'Iturralde, Maria', 'Monleon, Inmaculada', 'Inarrea, Pedro', 'Pardo, Julian', 'Martinez-Lorenzo, Maria Jose', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Alava, Maria Angeles']","['Aguilo JI', 'Iturralde M', 'Monleon I', 'Inarrea P', 'Pardo J', 'Martinez-Lorenzo MJ', 'Anel A', 'Alava MA']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(12)00080-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2012.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Jun 25;198(1-3):18-28. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2012.05.001.

However, since ABT-737 binds to Mcl-1 with low affinity, ABT-737-mediated apoptosis signaling is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and other solid cancer cells due to the elevated expression of Mcl-1. Accordingly, strategies that target Mcl-1 are explored for overcoming ABT-737-resistance. In this study, we reported that Norcantharidin (NCTD), a small-molecule anticancer drug derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle (Mylabris), induced transcriptional repression of Mcl-1 and considerably enhanced ABT-737-triggered cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in multiple HCC cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the enhancement of ABT-737-mediated apoptosis by NCTD was associated with activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, which involved cytosolic release of cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, knockdown of Bax/Bak, the key effectors permeabilizing mitochondrial outer membrane significantly attenuated the enhancement, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway played an essential role in the execution of the apoptosis. Finally, knockdown of Mcl-1 substantially potentiated ABT-737-mediated apoptotic cell death, confirming the potency of Mcl-1 repression by NCTD in enhancing ABT-737-induced apoptosis. These results therefore suggest that combination treatment with NCTD can overcome ABT-737 resistance and enhance ABT-737 therapeutic efficacy in treating human HCC.","['Zhang, Shuijun', 'Li, Gongquan', 'Ma, Xiuxian', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Guangzhi', 'Feng, Liushun', 'Zhao, Yongfu', 'Zhang, Gong', 'Wu, Yang', 'Ye, Xuexiang', 'Qin, Baoming', 'Lu, Jianfeng']","['Zhang S', 'Li G', 'Ma X', 'Wang Y', 'Liu G', 'Feng L', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang G', 'Wu Y', 'Ye X', 'Qin B', 'Lu J']","['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China. zhangshuijun@zzu.edu.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,,2012/05/23 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00146-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Sep;24(9):1803-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.05.009.

The exact parameters that determine these outcomes are unknown but are believed to include host genetic factors that control the immune response to infection. Host response to fellow retroviridae member HIV is influenced by the expression of members of the Killer Immunoglobulin Receptor (KIR) family including KIR3DS1. In this study we examined the association of KIR3DS1 with the outcome of HTLV-1 infection in three geographically distinct cohorts (Jamaican, Japanese and Brazilian). Despite increased prevalence of KIR3DS1 in the HAM/TSP patients of the Jamaican cohort, we found no evidence for a role of KIR3DS1 in influencing control of proviral load or disease outcome. This suggests that unlike HIV, KIR3DS1-mediated regulation of HTLV-1 infection does not occur, or is ineffective.","[""O'Connor, Geraldine M"", 'Seich Al Basatena, Nafisa-Katrin', 'Olavarria, Viviana', 'MacNamara, Aidan', 'Vine, Alison', 'Ying, Qi', 'Hisada, Michie', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Asquith, Becca', 'McVicar, Daniel W']","[""O'Connor GM"", 'Seich Al Basatena NK', 'Olavarria V', 'MacNamara A', 'Vine A', 'Ying Q', 'Hisada M', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Asquith B', 'McVicar DW']","['Cancer and Inflammation Program, Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. oconnorg@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['G0601072/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J007439/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'ZIA BC010747-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,PMC3402611,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0198-8859(12)00120-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humimm.2012.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2012 Aug;73(8):783-7. doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2012.05.006.

METHODS: The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether cultured Burkitt lymphoma cells undergo apoptosis when treated with baicalin. Growth rates were measured using MTT and colony formation assays, and induction of apoptosis was quantified using Annexin V and DNA fragmentation assays. Mechanisms underlying observed growth suppression were examined using Western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment of CA46 Burkitt lymphoma cells with baicalin for 48 h markedly decreased the rate of cell proliferation; an IC50 value of 10 muM was obtained. Colony formation was almost fully suppressed at 10 muM baicalin. CA46 cells underwent apoptosis in response to baicalin treatment as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of cells stainable with Annexin V, by increased DNA fragmentation, and by activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway for cell death as characterized by increased expression of the cleaved forms of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Additionally, baicalin was found to down-regulate anti-apoptotic and up-regulate apoptotic components of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations at which baicalin altered expression of components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in CA46 cells were comparable to those that suppressed growth and induced apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that the observed growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing actions of baicalin in these cells are mediated by down-regulation of this pathway.","['Huang, Yi', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Li, Jing', 'Wei, Tiannan', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Chen, Yingyu']","['Huang Y', 'Hu J', 'Zheng J', 'Li J', 'Wei T', 'Zheng Z', 'Chen Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350000 Fujian, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120520,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC3403945,2012/05/23 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-31-48 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-31-48 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2012 May 20;31:48. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-31-48.,20130227,10.1186/1756-9966-31-48 [doi],,,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, alterations in metabolism-associated factors, particularly intra- and extracellular proteases were investigated. A measurement of telomerase activity in the leukemic cells revealed continuously decreasing telomere adducts within 72 h of TPA treatment in pMTH1-U937 cells. In contrast, telomerase activity sustained in asCD11b-U937 upon TPA-induced differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed unchanged CD11b levels in TPA-induced asCD11b-U937 in contrast to elevated levels in pMTH1-U937 whereby the expression of other beta2-integrins including CD11a, CD11c and CD18 was increased in both populations after TPA treatment. Moreover, adherent pMTH1-U937 demonstrated the expression of monocytic differentiation markers including F4-80 and CD14 and an increased MIP-1alpha production which remained at low or undetectable in TPA-induced asCD11b-U937. These effects indicated an altered response of the different cell populations to the TPA-induced differentiation process. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed differences in the expression levels of intracellular metabolic factors including MnSOD and p97/VCP and after measurement of 20 S proteasomal proteolytic activity. In addition, increased levels of extracellular metabolic factors including the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, MMP-7 and MMP-9 were observed in pMTH1-U937 cells in contrast to unaltered levels in asCD11b-U937 cells.","['Mandel, Katharina', 'Otte, Anna', 'Hass, Ralf']","['Mandel K', 'Otte A', 'Hass R']","['Biochemistry and Tumor Biology Lab, Gynecology Research Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University, Hannover, Germany. hass.ralf@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120711,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,PMC3394204,2012/05/23 06:00,2012/05/23 06:01,['2012/05/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['1478-811X-10-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-10-13 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2012 Jul 11;10(1):13. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-10-13.,20121002,10.1186/1478-811X-10-13 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many AA patients, these features are thought to result from an oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic T-cells that destroy haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. This notion is supported by the observation that AA patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy. A fraction of MDS patients also respond well to immunosuppressive therapy suggesting a similar role for cytotoxic T-cells in the etiology of MDS, however the role of cytotoxic T-cells in MDS remains unclear. Mice that express a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgene develop a MDS that closely mimics the human condition in terms of dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We followed a cohort of NHD13 mice lacking the Rag1 protein (NHD13/Rag1KO) to determine if the absence of lymphocytes might 1) delay the onset and/or diminish the severity of the MDS, or 2) effect malignant transformation and survival of the NHD13 mice. No difference was seen in the onset or severity of MDS between the NHD13 and NHD13/Rag1KO mice. However, NHD13/Rag1KO mice had decreased survival and showed a trend toward increased incidence of transformation to AML compared to the NHD13 mice, suggesting protection from AML transformation by a modest immuno-surveillance effect. In the absence of functional Tcrb signaling in the NHD13/Rag1KO T-cell tumors, Pak7 was identified as a potential Tcrb surrogate survival signal.","['Gough, Sheryl M', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Gough SM', 'Chung YJ', 'Aplan PD']","['Leukemia Biology Section, Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120511,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3350481,2012/05/19 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036876 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-02592 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36876. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036876.

After 48 h of incubation, we observed that the acetate: methanol (95:5), acetate, and chloroform fractions, as well as the catuabine B, increased in the number of cells in early apoptosis, from 53.0 to 74.8%. An analysis of the potential of the mitochondrial membrane by incorporation of JC-1 showed that most cells during incubation of the acetate: methanol (95:5) and acetate fractions (63.85 and 59.2%) were stained, suggesting the involvement of an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.","['Aguiar, Jaciana S', 'Araujo, Rosilma O', 'Rodrigues, Maria do Desterro', 'Sena, Kesia X F R', 'Batista, Andre M', 'Guerra, Maria M P', 'Oliveira, Steno L', 'Tavares, Josean F', 'Silva, Marcelo S', 'Nascimento, Silene C', 'da Silva, Teresinha Goncalves']","['Aguiar JS', 'Araujo RO', 'Rodrigues Mdo D', 'Sena KX', 'Batista AM', 'Guerra MM', 'Oliveira SL', 'Tavares JF', 'Silva MS', 'Nascimento SC', 'da Silva TG']","['Antibiotics of Departament, Federal University of Pernambuco, 50670-901, Recife, PE, Brasil; E-Mails: jacianaaguiar@gmail.com (J.S.A.); rosilma23@hotmail.com (R.O.A.); mdrodrigues@yahoo.com.br (M.D.R.); kxfrs@bol.com.br (K.X.F.R.S.); silenen@yahoo.com.br (S.C.N.).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120329,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC3344205,2012/05/19 06:00,2012/05/19 06:01,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijms13044124 [doi]', 'ijms-13-04124 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012;13(4):4124-40. doi: 10.3390/ijms13044124.

Mastocytes (cells having secretory granules containing cytokines, vasoactive amine, and proteases) play a pivotal role in the immune and inflammatory responses against exogenous toxins. Mastocytes are also recruited in the tumor stroma and are involved in tumor vascularization and growth. AIM AND METHODS: In this work, mastocyte-like rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were used to investigate whether carboxyl-modified 30 nm polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs) and naked mesoporous silica (MPS) 10 nm NPs are able to label the secretory inflammatory granules, and possibly induce exocytosis of these granules. Uptake, cellular retention and localization of fluorescent NPs were analyzed by cytofluorometry and microscope imaging. RESULTS: OUR FINDINGS WERE THAT: (1) secretory granules of mastocytes are accessible by NPs via endocytosis; (2) PS and MPS silica NPs label two distinct subpopulations of inflammatory granules in RBL mastocytes; and (3) PS NPs induce calcium-dependent exocytosis of inflammatory granules. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the value of NPs for live imaging of inflammatory processes, and also have important implications for the clinical use of PS-based NPs, due to their potential to trigger the unwanted activation of mastocytes.","['Ekkapongpisit, Maneerat', 'Giovia, Antonino', 'Nicotra, Giuseppina', 'Ozzano, Matteo', 'Caputo, Giuseppe', 'Isidoro, Ciro']","['Ekkapongpisit M', 'Giovia A', 'Nicotra G', 'Ozzano M', 'Caputo G', 'Isidoro C']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology and Nanobioimaging, Department of Health Sciences, Universita del Piemonte Orientale A.

Neuroimaging revealed an acute anterior left middle cerebral artery infarct with parenchymal haemorrhagic conversion, mass effect and subfalcine herniation. He subsequently underwent left frontal craniotomy and evacuation of large frontal haematoma and decompressive craniectomy for cerebral oedema. Six months postoperatively he underwent titanium cranioplasty. He had made good clinical recovery and is currently mobilising independently with mild occasional episodes of expressive dysphasia, difficulty with fine motor movement on the right side, and has remained seizure free. This is the first documented case of L-asparaginase induced haemorrhagic stroke managed by neurosurgical intervention.

METHODS: The authors conducted a multivariate analysis of overall survival, event-free survival, and complete remission duration, including numeric variation (single vs multiple) and quantitative mutant burden of FLT3-ITD as variables among other clinically relevant factors. RESULTS: An analysis of a cohort of 1043 patients with AML demonstrated that, among patients with normal-karyotype acute myelogenous leukemia and FLT3-ITD mutation, overall survival and event-free survival were not affected by the number of FLT3-ITD mutations, but complete remission duration was significantly longer in patients who had multiple FLT3-ITD mutations (median, 86 weeks vs 34 weeks; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that time-to-event analyses of patients with normal-karyotype acute myelogenous leukemia and FLT3-ITD mutation should take into account the number of mutations and the mutant burden, among other factors.","['Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Luthra, Raja', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Borthakur G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Patel KP', 'Ravandi F', 'Qiao W', 'Faderl S', 'Kadia T', 'Luthra R', 'Pierce S', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. gborthak@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20120517,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC4184417,2012/05/19 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27571 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Dec 1;118(23):5819-22. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27571.

About one-fourth of empirically defined human promoters are surrounded by or contain clustered repetitive elements. It was previously observed that a sharp transition of methylation exists between highly methylated repetitive elements and unmethylated promoter-CGIs in normal tissues. The factors that lead to aberrant CGI hypermethylation in cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we established a site-specific integration system with enforced local transcriptional repression in colorectal cancer cells and monitored the occurrence of initial de novo methylation at specific CG sites adjacent to the CGI of the INSL6 promoter, which could be accelerated by binding a KRAB-containing transcriptional factor. Additional repetitive elements from P16 and RIL (PDLIM4), if situated adjacent to the promoter of INSL6, could confer DNA methylation spreading into the CGI particularly in the setting of KRAB-factor binding. However, a repressive chromatin alone was not sufficient to initiate DNA methylation, which required specific DNA sequences and was integration-site (and/or cell-line) specific. Overall, these results demonstrate a requirement for specific DNA sequences to trigger de novo DNA methylation, and repetitive elements as cis-regulatory factors to cooperate with advanced transcriptional repression in promoting methylation spreading.","['Zhang, Yan', 'Shu, Jingmin', 'Si, Jiali', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Zhang Y', 'Shu J', 'Si J', 'Shen L', 'Estecio MR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120517,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC3424568,2012/05/19 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['gks429 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks429 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Aug;40(15):7257-68. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks429.
