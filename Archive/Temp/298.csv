Incubation with HN2 also inhibited the influx of the potassium congener 86Rb+ to exponentially proliferating L1210 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition was specific and was accounted for by a reduction of a diuretic-sensitive component of 86Rb+ influx, identified in the preceding paper (Wilcock, C. and Hickman, J.A. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 946, 359-367) as being mediated by a Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter. Inhibition by 10 microM HN2 was complete after a 3-h incubation. There was no inhibition at this time of the ouabain-sensitive component of 86Rb+ influx, mediated by Na+/K+-ATPase. After 3 h of incubation with 10 microM HN2 there was also no change in the membrane potential of the treated cells as measured by the distribution of the [3H]TPMP+, no decrease in cellular ATP concentration and no change in intracellular pH, and the ability of the cells to exclude the vital dye Trypan blue was not significantly different from control values. These effects of HN2, therefore, appeared to follow lethal damage, but precede cell death. In the stationary phase of L1210 cell growth, the component of HN2 and diuretic-sensitive K+ influx to L1210 cells was reduced, whilst the component constituting the HN2-insensitive ouabain-sensitive sodium pump was increased. The monofunctional alkylating agent MeHN1 (2-chloroethyldimethylamine) which cannot cross-link cellular targets and has no antitumor activity, did not inhibit 86Rb+ influx to L1210 cells when incubated at equimolar or equitoxic concentrations to HN2. Intracellular potassium concentration was maintained close to control values of 138 +/- 10 mM in HN2-treated cells because of an approx. 35% fall in cell volume. The results suggest that the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter is a selectively inhibitable target for HN2, and the lesion is discussed with reference to the cytotoxic effects of this agent.","['Wilcock, C', 'Chahwala, S B', 'Hickman, J A']","['Wilcock C', 'Chahwala SB', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Diuretics)', '0 (Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Diuretics/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mechlorethamine/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/12/22 00:00,1988/12/22 00:01,['1988/12/22 00:00'],"['1988/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Dec 22;946(2):368-78. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(88)90412-9.,"['Cancer Research Campaign Experimental Chemotherapy Group, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.']","['0005-2736(88)90412-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(88)90412-9 [doi]']",,,,,

The influx was composed of a ouabain-sensitive fraction (approx. 40%), a loop diuretic-sensitive fraction (approx. 40%) and a fraction which was insensitive to both types of inhibitor (approx. 15%). The fraction of ouabain-insensitive 86Rb+ influx, which was fully inhibited by furosemide (1 mM) or bumetanide (100 microM), was completely inhibited when Cl- was completely substituted by nitrate or gluconate ions, but was slightly (29 +/- 12%) stimulated if the Cl- was substituted by Br-. The substitution of Na+ by Li+, choline or tetramethylammonium ions inhibited the loop diuretic-sensitive fraction of 86Rb+ uptake. These results suggested that a component of 86Rb+ influx to L1210 cells was mediated via a Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter. 86Rb+ efflux from L1210 cells which had been equilibrated with 86Rb+ and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mM ouabain, was insensitive to the loop diuretics. Additionally, efflux rates were found to be independent of the external concentration of K+, suggesting that efflux was not mediated by K+-K+ exchange. The initial rate of 86Rb+ influx to L1210 cells in the plateau phase of growth was reduced to 44% of that of exponentially dividing cells, the reduction being accounted for by significant decreases in both ouabain- and loop diuretic-sensitive influx; these cells were reduced in volume compared to cells in the exponential phase of cell growth. In cells which had been deprived of serum for 18 h, and which showed an increase of the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the addition of serum stimulated an immediate increase in the furosemide-sensitive component of 86Rb+ influx. Diuretic-sensitive 86Rb+ influx was not altered by the incubation of the cells with 100 microM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, but was inhibited by 10 microM of the cross-linking agent nitrogen mustard (bis(2-chloro-ethyl)methylamine, HN2).","['Wilcock, C', 'Hickman, J A']","['Wilcock C', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Diuretics)', '0 (Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Diuretics/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/12/22 00:00,1988/12/22 00:01,['1988/12/22 00:00'],"['1988/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Dec 22;946(2):359-67. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(88)90411-7.,"['Cancer Research Campaign Experimental Chemotherapy Group, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.']","['0005-2736(88)90411-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(88)90411-7 [doi]']","['AMI17433/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 09906/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Up to 24.5 g of MoAb anti-id has been administered to the patient over a period of 1 year without serious side effects. Despite a substantial amount of serum idiotype (id = 100 micrograms/ml) and a low expression of id on the tumour cells (+/- 6000 molecules per cell) clearance of serum id and a marked tumour reduction was obtained. Therapy resistance developed and coincided with a decreased clearance rate of circulating id-anti-id immune complexes and an increased modulation of cellular id expression, in vivo. This suggests that a decreased clearance rate of anti-id coated tumour cells provided more time for id modulation in vivo, resulting in therapy resistance. Therefore, the overall capacity of the natural effector system may have an important influence on the ultimate therapeutic effect of immunotherapy with MoAb anti-id. Although the partial remission obtained was not long-lasting, this study shows that MoAb anti-id therapy can be effective even when id expression on the tumour cells is low and a substantial amount of serum id is present.","['Allebes, W A', 'Preijers, F W', 'Haanen, C', 'Capel, P J']","['Allebes WA', 'Preijers FW', 'Haanen C', 'Capel PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Nov;70(3):295-300. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02485.x.,"['Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02485.x [doi]'],,,,,

Both liposomal preparations had the same liposome size distribution, drug entrapment efficiency (greater than 95%), and liposome stability (greater than 95%). Although no differences were observed in the mouse LD50 (60.2 mg/kg for L-NDDP vs 67.8 mg/kg for L-CNDP), the liposome entrapped non-DACH compound (L-CNDP) was more nephrotoxic than the liposome entrapped DACH compound (L-NDDP), but much less than cisplatin (CDDP) (mean BUN elevation 4 days after the administration of the LD50 dose 67 mg% for L-CNDP vs 30 mg% for L-NDDP vs 255 mg% for CDDP). L-NDDP was not cross-resistant with CDDP against L1210/CDDP leukemia while L-CNDP was cross-resistant (%T/C 200 for L-NDDP, 112 for CDDP, and 100 for L-CNDP). In addition, L-NDDP was slightly more active than L-CNDP against i.p. L1210/0 leukemia and i.v. M5076 reticulosarcoma. These studies suggest that the attachment of a cyclohexane group to the amino functions of lipophilic platinum complexes results in a decrease of the nephrotoxicity and a lack of cross-resistance with CDDP. The lack of cross-resistance is preserved when the compounds are entrapped and delivered in a liposomal carrier but not when they are delivered in a micellar suspension.","['Khokhar, A R', 'Al-Baker, S', 'Perez-Soler, R']","['Khokhar AR', 'Al-Baker S', 'Perez-Soler R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Liposomes)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/toxicity', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1988 Dec;3(3):177-84.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",,['CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Four patients had received prior chemotherapy. Busramustine was given orally at an initial daily dose of 50-100 mg continuously, and the dose was modified according to hematological improvement. Two cases of B-cell CLL achieved clinical complete responses, six cases including two of T-cell CLL and four of B-cell CLL achieved partial responses and one case of B-cell CLL achieved improvement. The partial and complete response rate was 72.7%. Four patients showed estrogen receptor activity of CLL cells ranging from 3.5 to 57.5 fmol/mg cytosol protein, but there seemed to be no correlation between the estrogen receptor activity of the CLL cells and the therapeutic effects of busramustine. Toxic effects included diarrhea (2/11) and estrogen-related symptoms including breast pain (4/11), genital bleeding (2/5), gynecomastia (2/6) and loss of libido (2/6). The findings of this preliminary study suggest that busramustine is effective in the treatment of CLL, irrespective of the presence of the estrogen receptor.","['Nishikawa, M', 'Uemura, Y', 'Komada, F', 'Ohno, T', 'Katayama, N', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Nishikawa M', 'Uemura Y', 'Komada F', 'Ohno T', 'Katayama N', 'Shirakawa S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '75219-46-4 (bestrabucil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Estradiol/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*drug effects']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1988 Dec;18(4):327-33.,"['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine.']",,,,,,

General malaise, chills, and nausea and vomiting were most frequently observed (66%, 59%, and 50%, respectively). The gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort and fullness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea were encountered in 72% of all the episodes, forming the second largest group next to those closely associated with high fever. These GI symptoms were usually mild and of brief durations, and their occurrence had no relation to sites of infections or etiology of bacteremia. In some cases, nausea and vomiting were aggravated by intensive antileukemic chemotherapy or massive GI bleeding. It was thus suggested that GI symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting, concomitant with a remarkable, sometimes abrupt rise in temperature during granulocytopenia may serve as a useful index for the timing for blood collection for culture to improve the probability of detection of bacteremia.","['Funada, H', 'Machi, T', 'Matsuda, T']","['Funada H', 'Machi T', 'Matsuda T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,['0 (Culture Media)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Blood/*microbiology', 'Child', 'Culture Media', 'Fever/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Middle Aged']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1988 Oct;41(10):1385-9.,"['Protected Environment Unit, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,

The results show a great heterogeneity in the cellular response to both inducers. TPA produced two major changes in B-CLL cells, namely the development of some hairy-cell leukemia features with an increase in Ig secretion and the expression of Leu M5 and TAC receptors. In contrast to TPA, RA induced only modest or no changes in surface, but increased numbers of large macrophages were seen as assessed by latex-bead ingestion, expression of Fc receptors and cytochemistry. These changes were more obvious after exposure to RA than to TPA. Thus, while TPA induces mostly differentiation and hairy-cell features in B-lymphocytes, RA induces activation of the monocyte pool with no obvious changes in the lymphocytic compartment.","['Polliack, A', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Barak, V', 'Treves, A J', 'Gazitt, Y']","['Polliack A', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Barak V', 'Treves AJ', 'Gazitt Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1988 Sep-Oct;24(9-10):522-32.,"['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,

In contrast, F-DXR was more effective than L-DXR when i.v.-administered, mg-equivalent doses were tested against ascitic and subcutaneously implanted tumors. Intraperitoneal administration of L-DXR was significantly more effective and approximately twofold less toxic than F-DXR in the treatment of an ascitic tumor.

In addition, infection of mature macrophages with ts1.1 led to their transformation and conversion into promyelocyte-like cells. We conclude that the v-ets domain of the p135gag-myb-ets protein of E26 has an effect on both erythroid and myeloid cell differentiation, suggesting a possible role for the c-ets/c-myb genes in the commitment of hematopoietic cells towards specific lineages.","['Golay, J', 'Introna, M', 'Graf, T']","['Golay J', 'Introna M', 'Graf T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology', '*Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Temperature']",1988/12/23 00:00,1988/12/23 00:01,['1988/12/23 00:00'],"['1988/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1988 Dec 23;55(6):1147-58. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(88)90259-0.,"['Differentiation Program, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']","['0092-8674(88)90259-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(88)90259-0 [doi]']",,,,,

We have employed sections of normal and tumour-bearing tissues as a test system to demonstrate the presence of tissue-specific inhibitors of guanidinobenzoatase and to exchange inhibitors on the cell-bound guanidinobenzoatase. The activity of the enzyme in vivo is suppressed by the presence of inhibitors; the latter may be displaced by oxidative disulphide-exchange reactions resulting in regain of enzymic activity on the cell surface.

We introduce here human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells as a new model system for studies of NPY action. NPY inhibited adenosine 3,5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in HEL cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 3 nM. Additionally NPY increased intracellular Ca2+, as assessed by fura-2 fluorescence, with a similar EC50. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin blocked both responses, suggesting the involvement of one or more G proteins. Chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA did not reduce the Ca2+ signal, demonstrating mobilization from intracellular stores rather than influx. Experiments with various agents demonstrated that the Ca2+ mobilization was not secondary to lowering of cAMP levels, formation of arachidonic acid products, or Na+-H+ exchange. Ca2+ mobilization also did not appear to be associated with inositol phosphate generation. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that NPY, in addition to inhibiting adenylate cyclase, also can elevate intracellular Ca2+. HEL cells should prove useful in further studies of the molecular basis of NPY action.","['Motulsky, H J', 'Michel, M C']","['Motulsky HJ', 'Michel MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['*Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors', 'Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1988 Dec;255(6 Pt 1):E880-5. doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.1988.255.6.E880.,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['10.1152/ajpendo.1988.255.6.E880 [doi]'],,,,,

The children were divided into two groups according to treatment. Twenty-eight children were given prophylactic cranial irradiation and eleven children were treated without such irradiation. The duration of cytostatic treatment was three years in all cases. Average growth during the first two years was similar in the two groups, and the standard deviation scores (SDS) were below average. The rate of growth (in height) during the fourth year was significantly higher among those children who had not received cranial irradiation (p less than 0.01). After four years the average attained height had declined 0.5 SD for children treated with cranial irradiation and 0.2 SD for children without such treatment. Weight velocity was significantly greater than the expected mean in the non-irradiated group during the first year and in the irradiated group during the fourth year of the study. Attained weight after four years had increased 0.4 SD more among those children who had not received irradiation.

High WBC counts at diagnosis and T-cell-surface markers were associated with poor prognosis, as were enthnic origin and specific HLA antigens.

Marked heterogenity is characteristic of AML blasts. Patient-to-patient variation is seen in their biological properties but is particularly evident in the response to treatment. Intraclonal variation is generated during clonal expansion, particularly as blast stem cells either undergo self-renewal or enter into a series of terminal divisions. These two alternative activities can be monitored in cell culture using a clonogenic assay and a suspension assay. The balance between renewal and differentiation can be altered by exposing blast populations to various growth factors in culture. Further, certain drugs, particularly ara-C, appear to be more toxic for self-renewing divisions than cell-cycle events generally. We suggest that both drugs and growth factors should be assessed for their effects on self-renewal as part of preclinical testing.","['McCulloch, E A', 'Kelleher, C A', 'Miyauchi, J', 'Wang, C', 'Cheng, G Y', 'Minden, M D', 'Curtis, J E']","['McCulloch EA', 'Kelleher CA', 'Miyauchi J', 'Wang C', 'Cheng GY', 'Minden MD', 'Curtis JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12 Suppl):38S-49S.,"['Division of Biological Research, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,

The genes explored included oncogenes such as c-myc, c-myb, p53, and cell-cycle-related genes such as vimentin, calcyclin, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and histone H3. Particular attention was given to analysis of the relationship existing between the mRNA levels of the histone H3 gene, which is expressed specifically in the S phase of the cell cycle, and the levels of other genes that are expressed in different stages of the G1 phase. Remarkable differences were observed among the different cases indicating that a differential expression of cell-cycle-related genes characterizes many acute leukemias. This differential expression is reflected in an altered ratio among G1-related genes and the H3 histone gene. The large fraction of leukemic cells which does not express histone H3 and therefore is functionally noncycling, shows a heterogeneous pattern of G1-related gene expression. This reflects the inability of most leukemic cells to progress through the G1 phase into the S phase of the cell cycle. This inability represents an abnormality of the cell cycle. It is concluded that the study of the expression of cell-cycle genes and protooncogenes in in understanding how leukemic cells enter a state of proliferation arrest, which appears to occur in a large fraction of leukemic cells.","['Ferrari, S', 'Calabretta, B', 'Selleri, L', 'Ceccherelli, G', 'Torelli, G', 'Torelli, U']","['Ferrari S', 'Calabretta B', 'Selleri L', 'Ceccherelli G', 'Torelli G', 'Torelli U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/analysis/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/pathology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12 Suppl):160S-166S.,"['Second Medical Clinic, University of Modena, Italy.']",,,,,,

We were interested to seek discrepancies between the surface properties of AML precursors and normal bone marrow colony formers in order to detect minimal numbers of AML cells among normal bone marrow cells in remission bone marrow. Therefore, we selected two surface markers, the MoAb CD34, reactive with blast cells, and Vim-2, a surface marker reactive with mature myeloid cells, and determined the antigen density of these markers (relative fluorescence intensity using fluorescence-activated cell sorting) for normal marrow and AML progenitors. While these markers defined an identical phenotype (CD34++/Vim-2-/+) for a broad spectrum of normal progenitors, i.e., CFU-GEMM, BFU-e, day 15 CFU-GM, and day 7 CFU-GM, referred to as the ""normal"" progenitor phenotype, AML progenitors frequently exhibited different phenotypes. In 12 of 20 cases the phenotypes of the majority of AML progenitors were discrepant from the normal surface profile, i.e., according to one marker in 8 cases (CD34-/+/Vim-2-/+ or CD34++/Vim-2++) and two markers in 4 cases (CD34-/+/Vim-2++). Since these data indicate that AML and normal progenitors were frequently distinguishable, we then determined the potential utility of these phenotypic dissimilarities for detection of minimal disease. Artificial mixtures of normal bone marrow and minimal numbers (0.1-1%) of AML cells were prepared. Based upon the phenotypic discrepancies, AML metaphases were successfully demonstrated in these mixtures following cell sorting and culture. Thus, it appears that minimal numbers of AML mitoses can be identified with an approximate 10(-2) to 10(-3) sensitivity by taking advantage of differential coexpression of surface antigens.","['Delwel, R', 'van Gurp, R', 'Bot, F', 'Touw, I', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'van Gurp R', 'Bot F', 'Touw I', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Monitoring, Immunologic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12):814-9.,"['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,

The study was done using the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique on the thawed blast cells. A consistent pattern of reactivity with McAb was found in all patients, showing that blast cells were heterogeneous. A minor component of the blast cells react with platelet antibodies, most of them being labelled with anti-GPIIb-IIIa McAb. Anti-GPIb and Von Willebrand factor McAb detected 4 times fewer megakaryocytic blast cells, suggesting that these cells are located very early in the differentiation scheme. Two major blast cell compartments were labelled with early myelomonocytic (anti-CD13: MY7) and early erythroid (anti-CD36: FA6-152) McAb.

In this study, we examined the combination of the cell differentiation inducer, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), and the cytotoxic agents, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), adriamycin (Adr) and harringtonine (HT), for cytotoxicity and induction of cell differentiation in HL-60 cells by measuring cell growth inhibition, morphological maturation and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction. To determine quantitatively whether the effects produced by these combinations were additive, synergistic or antagonistic, we used a computer program based on the median-effect principle and isobologram equations (Adv. Enz. Reg. 22, 27-55, 1984), After 5-day exposure to each drug alone we found that the ED50s for cell growth inhibition were 0.01 microM for Ara-C, 0.012 microM for Adr, 0.017 microM for HT and 2.53 mM for HMBA. ED50s for differentiation were 0.089 microM (morphology), 0.06 microM (NBT) for Ara-C; 0.12 microM (morphology), 0.09 microM (NBT) for Adr; 0.04 microM (morphology) 0.06 microM (NBT) for HT; and 2.55 mM (morphology), 2.43 mM (NBT) for HMBA, respectively. At dose levels from ED50 to ED95, the combinations of Adr/HMBA and HT/HMBA produced antagonistic cytotoxic and cell differentiation effects. The combination of Ara-C/HMBA produced antagonistic cytotoxic and cell differentiation effects. The combination of Ara-C/HMBA produced antagonistic cytotoxic effects but slight synergistic cell differentiation effects. On the basis of this study, we conclude that the equipotency combinations of the above three pairs of drugs do not synergistically enhance cytotoxicity or cell differentiation effects in vitro at effect levels high enough for the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

With more effective systemic chemotherapy program, the incidence of CNS involvement in leukemia has increased. The strategy for treatment of leukemia is that one achieves by destruction of all leukemia cells including CNS. Between 1972 and 1978, 153 children with ALL were treated with multiple methods of CNS-prophylaxis and were analyzed in relation to treatment regimens, age, sex and initial hematologic status. Patients received CNS-prophylaxis; Group I: three doses of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) and hydrocortisone (HDC), Group II: same as in Group I followed by cyclic MTX and HDC, Group III: same as in Group I plus 2,400 cGy of cranial irradiation. CNS leukemia terminated complete remission in 25 of 153 patients (16.3%). The cumulative incidence of CNS leukemia at 4-year calculated by the Kaplan-Meier Method was 40.5% in Group I, 26.9% in Group II, and 14.5% in Group III. We concluded that the combination of cranial irradiation and intrathecal MTX and HDC was highly efficacious. The efficacy of high-dose MTX with CF rescue therapy for CNS-prophylaxis was evaluated in 62 children with ALL between 1978 and 1980 (protocol 787 study), and was demonstrated to be same as cranial irradiation in standard risk of ALL. In protocol 811 study (1981-1984), the dosage of cranial radiation has been reduced from 2,400 cGy to 1,800 cGy without loss of efficacy for CNS-prophylaxis. Although CNS-leukemia was no longer an unmanageable clinical problem, and the prospects for cure of ALL appeared good, there remained question as to the toxic effects of intensive treatment on the CNS. Successful prevention of these complications will depend in large part on an understanding of their causes.","['Fujimoto, T']",['Fujimoto T'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan No Rinsho,Gan no rinsho.

Four children at the higher dosage level were also studied after an equal IV dose. The subcutaneous dose was again completely absorbed in these children at both dose levels, whereas the oral dose, which produced comparable plasma drug concentrations at the lower dosage level, resulted in a total drug exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) that was one third that of the equal subcutaneous dose at the higher dosage level.

Impact on the H-2-restricted immune responsiveness.,2319-35,"Sequence analysis of the mutant Dbm13, Dbm14, and Dbm24 genes indicate that they differ from the parental Db gene by 4, 1, and 8 nucleotides, respectively. The mutant sequences substituted into Dbm13 and Dbm24 are identical to those found in the Kb gene, at the homologous positions. Thus, similar to the Kb gene, the Db gene is able to undergo micro-recombination (gene conversion) events with other class I genes. Such data suggest that micro-recombination events could be an important mechanism for the diversification of all H-2 genes. The Db mutant products share a common theme: the alterations in all occur at amino acid residues whose side chains in the homologous class I HLA-A2 molecule project into the postulated peptide antigen-binding cleft, and hence, would be expected to alter the binding of foreign or self peptides. Due to such changes, the bm14 mouse has become a nonresponder in the CTL response to Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), as the alteration of one amino acid residue at position 70 (a Gln to His) is sufficient to entirely abrogate the cell-mediated response to the virus. On the other hand, the bm13 mouse has shifted the major part of its M-MuLV restriction to Kb, a profound alteration in CTL responsiveness due to the alteration of three amino acids (Leu to Gln at 114, Phe to Tyr at 116, and Glu to Asp at 119) in a peptide stretch of beta-pleated sheet structure lining the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft. Thus, study of these mutants reveals that, in one step, micro-recombination at the genetic level has resulted at the protein level in profound changes in the immune response to viral infection. Such a mechanism operating at the population level can be a driving force during evolution for modulating the character of CTL immunity.","['Hemmi, S', 'Geliebter, J', 'Zeff, R A', 'Melvold, R W', 'Nathenson, S G']","['Hemmi S', 'Geliebter J', 'Zeff RA', 'Melvold RW', 'Nathenson SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Conversion', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Dec 1;168(6):2319-35. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.6.2319.,"['Department of Microbiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",['10.1084/jem.168.6.2319 [doi]'],"['AI-07289/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-10702/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2189132,,,['GENBANK/Y00806']

Members of two VH gene families, VHQ52 and VH7183, are extensively interspersed and map within the same subregion. An examination of the distribution of VH group members (VH II, I, and III) within the locus suggests that two major duplications may, in part, explain the dispersed pattern of VH family clusters.

The presence of multiple (greater than 2) abnormalities (17 patients) was strongly associated with poor prognosis, with a median survival of only 7 months (p less than 0.001). Prognostic information could be attributed to 2 specific abnormalities, del(5q) and -7: Presence of del(5q) as the sole anomaly was associated with long survival (36+ months), whereas monosomy 7 was a bad prognostic sign (6 months). The risk for leukaemia development correlated neither with the number of chromosome abnormalities nor with any particular anomaly.

A report on 29 cases.,297-302,"Twenty-nine adult patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and an excess of marrow blasts were treated by aggressive chemotherapy while still in MDS phase (20 cases) or after progression to ANLL (9 cases). Median age was 47.5 (range 18-68). Twenty-eight patients received a combination of Rubidazone and Ara C and 1 received High dose Ara C. Fourteen patients (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 5 (17%) were treatment failures (F) and 10 (35%) died during therapy induced aplasia (DA). Median disease free survival was 8.5 months. Median survival of the whole population was 6 months from the onset of treatment, and 17 months in patients achieving CR. These results were significantly less favorable than those obtained at our institution in de novo ANLL with the same chemotherapy regimens. No statistically significant prognostic factors of treatment outcome emerged but patients with normal cytogenetic findings seemed to have both a higher CR rate and longer remissions than patients with abnormal karyotypes. Patients under 50 did not have higher CR rates than older patients, although they had longer remissions (with 3 out of 6 CRs exceeding 2 years). Finally, treatment outcome and survival were identical in patients treated in the MDS phase and in those treated after progression to ANLL. Combination chemotherapy is a highly toxic approach in MDS and essentially seems to benefit younger patients with a normal karyotype, in whom some long remissions can be obtained.","['Fenaux, P', 'Lai, J L', 'Jouet, J P', 'Pollet, J P', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Lai JL', 'Jouet JP', 'Pollet JP', 'Bauters F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Nov;57(5):297-302. doi: 10.1007/BF00320357.,"['Service des Maladies du Sang, C.H.U., Lille, France.']",['10.1007/BF00320357 [doi]'],,,,,

The Dami cells grow primarily in suspension with a doubling time of 24 to 30 hours. By light and electron microscopy, the Dami cells range in size from 12 to 120 micron in diameter and have lobulated nuclei characteristic of megakaryocytes. At least 89% of the cells react with monoclonal antibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GP) Ib and IIB/IIIa, and glycophorin. The cells do not react with antibodies against lymphoid, monocyte, granulocyte, or macrophage antigens. Thirteen percent of the cells become polyploid, spontaneously achieving greater than 4N DNA ploidy levels. In response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the proportion of cells with ploidy levels greater than 4N increased threefold and could be separated into discrete ploidy groups. PMA also increased the expression of GPIb, the GPIIb/GPIIIa complex,l and von Willebrand factor. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a human male hyperdiploid karyotype with a modal chromosome number of 54 to 64 and several consistent clonal chromosomal abnormalities. These included a partial deletion of chromosome 5 and a translocation involving chromosome 3. In contrast to other megakaryocytic cell lines in which only a small portion of the cells express the megakaryocytic phenotype, nearly all of the Dami cells express platelet glycoproteins. Thus, the Dami cells provide a superior model in which to study human megakaryocyte biochemistry and differentiation.","['Greenberg, S M', 'Rosenthal, D S', 'Greeley, T A', 'Tantravahi, R', 'Handin, R I']","['Greenberg SM', 'Rosenthal DS', 'Greeley TA', 'Tantravahi R', 'Handin RI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Glycophorins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Ploidies', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1968-77.,"[""Hematology Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['S0006-4971(20)82156-9 [pii]'],"['P0I HL 33014/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I HL 24787/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Patients were chosen for study if there were a clinical suggestion of in vivo maturation and a leukemic clone exhibiting a distinguishable karyotypic abnormality. Mature peripheral blood granulocytes were enriched by two-step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient sedimentation and fused with mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells to induce the formation of prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC). These PCC were then analyzed for chromosome number per cell (in the case of patients with a numerical abnormality) or by G-banding (in the case of specific translocations). Of 13 patients chosen for study, 12 showed karyotypic evidence for maturation of the abnormal elements in vivo. Maturation was observed in a number of clinical situations including before treatment in benign CML and myelodysplasia, after low-dose and high-dose chemotherapy in myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and in remission. These results suggest that the technique of premature chromosome condensation can be a powerful tool in better understanding the biology of disease and mode of response to therapy in vivo in patients with leukemia and preleukemic syndromes, especially during treatment with agents thought to induce maturation of the leukemic elements.","['Hittelman, W N', 'Agbor, P', 'Petkovic, I', 'Andersson, B', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Walters, R', 'Koller, C', 'Beran, M']","['Hittelman WN', 'Agbor P', 'Petkovic I', 'Andersson B', 'Kantarjian H', 'Walters R', 'Koller C', 'Beran M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1950-60.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['S0006-4971(20)82154-5 [pii]'],"['CA 27931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

Intravenous (IV) administration of a single dose of recombinant murine TNF-alpha (10(5) U per mouse) significantly suppressed normal and leukemic late-stage erythropoiesis as measured by numbers of mature erythroid colony forming cells (CFU-E) in the bone marrow and spleen and by peripheral blood reticulocyte counts. In normal animals, the immature erythroid (BFU-E), macrophage (CFU-M), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) compartments were significantly stimulated by TNF-alpha in both the bone marrow and the spleen. In the bone marrow of leukemic mice, the BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-M progenitor cell compartments were also stimulated by treatment with the monokine. In the spleens of leukemic mice (the primary site of FV leukemia cell accumulation), relative numbers of BFU-E and CFU-GM were increased by TNF-alpha, while those of CFU-M were suppressed. TNF-alpha caused a rapid decrease in the markedly elevated spleen weights of progressively leukemic mice, and in multiple doses it caused complete clinical disease regression in a significant percentage of leukemic animals. The combination of TNF-alpha with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased the incidence of leukemia regression, compared with TNF-alpha alone. These results show that TNF-alpha exerts a suppressive influence on late-stage erythropoiesis in vivo and suggest that this effect might be exploited in the treatment of acute erythroleukemia, erythroid hyperplasias, and related diseases.","['Johnson, C S', 'Chang, M J', 'Furmanski, P']","['Johnson CS', 'Chang MJ', 'Furmanski P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1875-83.,"['Department of Cell Biology, AMC Cancer Research Center, Denver, CO 80214.']",['S0006-4971(20)82143-0 [pii]'],"['CA33188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

These polypeptides are part of enzyme complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Prolonged inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis thus reduces the oxidative phosphorylation capacity which ultimately results in impairment of energy-requiring processes. Via a different mechanism glucocorticoid hormones also decrease the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of, e.g., lymphoid cells. The present study shows that inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis influences glucocorticoid-induced responses of lymphoid cells in two opposing manners. (a) It is enhanced after induction in cells with a reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacity resulting from preceding inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. This can be explained by the synergistic effects of glucocorticoids and prolonged inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis on energy-producing processes. (b) It is counteracted when mitochondrial protein synthesis is impaired during induction of the response. The latter observation suggests that mitochondrial protein synthesis is involved in the generation of glucocorticoid-induced effects on lymphoid cells.","['Van den Bogert, C', 'Dontje, B H', 'Melis, T E', 'van der Veen, C', 'Kroon, A M']","['Van den Bogert C', 'Dontje BH', 'Melis TE', 'van der Veen C', 'Kroon AM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Adrenalectomy', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Thymus Gland/anatomy & histology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/12/09 00:00,1988/12/09 00:01,['1988/12/09 00:00'],"['1988/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Dec 9;972(3):302-10. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(88)90206-6.,"['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, State University Groningen, The Netherlands.']","['0167-4889(88)90206-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(88)90206-6 [doi]']",,,,,

At commencement of interferon, seven patients had progressive cytopenia, and one was in leukemic phase (greater than 20 x 10(9)/L circulating hairy cells). All patients had had previous splenectomy. Interferon was administered subcutaneously. The initial dose was 3 x 10(6) U/day, continued until peripheral counts stabilised. Subsequently, patients received 6 x 10(6) U/day, 9 x 10(6) U/day, and finally 12 x 10(6) U/day. The dose increases proceeded every 8-12 weeks, as tolerated. Seven patients had an objective response. There were four complete remissions, two partial remissions, and one minor response. Complete remission was documented only in patients on at least 6 x 10(6) U/day for 12 weeks. The median time to complete remission was 40 weeks (range 35-53). Normalisation of peripheral blood counts preceded histologic marrow improvement. The median times for response (platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/L, hemaglobin greater than or equal to 12 gm/dL, neutrophils greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10(9)/L), were six to eight and 17 weeks, respectively. Toxicity included myelosuppression during the first four weeks of therapy. With increasing doses of interferon, myelosuppression did not recur. A transient, mild, flu-like syndrome affected all patients. Two patients developed asymptomatic transaminitis at doses greater than 6 X 10(6) U/day. This resolved with dose reduction. In one case impotence was reported during the first four weeks of each interferon level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Holmes, R', 'Schwarz, M A', 'Whiteside, M G', 'Firkin, F C']","['Holmes R', 'Schwarz MA', 'Whiteside MG', 'Firkin FC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1988 Jun;18(4):557-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1988.tb00124.x.,"['Alfred Hospital, Prahran, Vic, Australia.']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1988.tb00124.x [doi]'],,,,,

All cells appear viable by trypan blue dye exclusion, although they do not proliferate, and DNA and cell protein synthesis decrease to less than 3% of uninfected controls within 24 hours; (2) an intermediate stage extending from day 5 to about day 24-30 pi in which the amount of infectious virus declines to low levels. During this stage, viral protein synthesis decreases to undetectable levels, although viral gylcoproteins are readily demonstrated by immunofluorescence and by immunoblot; however, capsid protein appears to degrade within 21 days pi. Cell numbers remain constant but the viability of the non-proliferating cells determined by trypan blue exclusion could not be determined with confidence; (3) a final long-term stage in which viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are detectable by immunoblots and immunofluorescence for many months but the cells are metabolically inactive and do not synthesize viral proteins.

Clinical identification of a low-risk subgroup at presentation.,2561-8,"To determine whether cancer patients with fever and neutropenia differ in their medical stability, 261 medical records of 184 cancer patients who were hospitalized with fever and neutropenia and treated with conventional antibiotic therapy were studied to determine whether their presenting clinical characteristics influenced the likelihood of subsequent clinical events thought to require urgent medical attention. Overall, serious medical complications, including those without an obvious relationship to infection, occurred in 56 patient courses (21%). We distinguished three clinically determined subgroups of our study population at significantly higher risk than the remaining patient group, which seemed to be at low risk. Major complications occurred in 34 (34%) of 101 inpatients, 12 (55%) of 22 outpatients with concurrent comorbidity requiring inpatient care, and eight (31%) of 26 outpatients without concurrent comorbidity requiring inpatient care but with uncontrolled cancer. However, the remaining patients, who presented as outpatients without significant comorbidity or uncontrolled cancer, had major complications in only 2% of 112 hospitalizations. These results suggest that it may be possible to assess the medical stability of patients with fever and neutropenia based on presenting clinical features. If confirmed prospectively, these results may enable clinicians to identify groups of medically stable patients for whom conventional supportive care, including appropriately administered antibiotics, may be given safely under medical supervision of less intensity or of shorter duration than conventional treatment in the acute-care hospital setting.","['Talcott, J A', 'Finberg, R', 'Mayer, R J', 'Goldman, L']","['Talcott JA', 'Finberg R', 'Mayer RJ', 'Goldman L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/*complications/drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Neutropenia/*complications/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1988 Dec;148(12):2561-8.,"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",,"['1F32CA08242-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA09172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

To evaluate the management of perianal infections in patients with granulocytopenia and acute leukemia, all such patients treated at Emory University Hospital between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1985, were reviewed. Twenty patients were found to have severe granulocytopenia (fewer than 500 polymorphonuclear leukocytes/mm3) and perianal infection, representing 5.7 per cent of all hematology service admissions during that period. Eleven patients were managed conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive measures, and nine patients underwent operative drainage of the perianal infection in addition to conservative measures. The two groups were similar in respect to age, associated conditions, length of hospitalization, and degree of perianal infection, with the exception that operatively drained patients were more likely to have positive blood cultures (7/9 operatively drained; 4/11 conservatively managed). Mortality was higher in the operatively drained group (44.4% vs 9% in the conservatively managed), and three patients had progression of the local infection after drainage, two of whom required a diverting colostomy. The overall mortality attributed to perianal disease in these severely granulocytopenic patients was 25 per cent. From this review, operative drainage of perianal infection does not appear to increase survival or decrease morbidity in patients with severe granulocytopenia.","['Carlson, G W', 'Ferguson, C M', 'Amerson, J R']","['Carlson GW', 'Ferguson CM', 'Amerson JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Anus Diseases/surgery/*therapy', 'Bacterial Infections/surgery/*therapy', 'Drainage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Therapeutic Irrigation']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am Surg. 1988 Dec;54(12):693-5.,"['Emory University School of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",,,,,,

Ten girls, treated earlier for ALL, experienced the menarche at a mean age of 12.2 years. This is significantly earlier than the mean for Swedish girls. Prepubertal growth was near normal after the end of therapy for leukaemia. Mean final height was -1.7 SD, which is 1.5 SD less than at onset and 1.0 SD less than 1 year after the end of treatment. Thirteen other girls had a blunted spontaneous secretion of GH, several years after treatment for ALL; there was no increase in GH secretion during puberty.

One rearrangement reflected a normal TCRA variable (V) region V alpha-to-J alpha recombination. The second rearrangement was caused by the translocation even itself, which joined a DNA segment from 14q32 centromeric to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) and a J alpha gene located approximately 75 kilobases (kb) 5' of the TCRA constant region gene (C alpha). A third rearrangement involved a 17-kb internal deletion 3' to the translocation, a rearrangement within the J alpha locus that has been observed once before in a patient with AT. Analysis of these three rearrangements underscores the increase in aberrant locus-specific recombination in lymphocytes from patients with AT.

We now show that these two inv(14) breakpoints are linked by 2.1 kb of germ-line 14q32 DNA and that the three breakpoints define, by in situ hybridization analysis, a single locus at chromosome band 14q32.1 located about 15-20 million base pairs on the centromeric side of the IGH locus. Sequence analysis of the 14q32.1 breakpoint regions indicates that abnormal recombination does not universally result from mistaken V-D-J joining (D = diversity region; J = joining region).

Previous experiments have shown that induction by HMBA involves transient genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA that is achieved by replacement of 5-methylcytosine with cytosine residues. The experiments described in the present communication revealed that hypomethylation is a very early event in the process of differentiation. Exposure of the cells to 3-deazaadenosine, an adenosine analog, in combination with homocysteine, resulted in the intracellular accumulation of 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine, which caused an inhibition of HMBA-induced hypomethylation that was correlated with a comparable inhibition of differentiation. While these experiments suggest that hypomethylation is a necessary step in the process of differentiation, other experiments reported here indicate that hypomethylation of DNA may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger the whole program of differentiation in MEL cells. We found, for example that exposure of the cells to cycloheximide during the first 24 hr of induction by HMBA resulted in complete inhibition of differentiation without significant effect on the HMBA-induced hypomethylation. This result also indicates that the enzymatic machinery required for the hypomethylation of DNA is present in uninduced cells.","['Razin, A', 'Levine, A', 'Kafri, T', 'Agostini, S', 'Gomi, T', 'Cantoni, G L']","['Razin A', 'Levine A', 'Kafri T', 'Agostini S', 'Gomi T', 'Cantoni GL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Tubercidin/pharmacology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Dec;85(23):9003-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.23.9003.,"['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['10.1073/pnas.85.23.9003 [doi]'],,PMC282650,,,

Expression of exogenous c-myb or c-fos oncogene completely inhibited Epo-induced erythroid differentiation but only partially inhibited dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation. Normally Epo-induced differentiation leads to a drastic decline of c-myb mRNA levels and an increase of c-myc transcripts in the early stage of differentiation. Cells expressing exogenous c-fos gene, however, maintained high levels of c-myb mRNA after Epo treatment. This high level of c-myb transcripts was found to be due to block of transcription shutoff (or transcriptional activation) rather than to mRNA stabilization. It is concluded that the down-regulation of endogenous c-myb gene expression is a prerequisite for commitment of Epo-induced erythroid differentiation and that expression of c-myb gene may be indirectly regulated by c-fos gene product. We also concluded that early down-regulation of c-myc gene expression is not essential for erythroid differentiation and that gene regulation of chemically induced erythroid differentiation may differ from that of Epo-induced differentiation.","['Todokoro, K', 'Watson, R J', 'Higo, H', 'Amanuma, H', 'Kuramochi, S', 'Yanagisawa, H', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Todokoro K', 'Watson RJ', 'Higo H', 'Amanuma H', 'Kuramochi S', 'Yanagisawa H', 'Ikawa Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Dec;85(23):8900-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.23.8900.,"['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['10.1073/pnas.85.23.8900 [doi]'],,PMC282614,,,

In ALL, breakpoints have been reported within the Mbcr but also in more 5' regions encompassing the BCR gene. To characterize the latter breakpoints, we have molecularly cloned and mapped the entire gene, which encompasses approximately 130 kb of DNA. Mbcr negative, Ph'-positive ALL breakpoints were not distributed at random within the gene but rather were found exclusively within the 3' half of the first BCR gene intron. In contrast to the Mbcr, which is limited to a region of 5.8 kb, this part of the intron has a size of 35 kb.

Potentiation and induction of DEX-sensitivity by ADP-ribosylation inhibitors was accompanied by an increase in saturable 3H-DEX binding sites and by a 2-3 fold increase in the affinity of intracellular receptors for hormone binding. Moreover, the ribosylation inhibitors converted the glucocorticoid antagonist RU-486 into a potent agonist for cytolysis of L1210 cells.

No significant effects on affinity were found, as Kd control values for receptors derived from rat bone marrow averaged 57 (+/- 28) pM while experimental (hypoxic) values averaged 89 (+/- 55) pM. Kd control values in rat lung were found to average 142 (+/- 22) pM while average values derived from experimental protocols with ozone and methimazole were 267 (+/- 44) pM and 161 (+/- 35) pM respectively.

Parallel experiments done with receptors derived from rat liver yielded values similar to those reported by other investigators and were unaffected by the experimental agents.

Particle agglutination and ELISA were performed for screening; Western blot was done for confirmation. True-positive sera were found at a prevalence of 0.12% in a cohort of 846 individuals at risk for AIDS tested in 1984-1985. Prevalences of 0.35% were found among 575 HIV-I positives tested in 1987, and of 1.3% among 292 HIV-I positives of a different group tested in 1988. The 6 positives found in our study represent the first cases of HTLV-I infection, or HIV-I/HTLV-I double infection, diagnosed in Switzerland. In addition, high proportions of sera, regardless of whether they were from normal blood donors, HIV-positives, or individuals at risk for AIDS, had antibodies that reacted weakly with one or several proteins of the size of viral gag proteins. The prevalence of such antibodies in normal donors was in the range of 10 to 40%, depending on the strictness of interpretation. Competition Western blots performed with some of these sera showed that these antibodies reacted with HTLV-I, but not with HIV-I or cellular antigens, and had a lower affinity to HTLV-I proteins than the antibodies of human or goat antisera. The results indicate that these antibodies may be induced by agents immunologically related to, but different from, HTLV-I, which are highly prevalent in the Swiss population. Oligopeptide stretches with sequence homology to HTLV-I are known to exist in various normal body proteins, several infectious agents including common viruses and protozoa, but the results might also indicate the existence of additional human retroviruses. Screening of blood donors with sensitive tests for antibodies to HTLV-I might produce an unacceptably high rate of false-positive results, if stringent rules of interpretation analogous to those common in HIV screening are not used.","['Schupbach, J', 'Baumgartner, A', 'Tomasik, Z']","['Schupbach J', 'Baumgartner A', 'Tomasik Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Agglutination Tests', '*Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cross Reactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HIV Seropositivity/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis', 'Switzerland']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Dec 15;42(6):857-62. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420611.,"['Swiss National Center for Retroviruses, Institute of Immunology and Virology, University of Zurich.']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420611 [doi]'],,,,,

The ability of these agents to bind DNA appeared to be related to cytotoxic potency, however this did not appear to be a direct quantitative correlation. Two enantiomers of a bis-indole analog of CC-1065 were studied for DNA binding and cytotoxic activity. The agent with the same stereochemical configuration as CC-1065 was a potent cytotoxin, but its enantiomer was essentially inactive. Both enantiomers showed significant binding to DNA, but the biologically less active isomer showed less overall binding. In all cases, the agents preferred AT-rich DNA, and all bound to similar regions in DNA as evidenced by positions of drug-initiated thermal breaks in single end-labelled fragments of phi X 174RF DNA. The overall similarity in site specificity for binding of the structurally diverse agents suggests that much of the specificity observed in binding of the agent to DNA lies in the DNA itself. Thus, it may be difficult to change minor groove specificity for agents of this type simply by designing structures that can encompass guanine or cytosine residues. Other modifications, such as changing the specificity of the alkylating moiety, may be required to achieve this goal.","['Swenson, D H', 'Petzold, G L', 'Williams, M G', 'Li, L H', 'Prairie, M D', 'Krueger, W C']","['Swenson DH', 'Petzold GL', 'Williams MG', 'Li LH', 'Prairie MD', 'Krueger WC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '101222-80-4 (U 71184)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '67I85E138Y (piperidine)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Superhelical/drug effects', 'Duocarmycins', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leucomycins/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1988;67(3-4):199-213. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(88)90058-0.,"['Karkinos Biochem.

Accordingly, the effect of dDAVP on the cytocidal activity of melphalan in L5178Y cells was evaluated. dDAVP did not affect the cytocidal activity of melphalan in these cells, but significantly affected the cloning efficiency of stationary phase or slowly dividing L5178Y cells over a range of concentrations. In particular, stationary phase cells showed an increase in cloning efficiency from 4.3 +/- 0.5% in control cells to 7.0 +/- 0.3% in cells treated with 25 nM dDAVP (P less than 0.001), whereas cells doubling every 26 h showed an increase from 10.8 +/- 1.2% in control cells to 21.0 +/- 2.0% in cells treated with 150 nM dDAVP (P less than 0.001). This phenomenon was associated with significant elevations of 1,2[3H] diacylglycerol after incubation with dDAVP for 9 min (P less than 0.01) and of total [3H]diacylglycerols after incubation for both 3 min (P less than 0.05) and 9 min (P less than 0.02). Within 10 s of treatment with 100 nM dDAVP, there was a marked decrease in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1-phosphate, but subsequently no change was observed for up to 9 min after treatment. We postulate that the increase of diacylglycerol content produced by dDAVP might be primarily from a phosphatidylcholine source and that the growth-promoting activity of desmopressin may be a consequence of activation of protein kinase C.","['Beenken, S W', 'Batra, J K', 'Gerrard, J M', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['Beenken SW', 'Batra JK', 'Gerrard JM', 'Goldenberg GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (1,2-diacylglycerol)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/*pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Melphalan/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Vasopressins/pharmacology']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Dec 15;48(24 Pt 1):7055-9.,"['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",,,,,,

The present study shows that 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid but not ascorbic acid prolongs the lifespan of mice into which tumors such as Meth A fibrosarcoma, MM46 mammary carcinoma, Ehrlich carcinoma and sarcoma 180 are implanted. The potentiated cytotoxicity of 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid is not due to an increase in duration time of the cytotoxic action, because 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid is gradually inactivated during contact with tumor cells and exhibits a similar action time curve to that of ascorbic acid as shown by clonal growth assay. Cytotoxicity of 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid is markedly diminished by combined addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as shown by dye exclusion assay, whereas the cytotoxicity was slightly reduced by either enzyme alone but not by the specifically inactivated or heat-denatured enzymes. In contrast, cytotoxicity of ascorbic acid is abolished by catalyse but not SOD. Autooxidation of 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid was not inhibited by catalase plus SOD. The results indicate that cytotoxicity of 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid is attributed at least partly to both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2-.) generated at the early stage. Cytotoxicity of 6-O-palmitoyl ascorbic acid is also appreciably attenuated by singlet oxygen (1O2) scavengers such as hydroquinone, 1,4-diazobicyclo-2,2,2-octane or sodium azide, but not by hydroxyl radical scavengers including butylated hydroxytoluene, D-mannitol, benzoic acid and ethanol. Thus, in contrast to cytotoxicity of ascorbic acid mediated entirely by H2O2 initially generated, acylated ascorbic acid produces a diversity of active oxygen species including H2O2, O2-. and other species secondarily generated via disproportion, which may be additively involved in the enhanced cytotoxic action.","['Miwa, N', 'Yamazaki, H', 'Nagaoka, Y', 'Kageyama, K', 'Onoyama, Y', 'Matsui-Yuasa, I', 'Otani, S', 'Morisawa, S']","['Miwa N', 'Yamazaki H', 'Nagaoka Y', 'Kageyama K', 'Onoyama Y', 'Matsui-Yuasa I', 'Otani S', 'Morisawa S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Free Radicals)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'QN83US2B0N (6-O-palmitoylascorbic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/antagonists & inhibitors']",1988/11/18 00:00,1988/11/18 00:01,['1988/11/18 00:00'],"['1988/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Nov 18;972(2):144-51. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(88)90113-9.,"['Department of Antibiotics, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0167-4889(88)90113-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(88)90113-9 [doi]']",,,,,

Reduced derivatives of 2-amino-4-oxo-10-methyl-pteroyl-ornithine had dramatically increased inhibitory potency against FPGS compared to the oxidized parent. The amino-pterin analog (2,4-diamino-pteroylornithine) was a potent inhibitor of both dihydrofolate reductase and FPGS. It was a much more potent linear competitive inhibitor of human FPGS than the corresponding methotrexate derivative previously described (Ki = 0.15-0.26 and 3 microM respectively). A quinazoline folate analog, 2-amino-4-oxo-5,8-dideazapteroyl-ornithine, was a relatively poor inhibitor of isolated dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase; however, it is the most potent human FPGS inhibitor identified to date (Ki = 100-150 nM). Because of the lack of appreciable interaction with other folate-dependent enzymes, structures incorporating the 2-amino-4-oxo-5,8-dideazapteroate nucleus may thus lead to selective inhibition of FPGS. Substitution of ornithine for glutamate caused a profound decrease in cytotoxic potency for these analogs; this was apparently the result of poor transport. Together with earlier studies, these data indicate that the potency of FPGS inhibition by an analog containing ornithine closely parallels the relative substrate activity of its glutamate-containing counterpart. The substitution of ornithine apparently does not perturb the pterin specificity of FPGS. The close parallel between substrate and inhibitor specificity may thus allow the use of currently available structure-activity studies on FPGS to design more potent and more selective inhibitors of FPGS.","['McGuire, J J', 'Bolanowska, W E', 'Piper, J R']","['McGuire JJ', 'Bolanowska WE', 'Piper JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 1.2.- (Aldehyde Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.2.3.1 (Aldehyde Oxidase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Oxidase', 'Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/physiology', 'Animals', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rabbits', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Oct 15;37(20):3931-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90076-7.,"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']","['0006-2952(88)90076-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90076-7 [doi]']","['CA 24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

There was also no significant difference between the leukocyte velocities of the leukopenic patients and control subjects (0.47 +/- 0.19 mm/s and 0.55 +/- 0.14 mm/s, respectively; 89% power for a difference of 0.2 mm/s, 59% for 0.1). There was a correlation between the leukocyte count and the number of leukocytes seen in the entoptoscope. The results suggest that retinal vascular autoregulation can compensate for changes in leukocyte numbers that might have been expected to alter retinal blood flow.","['Rimmer, T', 'Kohner, E M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Rimmer T', 'Kohner EM', 'Goldman JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Ophthalmol,"Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",7706534,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/physiopathology', 'Leukopenia/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Retinal Vessels/*physiopathology']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Ophthalmol. 1988 Nov;106(11):1548-52. doi: 10.1001/archopht.1988.01060140716041.,"['Department of Medicine, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['10.1001/archopht.1988.01060140716041 [doi]'],,,,,

It is characterized by abrupt alteration in mental status and respiratory alkalosis associated with markedly elevated plasma ammonium levels in the absence of any identifiable cause, and frequently results in intractable coma and death. Our goal was to survey clinical and pathologic manifestations of the disorder and discuss treatment options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma ammonium levels were measured in patients on the acute leukemia service or on the bone marrow transplant service at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and a level more than twice normal was considered diagnostic of hyperammonemia. The syndrome was identified in nine patients; in eight, hyperammonemia occurred after administration of intensive cytoreductive therapy that resulted in profound leukopenia. The disorder occurred in the ninth patient two months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Three of the nine patients survived an episode of idiopathic hyperammonemia; one patient subsequently died of leukemia and one of recurrent idiopathic hyperammonemia. The one long-term survivor is currently alive and well without neurologic sequelae 250 days after autologous bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: Because neurologic function can deteriorate rapidly, early recognition of this disorder and close monitoring of the patient's neurologic status are critical.","['Mitchell, R B', 'Wagner, J E', 'Karp, J E', 'Watson, A J', 'Brusilow, S W', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Storb, R', 'Santos, G W', 'Burke, P J', 'Saral, R']","['Mitchell RB', 'Wagner JE', 'Karp JE', 'Watson AJ', 'Brusilow SW', 'Przepiorka D', 'Storb R', 'Santos GW', 'Burke PJ', 'Saral R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['7664-41-7 (Ammonia)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ammonia/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Syndrome']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Nov;85(5):662-7. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80239-0.,"['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']","['S0002-9343(88)80239-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80239-0 [doi]']","['P01-CA15396-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Am J Med. 1989 Aug;87(2):249-50.

Our intention was to systematically investigate the incidence of the bcr rearrangement in such patients, and to correlate the findings with patient characteristics, response to therapy (especially alpha interferon treatment), and overall prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Molecular analysis studies were performed in 40 patients with Ph-negative CML (23 patients) and myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; 17 patients). RESULTS: Rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was detected in 11 of the 23 patients with Ph-negative CML (48 percent), indicating the presence of the abnormal molecular events in Ph-positive CML without documentation of the Ph cytogenetic abnormality. None of the 17 patients with CMML had the bcr rearrangement. Patients with Ph-negative CML and the bcr rearrangement had characteristics similar to those of patients with Ph-positive disease. These included a younger age, higher white blood cell counts, a higher incidence of thrombocytosis and basophilia, and a lower occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score was not a helpful distinguishing feature. Among 21 patients receiving alpha interferon-based regimens, response to therapy was significantly better among patients with Ph-negative disease and the bcr rearrangement (seven of seven, 100 percent), compared with those without the bcr rearrangement (one of six, 17 percent), or patients with CMML (two of eight, 25 percent) (p less than 0.01). At this time of follow-up, only one of the 11 patients with Ph-negative CML and the bcr rearrangement had died from complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, compared with three deaths among the 12 patients with Ph-negative CML and no bcr rearrangement, and 11 deaths among the 19 patients with CMML. CONCLUSION: We conclude that molecular studies help in better understanding the nosology of Ph-negative CML, and define a subgroup of patients with clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic correlations similar to those of patients with Ph-positive CML.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Shtalrid, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Blick, M', 'Dalton, W T', 'LeMaistre, A', 'Stass, S A', 'McCredie, K B', 'Gutterman, J', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Shtalrid M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Blick M', 'Dalton WT', 'LeMaistre A', 'Stass SA', 'McCredie KB', 'Gutterman J', 'Freireich EJ', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Probes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Nov;85(5):639-44. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80235-3.,"['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']","['S0002-9343(88)80235-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80235-3 [doi]']",,,,,

In an effort to achieve a better outcome in patients with these infections, aggressive management was combined with medical/surgical intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 18 immunocompromised patients with invasive sinonasal fungal infections was retrospectively analyzed. Management consisted of a combined modality clinical approach, including aggressively sought early diagnosis; early amphotericin use; extensive surgical debridement; and liberal use of granulocyte transfusion support. RESULTS: Eight of 13 patients with eventual neutrophil recovery survived with control of all local and systemic signs of fungal infection. All patients with persisting neutropenia died of progressive infection. CONCLUSION: We conclude that meticulous surveillance of patients in high-risk groups for fungal infection should be maintained due to the apparent value of rapid intervention with a combination of surgical resection and medical management (antifungal chemotherapy and white blood cell transfusions). Infection control and survival are ultimately dependent on recovery of marrow function and circulating neutrophils.","['Goering, P', 'Berlinger, N T', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Goering P', 'Berlinger NT', 'Weisdorf DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Nose Diseases/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Paranasal Sinus Diseases/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Nov;85(5):619-23.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['S0002-9343(88)80232-8 [pii]'],['P01 CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

A dose-response effect was present. Railroad workers, heavy equipment operators, miners, and truck drivers had a higher mortality both for all causes and for lung cancer when compared with subjects with other occupations and no exposure to DE. Truck drivers exposed to DE were not at excess risk of lung cancer if compared with truck drivers unexposed to DE, but a trend of increasing risk with duration of exposure was suggested. DE exposure was also associated with increase in mortality for accidents, cerebrovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.

When there is a healthy worker effect, the MORi will always overestimate the SMRi and will always be greater than the PMRi. The PMRi is influenced by the relative frequency of the cause of death. For rare causes, such as brain cancer or leukemia, the PMRi will overestimate the SMRi to essentially the same degree as the MORi. For more common conditions, such as lung cancer, the PMRi will overestimate or underestimate the SMRi depending on the magnitude of the healthy worker effect. When the SMRi = 1 and there is a healthy worker effect, both the PMRi and MORi are in excess of one (1) regardless of the disease rate. As the SMRi increases it is more likely to be bounded by the PMRi (lower) and the MORi (upper).

We recognized the previous efforts in 1967 (published again in 1973 as the report of the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force [1] and 1978 of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) [2]). We have used these reports for guidance during the current effort. Several noteworthy developments in the past few years have made it necessary to modify the previous guidelines. First, the diagnostic criteria for CLL and its clinical staging have been developed and well defined. Second, although staging systems facilitated entry of comparable and relatively homogeneous groups of patients in clinical trials, the definitions of response (CR) and partial response (PR) were not uniformly adopted from the previous guidelines in the clinical trials (Tables IA, IB); therefore, comparisons of results obtained in different studies became difficult. Third, there has been an improvement in our understanding of the immunology and biology of CLL. Finally, we are witnessing the emergence of several chemotherapy agents that promise impressive activity in CLL (e.g., 2'-deoxycoformycin [3], fludarabine monophosphate [4, 5]), and thereby offer the potential for improving survival time in this disease. To best identify regimens worthy of continued pursuit in large comparative trials, standardized guidelines for evaluation are essential. A number of laboratory investigations are also presented for which scientific interest is high yet relevance remains to be determined; thus, they are presented as companion studies to the clinical trials. This mechanism allows for flexibility in the testing of these questions and for additional ideas in the future without requiring modification of an entire treatment protocol. The following guidelines were developed to be used as a form of standardization for clinical trials, incorporating current technologies, yet remaining relevant to the general hematology/oncology community. Based on the membership of the Working Group, it is expected that these guidelines will serve as the criteria for most clinical trials in the near future.","['Cheson, B D', 'Bennett, J M', 'Rai, K R', 'Grever, M R', 'Kay, N E', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Oken, M M', 'Keating, M J', 'Boldt, D H', 'Kempin, S J']","['Cheson BD', 'Bennett JM', 'Rai KR', 'Grever MR', 'Kay NE', 'Schiffer CA', 'Oken MM', 'Keating MJ', 'Boldt DH', 'Kempin SJ', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Guideline', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/standards', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Drug Evaluation/standards', 'Eligibility Determination/standards', '*Health Planning', '*Health Planning Guidelines', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'United States']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Nov;29(3):152-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830290307.,"['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['10.1002/ajh.2830290307 [doi]'],,,,,

Twelve patients (27.9%) showed alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) activity in their leukemic cells, and two of these cases revealed remarkably low myeloperoxidase (MPO) positivity, a pattern seen in monocytic precursors. However, further cytochemical evidence for this monocytic feature, the inhibition of naphthol AS-D acetate esterase (NASDA) activity with sodium fluoride (NASDA-F), was found in only five of these nine patients. In 31 cases (72.1%), there was minimal ANAE activity. Of interest, two of these were devoid of naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase (CAE), which is prominently displayed in neutrophilic granulocytes, even though these leukemic cells were 100% intensely positive for MPO activity. Between the two groups with and without ANAE activity, there were no remarkable differences in the distribution of sex and age, hematological findings, and rates of complete response.

Complete responses (CR) were seen in five patients (42%) and partial responses (PR) in three patients (25%). Treatment resulted in overall and clonal cytoreduction, which was evident by serial bone marrow exams and bone marrow cytogenetic analysis. The ability to obtain a CR correlated with the finding of a low initial marrow cellularity (P less than .05).

Ten patients who had histologically proved leukemia or aplastic anemia were then examined. The data show that changes in fat fraction represent the underlying reason for many of the changes observed in conventional spin-echo (SE) images of these disorders. Although both conventional and chemical shift images showed differences among the pathologic groups and healthy volunteers, fat fraction determined with chemical shift imaging was the single best discriminator among them. A two-point estimate of fat fraction was also evaluated.

Among 150,000 patients reported to one of 19 population-based cancer registries or treated in any of 20 oncology clinics, 4188 women with second cancers and 6880 matched controls were selected for detailed study. Radiation doses for selected organs were reconstructed for each patient on the basis of her original radiotherapy records. Very high doses, on the order of several hundred gray, were found to increase the risk of cancers of the bladder [relative risk (RR) = 4.0], rectum (RR = 1.8), vagina (RR = 2.7), and possibly bone (RR = 1.3), uterine corpus (RR = 1.3), cecum (RR = 1.5), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 2.5). For all female genital cancers taken together, a sharp dose-response gradient was observed, reaching fivefold for doses more than 150 Gy. Several gray increased the risk of stomach cancer (RR = 2.1) and leukemia (RR = 2.0). Although cancer of the pancreas was elevated, there was no evidence of a dose-dependent risk. Cancer of the kidney was significantly increased among 15-year survivors. A nonsignificant twofold risk of radiogenic thyroid cancer was observed following an average dose of only 0.11 Gy. Breast cancer was not increased overall, despite an average dose of 0.31 Gy and 953 cases available for evaluation (RR = 0.9); there was, however, a weak suggestion of a dose response among women whose ovaries had been surgically removed. Doses greater than 6 Gy to the ovaries reduced breast cancer risk by 44%. A significant deficit of ovarian cancer was observed within 5 years of radiotherapy; in contrast, a dose response was suggested among 10-year survivors. Radiation was not found to increase the overall risk of cancers of the small intestine, colon, ovary, vulva, connective tissue, breast, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For most cancers associated with radiation, risks were highest among long-term survivors and appeared concentrated among women irradiated at relatively younger ages.","['Boice, J D Jr', 'Engholm, G', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Blettner, M', 'Stovall, M', 'Lisco, H', 'Moloney, W C', 'Austin, D F', 'Bosch, A', 'Cookfair, D L', 'Krementz, E T', 'Latourette, H B', 'Merrill, J A', 'Peters, L J', 'Schulz, M D', 'Storm, H H', 'Bjorkholm, E', 'Pettersson, F', 'Janine Bell, C M', 'Coleman, M P', 'Fraser, P', 'Neal, F E', 'Prior, P', 'Choi, N W', 'Hislop, T G', 'Koch, M', 'Kreiger, N', 'Robb, D', 'Robson, D', 'Thomson, D H', 'Lochmuller, H', 'von Fournier, D', 'Frischkorn, R', 'Kjorstad, K E', 'Rimpela, A', 'Pejovic, M H', 'Kirn, V P', 'Stankusova, H', 'Berrino, F', 'Sigurdsson, K', 'Hutchison, G B', 'MacMahon, B']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Engholm G', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Blettner M', 'Stovall M', 'Lisco H', 'Moloney WC', 'Austin DF', 'Bosch A', 'Cookfair DL', 'Krementz ET', 'Latourette HB', 'Merrill JA', 'Peters LJ', 'Schulz MD', 'Storm HH', 'Bjorkholm E', 'Pettersson F', 'Janine Bell CM', 'Coleman MP', 'Fraser P', 'Neal FE', 'Prior P', 'Choi NW', 'Hislop TG', 'Koch M', 'Kreiger N', 'Robb D', 'Robson D', 'Thomson DH', 'Lochmuller H', 'von Fournier D', 'Frischkorn R', 'Kjorstad KE', 'Rimpela A', 'Pejovic MH', 'Kirn VP', 'Stankusova H', 'Berrino F', 'Sigurdsson K', 'Hutchison GB', 'MacMahon B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', '*Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1988/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 Oct;116(1):3-55.,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,"['N01-CP0-1047/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP1-1017/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP3-1035/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

In this patient's leukemic cells, the breakpoint of the t(14;18) translocation occurred in the major breakpoint-cluster region of the BCL2 gene and became linked to the JH4 joining-region gene segment of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on the 14q+ chromosome as previously observed in follicular lymphoma. An N region and heptamer and nonamer signal sequences indicated that this translocation occurred as a mistake in VH-DH-JH joining (where VH and DH are the variable and diversity segments). In the t(8;14) translocation, the breakpoint was located immediately 5' of the first exon of the MYC protooncogene, which was juxtaposed with the C gamma 2 constant gene segment of the second 14q+ chromosome. The finding of repeated sequences typical of switch regions suggested that this translocation occurred during heavy-chain isotype switching, resulting in progression to pre-B-cell leukemia with both the t(8;14) and the t(14;18) translocations. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-positive phenotype of the patient's leukemic cells further suggests that the pre-B-cell leukemia was derived from a pre-B cell carrying a t(14;18) translocation in the original follicular lymphoma. The polymerase chain reaction method was then used to identify cancer cells in the bone marrow of the patient.","['Gauwerky, C E', 'Haluska, F G', 'Tsujimoto, Y', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Gauwerky CE', 'Haluska FG', 'Tsujimoto Y', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Nov;85(22):8548-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8548.,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['10.1073/pnas.85.22.8548 [doi]'],"['CA 01279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC282496,,,"['GENBANK/J04104', 'GENBANK/J04105']"

Evolution of histopathological lesions and clinical course in 40 patients.,434-45,"A clinicopathological follow-up study was performed on 17 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and 23 cases with so-called primary (idiopathic) osteo-/myelofibrosis (OMF) concentrating on a comparison between clinical data and multiple sequential biopsies of the bone marrow. Histological classification of bone marrow lesions was done according to the subtypes proposed by Georgii et al. At clinical diagnosis initial trephine biopsies in CML showed in only 6/17 cases a pronounced granulocytic proliferation or CGL. In 9/23 patients with OMF a so-called hyperplastic or early hypercellular stage was encountered with a mixed megakaryocytic-granulocytic pattern without or with minimal reticulin fibres (CMGM/EMS). The histopathology of this early stage OMF as well as the later evolving advanced fibrosclerotic lesions (AMS/OMS) were by morphological aspects alone not distinguishable from cases with CML showing prominent fibrosclerotic alterations. At presentation 5/17 patients with CML displayed already some degree of reticulin fibre formation (EMS). Following serial trephine biopsies in CML with an increased megakaryocyte proliferation (CMGM), a remarkable tendency for myelofibrosis was present. The dynamics of this fibrosclerotic transformation seem to be variable in CML and OMF likewise. However, they are related to abnormal megakaryopoiesis as well as to duration respectively progress of disease, paralleled by corresponding haematological parameters. This longitudinal case control study emphasizes that histopathology of the bone marrow taken at clinical diagnosis may reflect different stages of chronic myeloproliferative diseases and therefore should be always accompanied by relevant clinical and cytogenetic findings to enable a correct diagnosis.","['Thiele, J', 'Simon, K G', 'Fischer, R', 'Zankovich, R']","['Thiele J', 'Simon KG', 'Fischer R', 'Zankovich R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*pathology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1988 Aug;183(4):434-45. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(88)80090-6.,"['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, F.R.G.']","['S0344-0338(88)80090-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(88)80090-6 [doi]']",,,,,

Between 24 and 60 h after induction, there was a dramatic switch in histone gene expression, such that the ratio of PRD to FRD transcripts increased severalfold over that found in uninduced MEL cells. We demonstrated that this gene switching was not simply a partial or complete uncoupling of PRD gene expression from DNA synthesis. PRD and FRD transcript levels were regulated coordinately upon treatment of uninduced or induced MEL cells with inhibitors of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, or both. Using several criteria, we were unable to detect any difference in PRD and FRD gene expression under any conditions except in cells undergoing differentiation. MEL cells were arrested at a precommitment stage of differentiation by induction with HMBA in the presence of dexamethasone (DEX). If DEX was subsequently removed, DNA synthesis resumed, the cells underwent commitment, and histone gene switching was observed.

The localization and pattern of expression of 4HFDH/DHFR in cultured bone marrow stromal cells were studied in situ in morphologically identifiable cells. The 4HFDH/DHFR expression varies quantitatively and qualitatively according to cell types and thus constitutes specific phenotypic patterns for fibroblastic stromal cells, endothelial cells, monocyte-macrophages, and osteoclast-like cells. Data indicate a good correlation between the labeling of the enzymic expression and the resistance of cells to methotrexate treatment. This conclusion is also supported by similar features shown by cell sublines bearing multiple DHFR gene copies. Levels of 4HFDH/DHFR expression in marrow stromal cells should provide useful markers underlining the effects of cytostatic drugs used in chemotherapy (for example, methotrexate injuries or resistance). The method can be applied to isolated cells, stromal colonies (fibroblast CFU), or whole adherent layers from marrow cultures. Moreover, with this method, enzymic reactions can be carried out in situ and visual correlations between a supportive microenvironment (hemopoietic foci) and the 4HFDH/DHFR levels on the stromal adherent layer are possible.","['Miszta, H', 'Dabrowski, Z', 'Lanotte, M']","['Miszta H', 'Dabrowski Z', 'Lanotte M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium/drug effects/enzymology', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/enzymology', 'Methotrexate', 'Monocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Nov;2(11):754-9.,"['Institute of Zoology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",,,,,,

To determine the nature of the process by which this occurs, a group of single-cell derived clones was produced from HL-60 cells after prolonged passage under alkaline conditions. When these clones were induced to mature with butyric acid, each clone demonstrated a characteristic proportion of mature eosinophils and neutrophils. This property was stable for multiple passages. Subclones derived from these clones also demonstrated the same probability of differentiating to an eosinophil as their parent clones. Reversion toward neutrophilic differentiation gradually occurred after several months of culture under conditions of reduced pH. The most highly directed clones demonstrated 90-95% eosinophilic differentiation and continued to differentiate primarily to eosinophils after seven months of culture at the reduced pH. Thus, in HL-60 cells, the tendency to differentiate to an eosinophil is a long-lived, heritable, continuously variable phenotype that is inducible in cells by culture under alkaline conditions. This tendency persists for prolonged periods after the alkaline conditions are removed, but may gradually revert toward neutrophilic differentiation with time.","['Fischkoff, S A']",['Fischkoff SA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)']",IM,"['Agar', 'Butyrates', 'Butyric Acid', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', '*Culture Media', 'Eosinophils/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Probability', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(8):679-86. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90103-8.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-4283.']","['0145-2126(88)90103-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(88)90103-8 [doi]']",,,,,

Gamma interferon most closely mimicked the effect of conditioned medium in inducing clonogenic suppression and the induction of monocytic maturation over 7 days of culture. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor induced enhancement of proliferation followed by clonogenic suppression, while granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor had a purely stimulatory effect on proliferation over a 7-day period.

Since alkylating agents play an important role as antitumor drugs, nicotine may influence the anticancer activity of anticancer drugs, especially alkylating agents. Two tumor models were selected: (a) autochthonous, MNU-induced mammary carcinoma and (b) transplanted rat leukemia L5222. The antitumor drugs investigated were cyclophosphamide (CPA) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitroso-3-(2-hydroxyethyl) urea (HECNU). Nicotine was administered continuously by Alzet-osmotic minipumps, at a dose of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg daily. Under these conditions the observed nicotine and cotinine plasma levels approximated levels measured in heavy smokers (nicotine peak level, 47 ng/ml; cotinine peak level, 635 ng/ml). In MNU-induced autochthonous mammary carcinoma, a solid hormone-dependent tumor, the combination of HECNU and nicotine yielded greater tumor inhibition than HECNU alone. The anticancer activity of CPA on transplanted L5222-leukemia, on the other hand, was decreased by continuous infusion of nicotine. The interpretation of both results has to take into account the following possibilities of nicotine action: influence on (a) microcirculation, (b) cell proliferation, (c) membrane transport, (d) metabolism of cytotoxic drugs, and (e) hormonal milieu. The results demonstrate that nicotine is able to influence the outcome of antitumor treatment. The mechanism of interaction needs clarification. Additionally, further combination studies with other classes of cytotoxic drugs are warranted.","['Berger, M R', 'Zeller, W J']","['Berger MR', 'Zeller WJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'NAT2FD82D7 (elmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nicotine/*administration & dosage', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1988;66 Suppl 11:127-33.,"['Institute of Toxicology and Chemotherapy, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",,,,,,

The env gene was inserted into the VV hemagglutinin gene. The resultant inactivation of the hemagglutinin gene led to the attenuation of VVs, but the extent of their attenuation depended on the VV strain. The propagation of LC16mO and its RVV in rabbit brain was poorer than that of LO-1, a cloned derivative of Lister strain, and its RVV, although LC16mO replicated in other organs better than did LO-1.

Structure-activity relationships of aromatic amides with retinoidal activity.,2182-92,"Two types of aromatic amides, terephthalic monoanilides and (arylcarboxamido)benzoic acids, have been shown to possess potent retinoidal activities and can be classified as retinoids. The structure-activity relationships of these amides are discussed on the basis of differentiation-inducing activity on human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60. In generic formula 4 (X = NHCO or CONH), the necessary factors to elicit the retinoidal activities are a medium-sized alkyl group (isopropyl, tert-butyl, etc.) at the meta position and a carboxyl group at the para position of the other benzene ring. The bonding of the amide structure can be reversed, this moiety apparently having the role of locating the two benzene rings at suitable positions with respect to each other. Substitution at the ring position ortho to the amide group or N-methylation of the amide group caused loss of activity, presumably owing to the resultant change of conformation. It is clear that the mutual orientation of the benzylic methyl group(s) and the carboxyl group and their distance apart are essential factors determining the retinoidal activity. Among the synthesized compounds, 4-[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)carbamoyl]benz oic acid (Am80) and 4-[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)carboxamido] benzoic acid (Am580) were several times more active than retinoic acid in the assay.

Hydrogenation of both the 9,10 double bond and the pyrido ring of 9a and 9b (MeOH-0.1 N HCl, 3.5 atm, Pt) was followed by ester hydrolysis to give 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (11a) and the 5-methyl analogue 11b. Biological evaluation of 6, 7, 11a, and 11b for inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) isolated from L1210 cells and for growth inhibition and transport characteristics toward L1210 cells revealed 6 to be less potent than methotrexate in the inhibition of DHFR and cell growth. Compounds 6, 11a, and 11b were transported into cells more efficiently than methotrexate. Growth inhibition IC50 values for 11a and 11b were 57 and 490 nM, respectively; the value for 11a is in good agreement with that previously reported (20-50 nM). In tests against other folate-utilizing enzymes, 11a and 11b were found to be inhibitors of glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GAR formyltransferase) from one bacterial (Lactobacillus casei) and two mammalian (Manca and L1210) sources with 11a being decidedly more inhibitory than 11b. Neither 11a nor 11b inhibited aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. These results support reported evidence that 11a owes its observed antitumor activity to interference with the purine de novo pathway with the site of action being GAR formyltransferase.","['Piper, J R', 'McCaleb, G S', 'Montgomery, J A', 'Kisliuk, R L', 'Gaumont, Y', 'Thorndike, J', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Piper JR', 'McCaleb GS', 'Montgomery JA', 'Kisliuk RL', 'Gaumont Y', 'Thorndike J', 'Sirotnak FM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*chemical synthesis']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Nov;31(11):2164-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00119a018.,"['Kettering-Meyer Laboratory, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama 35255.']",['10.1021/jm00119a018 [doi]'],"['CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

Trypsin-treated HTG-VLDL (tryp-VLDL), devoid of apolipoprotein (apo)-E, fail to bind to the LDL receptor, yet tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL cross-compete for binding to P388D1 macrophage receptors, indicating that these lipoproteins bind to the same sites. The specific, high affinity binding of tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL to macrophages at 4 degrees C is equivalent and at 37 degrees C both produce rapid, massive, curvilinear (receptor-mediated) triglyceride accumulation in macrophages. Ligand blots show that P388D1 macrophages express a membrane protein of approximately 190 kD (MBP190) that binds both tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL; this binding is competed by HTG-VLDL, trypsinized HTG-VLDL, and trypsinized normal VLDL but not by normal VLDL or LDL. The macrophage LDL receptor (approximately 130 kD) and cellular uptake of beta-VLDL, but not MBP 190 nor uptake of tryp-VLDL, are induced when cells are exposed to lipoprotein-deficient medium and decreased when cells are cholesterol loaded. Unlike the macrophage LDL receptor, MBP 190 partitions into the aqueous phase after phase separation of Triton X-114 extracts. An anti-LDL receptor polyclonal antibody blocks binding of HTG-VLDL to the LDL receptor and blocks receptor-mediated uptake of beta-VLDL by P388D1 cells but fails to inhibit specific cellular uptake of tryp-VLDL or to block binding of tryp-VLDL to MBP 190. Human monocytes, but not human fibroblasts, also express a binding protein for HTG-VLDL and tryp-VLDL similar to MBP 190. We conclude that macrophages possess receptors for abnormal human triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are distinct from LDL receptors in ligand specificity, regulation, immunological characteristics, and cellular distribution. MBP 190 shares these properties and is a likely receptor candidate for the high affinity uptake of TG-rich lipoproteins by macrophages.","['Gianturco, S H', 'Lin, A H', 'Hwang, S L', 'Young, J', 'Brown, S A', 'Via, D P', 'Bradley, W A']","['Gianturco SH', 'Lin AH', 'Hwang SL', 'Young J', 'Brown SA', 'Via DP', 'Bradley WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*blood', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, LDL/analysis', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1988 Nov;82(5):1633-43. doi: 10.1172/JCI113775.,"['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['10.1172/JCI113775 [doi]'],['HL27341/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC442732,,,

Although all the four prosomal antigens tested are present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, slight differences in the immunofluorescent patterns indicate that each antigen may have a particular cytological distribution that varies in the course of differentiation.","['Grossi de Sa, M F', 'Martins de Sa, C', 'Harper, F', 'Coux, O', 'Akhayat, O', 'Pal, J K', 'Florentin, Y', 'Scherrer, K']","['Grossi de Sa MF', 'Martins de Sa C', 'Harper F', 'Coux O', 'Akhayat O', 'Pal JK', 'Florentin Y', 'Scherrer K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,['0 (Ribonucleoproteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*analysis', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ducks', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*analysis', 'Species Specificity']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1988 Feb;89 ( Pt 2):151-65.,"['Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France.']",,,,,,

Hence, we determined whether the steroid's maturational effect on HL-60 involves alterations of intracellular calcium [( Ca2+]i). We found that, as detected by indo-1 fluorescence, [Ca2+]i increases in a slow tonic manner from 99 +/- 11 nM in virgin HL-60 to 182 +/- 19 nM (p less than 0.001) in those treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h. The first apparent rise in [Ca2+]i occurs at between 6 and 12 h and parallels expression of alpha-thrombin and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) receptors. This increase in [Ca2+]i is derived from extracellular calcium as its reduction abolishes the effect. The increase in [Ca2+]i is associated with an increase in inositol trisphosphate-stimulated Ca2+ flux from intracellular stores. Interestingly, 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated HL-60 differentiation as manifest by expression of the macrophage-specific antigen, 63D3, is not blocked by low extracellular calcium. In contrast, the fMLP-induced superoxide ion generation is diminished if the increase in [Ca2+]i is prevented. Furthermore, fMLP-stimulated signal transduction is also reduced by limiting the stimulation of [Ca2+]i during 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Thus, although differentiation of HL-60 to the monocytic phenotype by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is Ca2+-independent, expression of response to regulatory stimuli requires priming of cellular Ca2+ stores. The latter appears to be induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 via stimulated Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane.","['Hruska, K A', 'Bar-Shavit, Z', 'Malone, J D', 'Teitelbaum, S']","['Hruska KA', 'Bar-Shavit Z', 'Malone JD', 'Teitelbaum S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology']",1988/11/05 00:00,1988/11/05 00:01,['1988/11/05 00:00'],"['1988/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Nov 5;263(31):16039-44.,"['Department of Medicine, Jewish Hospital, Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['S0021-9258(18)37553-7 [pii]'],"['AR32087/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR34401/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DE05413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

One mechanism by which cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy is pleiotropic multidrug resistance, characterized by cross resistance to a number of otherwise unrelated heterocyclic antineoplastic agents, including vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, dactinomycin, and others. We have studied a drug sensitive human leukemia cell line, CEM; a pleiotropic multidrug resistant subline of CEM, CEM/VLB100; VLB-1, a drug sensitive revertant subline arising during in vivo passage of CEM/VLB100; and a methotrexate resistant subline of CEM, CEM-MTX. Using soft-agar colony formation after graded doses of X rays as an endpoint, we found that CEM, CEM-MTX, and CEM/VLB100 had similar terminal slopes (D0 = 0.66 Gy). However, the CEM/VLB100 survival curve had a broader initial shoulder (n = 3.0, Dq = 0.75 Gy) than did CEM (n = 1.6, Dq = 0.25 Gy) or CEM/MTX (n = 1.0, Dq = 0 Gy), suggesting that CEM/VLB100 has an increased capacity to repair radiation-induced DNA damage. This was tested by comparing the cell lines' abilities to accumulate sublethal damage. In split dose recovery experiments, CEM/VLB100 demonstrated increased ability to repair sublethal radiation damage following fractionated irradiation compared with the CEM parental line. Although it no longer demonstrated multidrug resistance, VLB-1 still displayed diminished radiation sensitivity. On the basis of these and other investigators' results, we suggest that diminished radiation sensitivity is separate from, but can be closely associated with, the multidrug-resistant phenotype.","['Shimm, D S', 'Olson, S', 'Hill, A B']","['Shimm DS', 'Olson S', 'Hill AB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Phenotype', '*Radiation Tolerance']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Oct;15(4):931-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(88)90128-9.,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson 85724.']","['0360-3016(88)90128-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(88)90128-9 [doi]']",['CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

In a previous report, we demonstrated uniform decreases in spontaneous secretion of growth hormone following 2400 cGy whole brain radiation. In this study, we measured basal growth hormone levels every 20 minutes over 24 hr in five survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1800 cGy cranial radiation. Four of the patients had been off therapy 2 9/12-4 3/12 years. Growth hormone secretion in these patients, as indicated by mean growth hormone concentration, pulse amplitude and frequency, was clearly greater than that seen following 2400 cGy and appeared to be normal compared with sex- and Tanner stage-matched literature controls. However, serial growth measurements showed significant decreases in height percentiles in two of these children. The fifth patient, who had already approached her adult height at the time of diagnosis, had been off therapy only 1 year and had a mean growth hormone level intermediate between those of normal controls and previously reported children treated with 2400 cGy. These data suggest (a) that the effect of radiation therapy on spontaneous pulsatile growth hormone secretion may be dose related, and (b) that short stature in a given patient may not be indicative of subnormal basal growth hormone levels. Further longitudinal investigation may clarify whether early transient changes in GH secretion occur that may normalize over time.","['Blatt, J', 'Lee, P', 'Suttner, J', 'Finegold, D']","['Blatt J', 'Lee P', 'Suttner J', 'Finegold D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Central Nervous System/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Periodicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Oct;15(4):1001-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(88)90138-1.,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15213.""]","['0360-3016(88)90138-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(88)90138-1 [doi]']",['2MO1RR00084/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

The products were identified by comparison with standards for T-2 tetraol, T-2 triol, HT-2 toxin, neosolaniol and T-2. Qualitatively, similar metabolic pathways were found in all cells examined. The presence of these metabolites demonstrated that T-2 was taken up by these cells.

Despite a decrease in colony numbers at high MC concentrations, some cell lines showed a sustained proliferation as measured by growth index calculations and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. This indicates that at certain MC concentrations colony formation is not always a reflection of proliferation. BrdUrd incorporation yielded an extremely low proliferation capacity for HCL.

In spite of the activation of the Na+,K+ -pump the membrane-potential dependent accumulation of [3H]TPP+ was about 40 per cent reduced in the presence of medium amino acids indicating a decreased membrane potential under these conditions. On the other hand, monensin which induces an electrically silent Na+ -influx via Na+/H+ -exchange was shown to hyperpolarize the membrane on the basis of [3H]TPP+-accumulation.

Proliferation in a population defined by light-scatter and surface-antigenic characteristics was assessed by measuring the percentage of cells in this population having more than 2C amount of DNA (""proliferation index""). Viable, low-density (1.077 g/cm3), bone marrow cells, stained with monoclonal antibodies conjugated with fluorescein or phycoerythrin, were fixed with paraformaldehyde and subsequently treated with the detergent, Tween 20. The UV-excitable DNA stain Hoechst 33342 was used to quantify DNA content in the cells without interference with immunofluorescence. A FACS IV flow cytometer was used, equipped with the first laser at 488 nm emitting for light scattering and immunofluorescence measurements and the second laser emitting at 360 nm for the Hoechst excitation. The Hoechst uptake was the same for all bone marrow populations, yielding a tight coefficient of variation (CV) (average 5.0%) for the G0/G1 DNA peak. This permitted high sensitivity of cell detection in S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, while preserving light-scattering properties of the cells and maintaining cell surface immunofluorescence. The lowest ""proliferation index"" detected using this technique was 0.08% in a sample obtained from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Normal helper T lymphocytes in marrow had approximately 0.5% of the cells in S, G2, or M phase.

Although these data are preliminary and are not indicative of an actual increase in the incidence of malignancies other than malignant lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma in the AIDS setting, clinicians should be aware of the possible association of these tumors with HIV infection.","['Tirelli, U', 'Vaccher, E', 'Zagonel, V', 'Rezza, G', 'Palmieri, G', 'Pizzoccaro, G', 'Parrinello, A E', 'Carbone, A', 'Monfardini, S']","['Tirelli U', 'Vaccher E', 'Zagonel V', 'Rezza G', 'Palmieri G', 'Pizzoccaro G', 'Parrinello AE', 'Carbone A', 'Monfardini S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1988;12(1-6):267-72.,"['Gruppo Italiano Cooperativo AIDS & Tumori (GICAT), Aviano, Italy.']",,,,,,

In contrast, HL60/MRI, a cell line established from a transplantable HL60 tumor in nude mice, differentiates to monocytoid cells in response to RA (M. Imaizumi, J. Uozumi, and T. R. Breitman, Cancer Res., 47: 1434-1440, 1987). Because alterations of proto-oncogene expression may be closely related to the difference in response of HL60/MRI to RA we studied the expression of the proto-oncogenes myc, fms, and N-ras of HL60/MRI in comparison to HL60. Compared to HL60, the proto-oncogene myc of HL60/MRI is amplified about twofold less in genomic DNA and is expressed about twofold less at the transcriptional level. Even though two subclones of HL60/MRI, 28B.4 and 5B, have about the same steady-state levels of c-myc mRNA before treatment with RA, 28B.4 has a more rapid decrease of c-myc mRNA after treatment with RA. Based on two differentiation markers, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction and the OKM-5 monocyte-specific surface antigen, 28B.4 exhibits a greater response to RA than does 5B. c-fms mRNA is not detected in uninduced HL60/MRI and HL60 but is expressed during RA-induced differentiation of HL60/MRI to monocytes/macrophages and HL60 to granulocytes. The expression of N-ras mRNA of 5B decreases about twofold during the first 12 h of exposure to RA and is then relatively constant for another 36 h.","['Imaizumi, M', 'Breitman, T R']","['Imaizumi M', 'Breitman TR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Dec 1;48(23):6733-8.,"['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,

This is the first time a physical agent has been shown to induce the differentiation of this leukemic cell line. The treatment of HL-60 cells with a variety of agents which have been documented to stress cells and induce thermotolerance or a heat shock-like response also induced granulocyte-like differentiation: continuous treatment for 4 days with ethanol (213 mM), sodium arsenite (6 microM), cadmium sulfate (60 microM), lidocaine (3 mM), and procaine (5 mM) induced 73, 54, 14, 54, and 55% of cells, respectively, to reduce the dye nitro blue tetrazolium. They were also capable of the phagocytosis of yeast particles. Examination of differentiated cells showed that those treated with ethanol, arsenite, lidocaine, and procaine also expressed nonspecific esterase activity, typical of monocytes, but did not adhere to plastic and had a cellular and nuclear morphology consistent with differentiation to metamyelocytes. Analysis of protein synthesis of HL-60 cells treated with 170 mM N-methylformamide, by the pulse labeling of cells for 2 h with [14C]leucine at various times, showed that the constitutive synthesis of both the Mr 90,000 and 70,000 heat shock proteins fell substantially after 2 h of exposure to N-methylformamide. When HL-60 cells were incubated with 1 M N-methylformamide, a toxic concentration of this agent, or were heat shocked, the synthesis of both the Mr 70,000 and Mr 90,000 proteins was induced. We propose that changes in heat shock protein synthesis may be an important element of the induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells, particularly as these proteins have recently been shown to regulate the stability of oncogene proteins, such as myc (Luscher, B., and Eisenman, R.

Inhibition of DNA synthesis is a consequence of platination and has become accepted as the critical step in cis-DDP-induced toxicity. We have previously demonstrated that, following incubation with cis-DDP, murine leukemia L1210 cells progress through synthesis only to arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The G2 arrest was transient at low drug concentrations and was persistent at higher concentrations with a concomitant loss of viability. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines both proficient and deficient for DNA excision repair have been used to analyze the relationship between inhibition of DNA synthesis and toxicity and to determine whether DNA repair is necessary for cell cycle progression. Two repair-deficient cell lines were hypersensitive to cis-DDP and demonstrated a marked arrest in the G2 phase. The arrest was transient over only a small range of concentrations. At higher concentrations, the arrest was persistent and the cells subsequently died. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into macromolecules demonstrated no inhibition of DNA synthesis while these cells progressed through the S phase. In contrast, at higher, but nontoxic, concentrations of cis-DDP, the repair-proficient cells exhibited inhibition of DNA synthesis while in S. At toxic concentrations, these cells also arrested in G2. Therefore, direct inhibition of DNA synthesis correlated only with the concentration of drug and not with the different sensitivities of the cell lines. Arrest of cells in G2 did correlate with toxicity. In every cell line, the appearance of G2-arrested cells preceded cell disintegration. It is proposed that the G2-arrested cells preceded cell disintegration. It is proposed that the G2 arrest results from the inability of the cells to transcribe genes required for passage into mitosis. Cells proficient in DNA repair can circumvent this arrest by repairing the damaged DNA and permitting transcription to proceed. These results support the hypothesis that inhibition of DNA synthesis is not the critical step in cis-DDP-induced cytotoxicity.","['Sorenson, C M', 'Eastman, A']","['Sorenson CM', 'Eastman A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Dec 1;48(23):6703-7.,"['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68105.']",,"['CA00906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

SOD levels in hexamethylene bisacetamide-treated MELC were about twice as high as those of controls. Dose response and kinetic experiments have shown that SOD activity variations are closely related to the amount of inducer and the duration of treatment in culture. Moreover, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which inhibits hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced MELC maturation, was also effective in reducing the extent of the SOD increase. SOD changes mainly involved the CuZn form of the enzyme, having a molecular weight of about 32,000 and a striking sensitivity to cyanide inhibition. In addition, the isoelectrophoretic analysis of CuZn-SOD from both treated and untreated cells yielded an identical pattern. This suggests that quantitative rather than qualitative enzyme changes occurred during MELC terminal division. SOD levels are directly related to the degree of differentiation and particularly to the amount of cytosolic hemoglobin, whose synthesis in committed cells is paralleled by a rise in enzyme activity. The SOD increase represents a distinctive marker of erythroleukemia maturation and might tentatively be interpreted as a cellular response to oxidative stress from hemoglobin autoxidation.","['Paoletti, F', 'Mocali, A']","['Paoletti F', 'Mocali A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Dec 1;48(23):6674-7.,"['Istituto di Patologia Generale, Universita di Firenze, Italy.']",,,,,,

Earlier work had indicated that these changes did not occur in a differentiation-resistant MEL cell variant and suggested that the decrease in the level of DNA ligase activity might be related to the differentiation process. Since the MEL cells accumulate high levels of both hemoglobin-bound and non-hemoglobin-bound heme, the effect of both hemoglobin and hemin on DNA ligase activity of MEL cell extracts was tested. When cell-free extracts containing DNA ligase activity were preincubated with hemin at concentrations up to 150 microM, an 80% or greater inhibition of the DNA ligase activity resulted. The ATP-dependent DNA ligase from bacteriophage T4 was also inhibited by hemin, but the NAD-dependent DNA ligase from Escherichia coli was not sensitive to this treatment. Preincubation of these same extracts with hemoglobin at levels comparable to those present in differentiating cells did not result in inhibition of any of the ATP-dependent DNA ligases tested. Culturing the cells with dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of imidazole resulted in a marked decrease in globin chain accumulation but did not reverse the dimethyl sulfoxide-related decrease in DNA ligase activity. These data suggest the possibility that heme or its metabolites, but not globin or hemoglobin, could serve to modify the process of DNA replication and/or repair in differentiating MEL cells via inhibition of DNA ligase activity. These data are consistent with the findings of Lo et al. (S.C. Lo, R. Aft, and G.C.

Apparently normal karyotypes were observed in two cases, and a third contained a rearrangement that did not appear to involve chromosomes 9 or 22. The other three cases had translocations involving chromosome band 9q34 but no case contained the common derivative chromosome 9pter----9q34::22q11----22qter.

Considerable complexity exists in the types of genetic changes that can juxtapose bcr and the c-abl oncogene in CML.

No major structural alterations were observed at these three genetic loci.

However, most patients eventually require further therapy. We have analyzed the case histories of 194 patients with HCL who had splenectomy as initial therapy. The median time to failure (second therapy or death) was 18.8 months. Univariate analysis of prognostic variables demonstrated that age, hemoglobin level, platelet count, bone marrow cellularity, bone marrow hairy cells, and hairy cell index (HCI) were statistically significant predictors of failure-free survival (FFS). However, only the bone marrow cellularity and platelet count were significant independent prognostic variables by Cox analysis. The patients were divided into the following three subsets by prognosis after splenectomy: (1) low risk of failure (cellularity less than 85% and platelet count greater than or equal to 60,000/microliters), (2) intermediate risk (cellularity less than 85% and platelet count less than 60,000/microliters), and (3) high risk (cellularity greater than or equal to 85%). The median FFS for each of these subsets was 56.5 months, 11.7 months, and 5.4 months, respectively. The median overall survival after splenectomy has not been reached with follow-up of up to 22 years. Patients diagnosed since 1982 have a better overall prognosis than those diagnosed earlier, with 4-year survivals of 88% and 68%, respectively (P less than 0.01). We conclude that splenectomy should continue to be the standard initial therapy in HCL. However, patients with bone marrow cellularity of 85% or greater have a short duration of response to splenectomy, and thus, may be considered for initial systemic therapy.","['Ratain, M J', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Barker, C M', 'Golomb, H M']","['Ratain MJ', 'Vardiman JW', 'Barker CM', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/mortality/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Dec 1;62(11):2420-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881201)62:11<2420::aid-cncr2820621129>3.0.co;2-i.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, Illinois.']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19881201)62:11<2420::aid-cncr2820621129>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],,,,,

The typical plasma cell neoplasms accounted for only one third of the cases, multiple myeloma (MM) and systemic amyloidosis (AL) being diagnosed in 18% and 15% of the patients, respectively. Eighteen (27%) of the patients were recognized as having malignant nonHodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), 21 (32%) had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 2 (3%) had hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Three patients (5%) without apparent evidence of any malignant immunoproliferative disease were classified as having a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The greatest urinary concentrations of BJP were found in plasmacytic neoplasms, the daily excretion of MM patients being significantly higher than that of AL patients. Considerably lower BJP outputs were recorded in the other diseases, the lowest ones being associated with MGUS. NHL patients had a daily excretion four times higher as compared with that of CLL patients. The distribution of NHL by histologic type was: follicular center cell lymphomas (FCCL) 39%, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 33%, immunoblastic lymphoma (IBL) 17%, and plasmacytoid lymphocytic lymphoma (PLL) 11%. The highest BJP levels were found in PLL, and the lowest ones in FCCL. In CLL patients the amount of urinary BJP correlated significantly with the tumor load, as estimated by the number of enlarged lymphoid areas. The study suggests that detection and measurement of isolated urinary BJP may provide useful data for the clinical evaluation of a wide spectrum of immunoproliferative disorders.","['Pascali, E', 'Pezzoli, A']","['Pascali E', 'Pezzoli A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['9006-99-9 (Bence Jones Protein)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Amyloidosis/urine', 'Bence Jones Protein/*urine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoproliferative Disorders/*urine', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/urine', 'Plasmacytoma/urine', 'Proteinuria/*etiology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Dec 1;62(11):2408-15. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881201)62:11<2408::aid-cncr2820621127>3.0.co;2-2.,"['Institute of General Clinical Medicine, University of Trieste, Italy.']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19881201)62:11<2408::aid-cncr2820621127>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],,,,,

A significant increase in mortality from leukaemia among cigarette smokers (relative risk 1.53) was found, together with a dose-response relation with amount smoked (trend p less than 0.001). The relation was strongest (relative risk 1.72) for monocytic and chronic and unspecified myeloid leukaemias (ICD (7th revision) codes 204.1 and 204.2). For these leukaemias the increase was almost twofold (relative risk 1.93) among current smokers of over 20 cigarettes daily.

In most cases of CML and some cases of Ph+ ALL the protooncogene ABL from 9q34 is translocated to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the BCR gene at 22q11 to form a chimeric gene encoding a novel 210-kd protein (P210 BCR-ABL) with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. In other patients with Ph+ ALL and Ph+ AML, the breakpoint probably occurs in the first intron of the BCR gene; this results in a smaller chimeric gene which encodes a P190 BCR-ABL. We studied a patient with AML (FAB M6) arising de novo who had a ""masked"" Ph chromosome in association with extensive karyotypic changes. The leukemic cells initially showed rearrangement of the bcr, presence of a hybrid mRNA, and expression of the P210 BCR-ABL. These changes were absent in remission. These results support the concept that the BCR-ABL chimeric gene plays a crucial role in leukemogenesis but suggest that factors other than the position of the breakpoint in the BCR gene determine the lineage of the target cell for malignant transformation.","['Price, C M', 'Rassool, F', 'Shivji, M K', 'Gow, J', 'Tew, C J', 'Haworth, C', 'Goldman, J M', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Price CM', 'Rassool F', 'Shivji MK', 'Gow J', 'Tew CJ', 'Haworth C', 'Goldman JM', 'Wiedemann LM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Nov;72(5):1829-32.,"['Department of Haematology, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, London, England.']",['S0006-4971(20)79279-7 [pii]'],,,,,

Five patients, age 22, 35, 47, 56, 72 years, two females, three males, all with idiopathic SAA and normal cytogenetic analysis developed a refractory anaemia (RA) 7, 30, 48, 56, 142 months after diagnosis of SAA.

Three patients revealed a monosomy 7 during MDS and/or leukaemic phase. One patient died during RA phase without cytogenetic abnormalities. A pattern of evolution could be identified in these patients revealing well-documented SAA - improvement of bone marrow haematopoiesis - dyshaematopoietic features of one or more cell lines with predominance of dyserythropoiesis - RA - RAEB or CMML - AML. These five patients represent more than 10% of all patients surviving at least 2 years.

This is largely due to the fact that cytogenetic analysis of direct marrow preparations cannot distinguish between the presence of Ph1-positive myeloid metaphases and infiltration of the marrow with dividing Ph1-positive blasts. Cytogenetic analysis of cultured haemopoietic colonies allows more precise lineage assignment. We have used this approach to study five adult patients who presented with Ph1-positive ALL and subsequently showed a significant increase in normal metaphases (to 18-100% of all metaphases examined) following remission induction. In four of these five patients, some Ph1-positive erythroid and granulopoietic cells could be demonstrated. In the other, as in three patients with childhood ALL who presented with a Ph1-negative but cytogenetically abnormal clone, only chromosomally normal erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors were detected. Two Ph1-positive CML patients who entered a lymphoid blast crisis following a recognized chronic phase were also studied. In both of these latter two patients all erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage colonies analysed were Ph1-positive. These findings support the concept that patients presenting with Ph1-positive ALL comprise a heterogeneous group. In some cases the disease may arise in a restricted lymphopoietic cell not capable of myelopoietic differentiation. However, in others involvement of myeloid cells suggests these may be variant forms of CML in spite of an unusual initial response of the Ph1-positive clone to therapy.","['Kalousek, D K', 'Dube, I D', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Kalousek DK', 'Dube ID', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Sep;70(1):5-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02426.x.,"['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Cytogenetic analysis showed a clonal 12p anomaly in one of the three cases available for study. Survival was poor with a median of 15 months, bleeding and infections being responsible for the majority of deaths.

Peripheral blood lymphoid cells have been investigated longitudinally (each 1 to 4 months) during complete remission (CR), by morphologic, phenotypic and functional analyses. Particular attention has been paid to the evaluation of the natural killer (NK) cell compartment, by the detection of cells expressing an NK-related phenotype and by NK in vitro assay. Among the patients so far evaluable, 20 relapsed (R) and 10 are long survivors in CR 'off therapy' (LS). The most relevant finding was represented by statistically higher values of NK activity observed in LS vs. R patients (P less than 0.01). The removal of adherent cells before the NK assay, performed to investigate the possible inhibitory effect on NK function played by the macrophage component, abolished this difference, due to a selective increase of NK function in the R group. The longitudinal study revealed that NK activity tended to decrease in individual patients who subsequently relapsed. These data suggest a possible role of NK cells in the relapse control of ANLL, although it cannot be excluded that the low level of NK activity observed in the R group is the result of impending relapse rather than its cause.","['Pizzolo, G', 'Trentin, L', 'Vinante, F', 'Agostini, C', 'Zambello, R', 'Masciarelli, M', 'Feruglio, C', 'Dazzi, F', 'Todeschini, G', 'Chilosi, M']","['Pizzolo G', 'Trentin L', 'Vinante F', 'Agostini C', 'Zambello R', 'Masciarelli M', 'Feruglio C', 'Dazzi F', 'Todeschini G', 'Chilosi M', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1988 Sep;58(3):368-72. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1988.221.,"['Cattedra di Ematologia, University of Verona, Italy.']",['10.1038/bjc.1988.221 [doi]'],,PMC2246608,,,

The relative steady-state concentration of these two tRNAs (relative to the total tRNA population) was measured by aminoacylation. The results show that while the relative steady-state concentration of tRNA(iMet) changes very little in the cytoplasmic tRNA population, the relative concentration of tRNA(Asn) decreases during the first two days of differentiation and then undergoes an increase. This difference in the behavior of these two tRNAs is also seen when their relative concentrations in newly synthesized tRNA is examined. When tRNA is labeled with tritiated uridine for 24 h in vivo prior to isolation, the hybridization of this labeled tRNA to filter-bound tRNA genes shows that the relative concentration of tRNA(iMet) in newly synthesized tRNA changes very little, while the relative concentration of newly synthesized tRNA(Asn) again decreases through the first 2 days of differentiation, and then undergoes a smaller increase. Thus, the production of these two tRNAs appears to be independently regulated. Independent regulation of synthesis is also observed when examining the production of these two tRNAs in isolated nuclei. During erythroid differentiation, the relative synthesis of tRNA(iMet) (relative to total nuclear RNA synthesis) remains constant, while the relative synthesis of tRNA(Asn) undergoes periodic increases and decreases in value.","['Kleiman, L', 'Schmedt, E', 'Miller, H']","['Kleiman L', 'Schmedt E', 'Miller H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Asn)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer, Asn/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer, Met/*biosynthesis']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1988 Jul;66(7):772-9.,"['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

In mouse cells, as determined by SDS--one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the most prominent hsps have molecular masses of approximately 89,000, 70,000, and 68,000 Da. When the heat-shock response of the mouse erythroleukemia cell line D1B, or two other DBA/2 cell lines (707C1 and 745C2), was examined by [35S]methionine labelling, following heat shocks of 10 min at 42 or 44 degrees C, or 1 h at 45 degrees C, no protein band corresponding to hsp 68 was observed. However, the synthesis of both hsp 89 and hsp 70 was enhanced. Northern blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNA extracted from control and stressed cells indicated that hsp 68 mRNA was absent, even after stresses of up to 1 h at 45 degrees C. Differentiation induced by dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (monitored by the induction of globin synthesis) had no effect on hsp 68 expression in D1B cells; also, hsp 68 could not be induced at various stages of differentiation (0-72 h). Southern blot analysis showed that all three hsp-68 genes were present and not rearranged, and apparently did not carry any deletion in their 5' ends. To determine whether methylation could be involved in maintaining the genes in their silent state, we treated cells with 10 microM 5-azacytidine for 48 h. No hsp 68 expression was observed following such treatment in either undifferentiated or DMSO-induced differentiated D1B cells. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of MspI/HpaII-digested genomic D1B DNA did not display any differences in methylation patterns around the promoter region of the probed gene compared with control cells, indicating that methylation is not involved in hsp-68 repression. When chimeric plasmids carrying the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene under regulation of the mouse hsp-68 or Drosophila hsp-70 promoters were transfected into D1B cells, minimal (2-fold) or no induction was observed, in contrast with the 60-fold induction seen in a control myeloma cell line. These results suggest a trans-acting mechanism of hsp-68 repression in erythroleukemia cells.","['Aujame, L']",['Aujame L'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Stress, Physiological/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1988 Jul;66(7):691-701. doi: 10.1139/o88-079.,"[""Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont., Canada.""]",['10.1139/o88-079 [doi]'],,,,,

Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells are particularly sensitive to this cytotoxic action. In this report we show that when HL-60 cells are differentiated into a granulocytic form by dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO)they become resistant toward the cytotoxic effects of alkylmethoxy-GPC. Also, after short-term exposures of the HL-60 cells to alkylmethoxy-GPC, the uptake of [methyl-3H]choline is inhibited in the undifferentiated cells, but not in those differentiated with Me2SO. Thus, cellular choline uptake appears to be a useful index for assessing the susceptibility of cells to the cytotoxic effects of antitumor phospholipids. [3H]Alkylmethoxy-GPC is poorly metabolized by both cell populations as is evident by the trace quantities of labeled metabolites formed; also, alkylmethoxyglycerols do not exert any cytotoxic activity toward undifferentiated cells. These results demonstrate that differences in the cytotoxic response of sensitive (undifferentiated) and resistant (differentiated) cells to alkylmethoxy-GPC are not due to differences in their ability to metabolize alkylmethoxy-GPC or to a phospholipase C-generated toxic metabolite. Instead the data support our earlier hypothesis that the antitumor action of alkylmethoxy-GPC is, at least in part, caused by an impaired transport of small molecules across the membrane of sensitive cells.","['Vallari, D S', 'Smith, Z L', 'Snyder, F']","['Vallari DS', 'Smith ZL', 'Snyder F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipid Ethers/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1988/10/14 00:00,1988/10/14 00:01,['1988/10/14 00:00'],"['1988/10/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/14 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1988 Oct 14;156(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(88)80797-6.,"['Medical and Health Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Tennessee 37831.']","['S0006-291X(88)80797-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(88)80797-6 [doi]']",,,,,

The increased enzyme content was due to a decreased rate of degradation of the protein and to an increased rate of synthesis, but there was no change in its mRNA content. The inhibitors led to a substantial decline in the amounts of intracellular spermidine and spermine, but to a big increase in the amount of putrescine. These results indicate that the content of ODC is negatively regulated by spermidine and spermine at the levels of protein translation and turnover, but that putrescine is much less effective in bringing about this repression. Addition of either spermidine or spermine to the cells treated with the AdoMetDC inhibitors led to a decrease in ODC activity, indicating that either polyamine can bring about this effect, but spermidine produced effects at concentrations similar to those found in the control cells and appears to be the physiologically important regulator. The content of AdoMetDC protein (measured by radioimmunoassay) was also increased by these inhibitors, and a small increase in its mRNA content was observed, but this was insufficient to account for the increase in protein. A substantial stabilization of AdoMetDC occurred in these cells, contributing to the increased enzyme content, but an increase in the rate of translation cannot be ruled out.","['Madhubala, R', 'Secrist, J A 3rd', 'Pegg, A E']","['Madhubala R', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Pegg AE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', ""112621-39-3 (5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methyl-N-(2-(aminooxy)ethyl)amino)adenosine)"", ""112621-42-8 (5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methyl-N-(3-hydrazinopropyl)amino)adenosine)"", '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1988 Aug 15;254(1):45-50. doi: 10.1042/bj2540045.,"['Department of Physiology, Milton S.

Those are decreased cell permeability, increased synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is the target enzyme of MTX, decreased polyglutamation of MTX, and decreased binding capacity of MTX to DHFR. Recent basic studies revealed that an increase of DHFR synthesis is the result of a proportional amplification of DHFR gene, and that polyglutamation of MTX plays an important role in its action. High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) therapy has a good rationale for overcoming MTX resistance.

Intra-operative ligation of the splenic artery through the lesser sac is a technically useful method of gaining vascular control prior to mobilizing the challenging spleen. However, a massive or inaccessible spleen imposes mechanical limitations during surgery and may be complicated by torrential intra-operative hemorrhage in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia refractile to platelet transfusions. The authors describe pre-operative intravascular proximal splenic artery control in four adult patients (3 men, 1 woman) with extreme splenomegaly (2,250-10,000 g). The massive splenomegaly in this group resulted from chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2), isolated splenic lymphoma (n = 1), and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (n = 1). Chief symptom manifestations included left upper quadrant abdominal pain, early satiety, post-prandial emesis, dyspnea, petechiae, and associated easy bruising. Prior to surgery, all the patients were taken to the radiology suite where either detachable silastic balloons or stainless steel coils were placed selectively into the splenic artery under fluoroscopic guidance requiring approximately 35 minutes. Splenic artery occlusion aided normalization of thrombocytopenia (average increases 19,000/microliter to 215,000/microliter) with prolongation in survival of platelets. Successful splenectomy was subsequently performed with no additional transfusion requirements and was made technically easier by reducing splenic bulk. There were no adverse consequences of intravascular occlusion and no peri-operative morbidity or mortality. Preoperative intravascular selective splenic artery occlusion, used as an important potential adjunct to anticipated high risk splenectomy, is recommended.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fujitani, R M', 'Johs, S M', 'Cobb, S R', 'Mehringer, C M', 'White, R A', 'Klein, S R']","['Fujitani RM', 'Johs SM', 'Cobb SR', 'Mehringer CM', 'White RA', 'Klein SR']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,,IM,"['Adult', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Splenectomy', '*Splenic Artery']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am Surg. 1988 Oct;54(10):602-8.,"['Department of Surgery, Los Angeles County-Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence 90509.']",,,,,,

Only 106 (50%) of the children could be treated. An initial hematologic remission was attained in 61 (58%) with a median duration of hematologic remission of 7.5 months and median survival of 12 months. Five patients who completed 36 months of therapy are still in initial remission, less than or equal to 84 months. Exophthalmos at presentation, which is clearly related to shorter duration of remission, was observed in 11% of these children. In two cases, it was the first sign of leukemia, 6 and 7 months prior to obvious bone marrow involvement. Twenty percent of the 61 patients who achieved remission discontinued their chemotherapy during the course of treatment while they were in remission, which indicates a different problem in the treatment of these patients in Turkey. Despite administration of similar treatment protocols, the prognosis of our patients was worse than the results observed in developed countries. We conclude that poor socioeconomic and nutritional conditions should also be considered among the high-risk factors for children with ANLL, as experienced in our patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).","['Hicsonmez, G', 'Gurgey, A', 'Zamani, V P', 'Yetgin, S', 'Altay, C', 'Ozsoylu, S']","['Hicsonmez G', 'Gurgey A', 'Zamani VP', 'Yetgin S', 'Altay C', 'Ozsoylu S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Turkey']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1988 Fall;10(3):268-72. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198823000-00017.,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['10.1097/00043426-198823000-00017 [doi]'],,,,['Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Summer;12(2):241-3.

We describe two pancytopenic patients with polymicrobial gram-negative bacteremia and fulminating gangrenous cellulitis. CASE REPORTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a localized hemorrhagic area of the face in one patient. The chronology of infection in these two patients is documented in a series of dramatic color photographs. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the infections progressed relentlessly and both patients died. COMMENTS: We discuss the dilemma of establishing the correct diagnosis prior to the appearance of the characteristic cutaneous manifestations of hemorrhagic necrosis and gangrene. Once the diagnosis is established, surgical excision is universally recommended. Unfortunately, bleeding diatheses in pancytopenic patients with co-existing coagulation deficiencies pose logistic obstacles in urgent, real-life situations. The timing and conditions for surgery need to be elucidated in these patients. An approach to this infection is proposed. The utility of frozen-section biopsy of the involved tissue and computed tomographic scans of the involved area remains to be evaluated.","['Kusne, S', 'Eibling, D E', 'Yu, V L', 'Fitz, D', 'Johnson, J T', 'Kahl, L E', 'Ellis, L D']","['Kusne S', 'Eibling DE', 'Yu VL', 'Fitz D', 'Johnson JT', 'Kahl LE', 'Ellis LD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/complications', 'Cellulitis/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Gangrene/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Pancytopenia/*complications', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*complications/diagnosis/therapy']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Oct;85(4):490-4. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80083-4.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261.']","['S0002-9343(88)80083-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80083-4 [doi]']",,,,,

After diagnosis, the height SD score decreased significantly in both groups; two years after the end of treatment, only group 1 showed an SD score for height that was still significantly lower than at diagnosis. Group 1 showed impaired GH responses to the tests and, compared with controls, group 1 in fact included a percentage of subjects with a normal response to levodopa (ie, greater than 8 micrograms/L) that was significantly lower (56.4% vs 83.3%) and a percentage of nonresponders to both tests that was significantly higher (21.6% vs 0%).

Biopsy or postmortem material available in two cases revealed malignant infiltration of lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lungs, intestines, and skin. The neoplastic cells ranged from cells with irregular nuclei possessing nuclear grooves to large blastic cells with round to lobulated nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They showed weak staining for acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterase and exhibited the immunophenotype EBM11+KiM1+KiM6+KiM8+CD4+HLADR+ S-100 protein+.

The Kiel classification was chosen for the histology. Accordingly, hairy-cell leukemia (14 cases) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (12 cases) were the most frequent diagnoses, followed by LP immunocytoma and centroblastic-centrocytic lymphoma (seven cases each). In four out of the 20 clinical pictures which were not already generalized by definition, i.e. in 20% of the cases, exploratory laparotomy resulted in a change of stage (comprising two improvements and two deteriorations).

In the thymus, a population of radioresistant cells, which phenotypically resemble cortical thymocytes, but are unique in their expression of high levels of H-2Kk antigen, have been found to produce high levels of both ecotropic and MCF virus and have been implicated as a putative therapeutic target cell population of anti-viral treatment.

The flow cytometric parameter axial light loss, a measure of cell volume, decreases in cells exposed to 5 microM TBT relative to control cells or cells exposed to 50 microM TBT. The flow cytometric parameter 90 degrees light scatter, a function of refractive index and a measure of protein content, increases as a function of TBT concentration above 0.5 microM. Following exposure to TBT concentrations greater than 0.5 microM, but less than 50 microM, DNA distribution across the cell cycle cannot be resolved adequately by flow cytometry. Also, the cells become resistant to solubilization of the cell membrane/cytoplasm complex by nonionic detergents. Relative to logarithmically growing cells, MELC in the stationary phase of the growth cycle and butyric acid-differentiated cells exhibit decreased plasma membrane permeability resulting in increased carboxyfluorescein (CF) retention derived from the intracellular hydrolysis of carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA). Similarly, cells exposed to TBT concentrations below 50 microM exhibit increased cellular CF retention. Viability in terms of CFDA hydrolysis/CF retention and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion is not decreased by exposure to TBT concentrations below 1 microM. At doses between 5 and 50 microM, however, cells exhibit both CF and PI fluorescence simultaneously and are programmed for death. At TBT concentrations greater than 1.0 microM, MELC plasma membrane potential, measured with the cyanine dye, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) decreases at the same time that the uptake of PI is observed. In conjunction with other data, the concentration-dependent increase in CF fluorescence, resistance to detergent-mediated solubilization of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex, and increase in 90 degrees light scatter suggest fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, etc.) as a mechanism of the toxic action of TBT.","['Zucker, R M', 'Elstein, K H', 'Easterling, R E', 'Massaro, E J']","['Zucker RM', 'Elstein KH', 'Easterling RE', 'Massaro EJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Trialkyltin Compounds)', '4XDX163P3D (tributyltin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Light', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Trialkyltin Compounds/*toxicity']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 1988 Oct;43(1-3):201-18. doi: 10.1016/0378-4274(88)90029-x.,"['Northrop Services, Inc., Environmental Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']","['0378-4274(88)90029-X [pii]', '10.1016/0378-4274(88)90029-x [doi]']",,,,,

Value of the study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid].,1202-8,"During a period of 16 months 26 fluid specimens obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in 24 immunocompromised patients were examined. This material included 13 HIV positive patients and 11 patients presenting malignant hemopathies (MH), of whom 7 had had a blood marrow transplantation. The BAL fluid was divided into two equal parts, one of which was sent to the Institute of Pathology and the other to the Laboratory of Bacteriology of Geneva University Hospital. In some cases a transbronchial biopsy was also studied. Eight out of 13 HIV positive patients presented a Pneumocystis carinii infection and one a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (associated with atypical mycobacteria infection). In another case streptococcal pneumonia was observed. In 3 patients, analysis of the BAL fluid failed to yield a diagnosis. In the 11 patients with MH, 2 cases of CMV, 2 infections with Candida albicans and one with Aspergillus fumigatus were found. In 2 patients the pneumopathy was due to bacterial infection. Four BAL fluids failed to yield a diagnosis; however, in one of these transbronchial biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonia of unknown origin. On the basis of our material and comparison with clinica, radiological and serological data, it appears that BAL fluid analysis is a helpful and rapid diagnostic aid in infectious pneumopathies of immunocompromised patients. This is especially true of AIDS patients in whom the most common pulmonary complication is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However, success of the analysis requires close cooperation between clinician, bacteriologist and pathologist.","['Konfino, S O', 'Auckenthaler, R', 'Kapanci, Y']","['Konfino SO', 'Auckenthaler R', 'Kapanci Y']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Pneumopathies infectieuses des immunodeprimes.

Nude mice, implanted with tumors, supplied the tumor material, with the exception of leukemia. Nimustine, melphalan, mitomycin C, vincristine and vinblastine were tested. Tumor cells developed karyorrhectic changes after incubation for 4 h with each of the aforementioned five drugs. An increase in the karyorrhectic changes was observed with hyperthermia at 43 degrees C. The individual tumors showed different sensitivities to 43 degrees C. Five of the eight tumors were significantly sensitive to 43 degrees C. However, in two thermosensitive tumors no drug enhancement was recognized at 43 degrees C. In four tumors several drugs were synergistically enhanced by hyperthermia at 43 degrees C.

Repair.,566-75,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DNA and chromosome repair in determining the difference in radiosensitivity between a radiosensitive murine leukemic lymphoblastoid cell line, L5178Y-S, and its radioresistant counterpart, L5178Y-R. Populations of cells in the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle were obtained by centrifugal elutriation and irradiated with X-ray doses up to 10 Gy and allowed to repair at 37 degrees C for various periods. The kinetics of DNA double-strand break repair was estimated using the DNA neutral filter elution method, and the kinetics of chromosome repair was measured by premature chromosome condensation. L5178Y-S cells exhibited decreased repair rates and limited repair capacity at both the DNA and chromosome level in both G1 and G2 phases when compared to L5178Y-R cells. For the repair-competent L5178Y-R cells, the rate of DNA repair was similar in G1 and G2 cells and exhibited both fast and slow components. While the kinetics of chromosome break repair in G1 cells was similar to that of DNA repair, chromosome repair in G2 cells had a diminished fast component and lagged behind DNA repair in terms of fraction of damage repaired. Interestingly, concomitant with a diminished repair capacity in L5178Y-S cells, the number of chromatid exchanges in G2 cells increased with time, whereas it remained constant with repair time in L5178Y-R cells. These results suggest that the basis for the exceptional radiosensitivity of L5178Y-S cells is a defect in the repair of both DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome damage.","['Wlodek, D', 'Hittelman, W N']","['Wlodek D', 'Hittelman WN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/*radiation effects', 'DNA/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Interphase', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 Sep;115(3):566-75.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

Initial damage.,550-65,"We investigated the role of initial DNA and chromosome damage in determining the radiosensitivity difference between the variant murine leukemic lymphoblast cell lines L5178Y-S (sensitive) and L5178Y-R (resistant) and the difference in cell cycle-dependent variations in radiosensitivity of L5178Y-S cells. We measured initial DNA damage (by the neutral filter elution method) and chromosome damage (by the premature chromosome condensation method) and compared them with survival (measured by cloning) for both cell lines synchronized in G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle (by centrifugal elutriation) and irradiated with low doses of X rays (up to 10 Gy). The initial yield of DNA and chromosome damage in G2 L5178Y-S cells was almost twice that in G1 L5178Y-S cells and G1 or G2 L5178Y-R cells. In all cases DNA damage expressed as relative elution corresponded with chromosome damage (breaks in G1 chromosomes, breaks and gaps in G2 chromosomes). Also we found that the initial DNA and chromosome damage did not determine cell age-dependent radiosensitivity variations in L5178Y-S cells, as there was less initial damage in the more sensitive G1 phase than in the G2 phase. L5178Y-R cells showed only small changes in survival or initial yield of DNA and chromosome damage throughout the cell cycle. Because survival and initial damage in sensitive and resistant cells irradiated in G2 phase correlated, the difference in radiosensitivity between L5178Y-S and L5178Y-R cells might be determined by initial damage in G2 phase only.","['Wlodek, D', 'Hittelman, W N']","['Wlodek D', 'Hittelman WN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*radiation effects', 'DNA/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Interphase/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 Sep;115(3):550-65.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

In this paper, we identify two cis-acting sequence elements needed for regulation by p27rex: a 5' splice signal and a specific sequence in the 3' LTR. These two sequence elements are sufficient for regulation by p27rex; expression of a cellular gene (metallothionein I) became sensitive to rex regulation when the LTR was inserted at the 3' end of this gene. The requirement for these two elements suggests an unusual regulatory mechanism of RNA processing in the nucleus.","['Seiki, M', 'Inoue, J', 'Hidaka, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Seiki M', 'Inoue J', 'Hidaka M', 'Yoshida M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Plasmids', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Splicing', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Oct;85(19):7124-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.19.7124.,"['Department of Viral Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['10.1073/pnas.85.19.7124 [doi]'],,PMC282136,,,

The mice were inoculated with the acute lymphocytic P388 leukemic cells and treated with the anticancer drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cis-Pt. Kidneys and spleens of control animals display four relaxation components. The two longest ones were assigned, in the kidneys, in decreasing order of their relaxation time value, to intracellular and extracellular water, respectively. In spleens, the reversed assignment resulted. The two shortest ones are assigned to different tightly bound hydration water compartments, the fastest relaxing one being more greatly influenced by the unobservable crystalline water. No significant systemic effect on the intra- and extracellular water relaxation times could be observed in the kidneys under P388 leukemia inoculation, despite an apparent increase in the intracellular water content. In contrast, drug administration results in the apparent decrease in or even disappearance of the extracellular water component, with an increase in both relaxation time and apparent fraction of the intracellular water. These effects correlate well with changes in the usual nephrotoxicity parameters and are explained in terms of the well-known cell damage in kidneys under cis-platinum administration. A systemic effect under P388 leukemia disease is observed for the spleen, resulting again in the disappearance of the extracellular water component. The latter is related to splenomegaly due to invasion of the organ by leukemic cells during disease development.","['Francois, A', 'Van Gerven, L', 'Atassi, G', 'Eisendrath, H', 'Gielen, M', 'Willem, R']","['Francois A', 'Van Gerven L', 'Atassi G', 'Eisendrath H', 'Gielen M', 'Willem R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Magn Reson Med,Magnetic resonance in medicine,8505245,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Body Water/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/*metabolism']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Magn Reson Med. 1988 Aug;7(4):449-62. doi: 10.1002/mrm.1910070408.,"['Laboratorium voor Vaste Stof Fysica en Magnetisme, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",['10.1002/mrm.1910070408 [doi]'],,,,,

BM, highly enriched for progenitor cells by depletion of mature hematopoietic elements, was further separated by sterile sorting into HLA-DR (-), low, intermediate, and high intensity HLA-DR (+), as well as HLA-DP (+) and HLA-DP (-) cell fractions and assayed for progenitor cell content. In addition, in the case of HLA-DR, CFU-GM response to inhibition by prostaglandin E was determined. Cell sorting and cytotoxicity data confirm that approximately 95% of assayable erythroid, myeloid, and multipotential progenitor cells expressed HLA-DR, whereas HLA-DQ Ags were undetectable. HLA-DR and HLA-DP Ags were co-expressed on 61% of these progenitor cells, predominantly those expressing HLA-DR at high intensity. Day 7 and 14 CFU-GM showed a trend toward segregation to the high HLA-DR (+) cell fractions, especially when recombinant human G-CSF was used to stimulate clone formation. Both day 7 and day 14 CFU-GMs were found predominantly in the HLA-DP (+) cell fraction. In contrast, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were found in the low intensity HLA-DR cell fraction and predominantly in the HLA-DP (-) fraction. Both eosinophil CFU and cells giving rise to basophil/mast cells in suspension culture were found in the low and intermediate intensity HLA-DR fractions, but could be segregated into HLA-DP (+) and HLA-DP (-) cell fractions, respectively. Functional analysis of day 7 CFU-GM segregated, based upon HLA-DR intensity, indicated a positive correlation between increasing HLA-DR intensity and responsiveness to inhibition by prostaglandin E. Furthermore, only those CFU-GM expressing HLA-DR at high intensity could be removed by cytolytic treatment using a mAb anti-HLA-DR previously shown to be selective for CFU-GM responsive to PGE and in S phase of the cell cycle.","['Ottmann, O G', 'Nocka, K H', 'Moore, M A', 'Pelus, L M']","['Ottmann OG', 'Nocka KH', 'Moore MA', 'Pelus LM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*physiology', 'Humans']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Oct;2(10):677-86.,"['Department of Hematopoietic Regulation, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10021.']",,['CA 33225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

In contrast, no bcr rearrangement could be found in DNA from 17 normal individuals and 28 patients with various hematologic disorders other than CML or ALL. An analysis of the location of the breakpoints within the bcr indicated that 3' breakpoints were significantly more common in patients in blast crisis or accelerated phase disease compared to those with chronic phase disease. Patients with chronic phase disease and 3' breakpoints had shorter average disease duration than that for chronic phase patients with 5' breakpoints, although the difference between these two groups of patients was not statistically significant. For patients who had progressed to accelerated disease or blast crisis, a statistically significant difference in chronic phase disease duration could be demonstrated between 11 patients with 3' breakpoints (average chronic phase 30.2 months) and 15 patients with 5' breakpoints (average chronic phase 50.6 months). For 8 patients studied in both chronic phase and accelerated or blast crisis, the location of the breakpoint did not change. We suggest that the bcr-abl fusion protein associated with a 3' breakpoint could result in more rapid progression to acute disease, and this may account for differences in the relative frequency of 3' and 5' breakpoints at different disease stages. Although more studies are required, identifying CML patients with a higher propensity for early blast transformation may eventually prove to be of some clinical value.","['Eisenberg, A', 'Silver, R', 'Soper, L', 'Arlin, Z', 'Coleman, M', 'Bernhardt, B', 'Benn, P']","['Eisenberg A', 'Silver R', 'Soper L', 'Arlin Z', 'Coleman M', 'Bernhardt B', 'Benn P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Time Factors']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Oct;2(10):642-7.,"['Lifecodes Corporation, Valhalla, NY 10595.']",,,,,,

An example is the consistent fusion of the bcr gene to the c-abl oncogene on the Ph chromosome in CML. The Ph chromosome can also be observed in ALL. About 50% of Ph+ ALL cases, in contrast to CML, do not exhibit chromosomal breakpoints in the major cluster region or mcr (Ph+ mcr- ALL). These cases may have a novel bcr-abl fusion gene instead. We tested this hypothesis in eight Ph+ mcr- ALL patients by amplifying the putative hybrid part of the bcr-abl cDNA, using the polymerase chain reaction method. All cases examined showed the same joining of the first exon of the bcr gene to the c-abl oncogene. Thus, the novel bcr-abl fusion in Ph+ mcr- ALL is the result of a molecularly distinct Ph chromosome. This allows the definition of Ph+ leukemias by their respective bcr-abl oncogene activation.

Cell-free culture media conditioned by all but two of the seven types of monolayer studied inhibited haemoglobin synthesis by K562 cells; those conditioned by blood-monocyte-derived macrophages and two of 11 monolayers of bone-marrow-derived macrophages stimulated haemoglobin synthesis. Thus, the haemoglobin content of K562 cells appeared to be influenced both by intimate contact between K562 cells and the cells of the monolayers and by humoral factors released by the monolayers. The data support the concept that erythroid differentiation is partly dependent on intimate contact between erythroid progenitor cells and microenvironmental cells.","['Zuhrie, S R', 'Pearson, J D', 'Wickramasinghe, S N']","['Zuhrie SR', 'Pearson JD', 'Wickramasinghe SN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",IM,"['Amniotic Fluid/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Neuroglia/physiology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(7):567-74. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90086-0.,"[""Department of Haematology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, U.K.""]",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90086-0 [doi]'],,,,,

The induction of the exogenous c-myc gene expression inhibited the commitment of these cells. Time-dependent inhibition of the commitment was observed with the addition of zinc at an appropriate time after the induction with dimethyl sulfoxide. The result clearly indicated that late decline, not early decline, is required for the commitment. By examining the transformants expressing the exogenous c-myc mRNA at different levels, and the induction of the exogenous c-myc mRNA by varying the concentration of zinc, we demonstrated that the commitment may be determined by a stoichiometric amount of c-myc in the defined period.

(a) Treatment of allogeneic adult C57B1/6 or C3H mice with polyclonal antibody to mouse IFN-alpha/beta (but not antibody to IFN-gamma) completely abrogated the resistance to the multiplication of FLC in the liver and 87% of tumor-injected, antibody-treated C57B1/6 mice died with extensive tumor involvement of the liver. In contrast, after intravenous inoculation FLC do not multiply at all (or very rarely) in the liver of adult C57B1/6 mice left untreated or treated with a variety of control globulins, and no deaths occurred.

IFN-alpha/beta appears to be of particular importance in determining the resistance of the liver to FLC in allogeneic mice.","['Gresser, I', 'Maury, C', 'Vignaux, F', 'Haller, O', 'Belardelli, F', 'Tovey, M G']","['Gresser I', 'Maury C', 'Vignaux F', 'Haller O', 'Belardelli F', 'Tovey MG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Mx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Serum Globulins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antiviral Agents/genetics/immunology', 'DNA Probes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Serum Globulins/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Oct 1;168(4):1271-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.4.1271.,"[""Laboratory of Viral Oncology, Groupe de Laboratoires de l'Institut de Recherches, Scientifiques sur le Cancer, Villejuif, France.""]",['10.1084/jem.168.4.1271 [doi]'],,PMC2189088,,,

This action is associated with a large reduction in RNA synthesis, which precedes any decreases in protein or DNA synthesis, and is specific for rRNA relative to total polyadenylated RNA synthesis. A 70% reduction in rRNA synthesis occurs within 20 minutes of ACM treatment and by 30 hours of DMSO exposure. Relative to the amount of 28S and 18S rRNA in the cells, there is a nearly complete depletion of the amount of 45S rRNA and other large rRNA precursors in cells treated with ACM, MCM, and the intercalating agent actinomycin D. In contrast, DMSO treatment produces a more coordinated decrease in 18S and 28S rRNA and rRNA precursors. The anthracycline antibiotics inhibited the synthesis of 5' proximal and 3' distal regions of the pre-rRNA transcript, while actinomycin D had a relatively sparing effect on the transcription of the 5' external transcribed spacer region of the gene relative to depletion of 3' transcripts. These studies demonstrate that different inducers of HL-60 differentiation have varying sites of action on rRNA synthesis and/or processing, with depletion of cellular rRNA as a common consequence.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Nilson, L']","['Schwartz EL', 'Nilson L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 18S)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/metabolism']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Sep;136(3):526-30. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041360319.,"['Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467.']",['10.1002/jcp.1041360319 [doi]'],,,,,

The present study conclusively identifies p93 as the c-fes proto-oncogene product and shows that expression of p93c-fes and its associated tyrosine kinase activity are marked in mature granulocytes, monocytes, and human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Antisera to peptides obtained by expression of c-fes cDNA fragments in Escherichia coli reacted strongly with p93 purified from HL-60 cells. Western blots using one of these antisera demonstrated high levels of p93c-fes protein in normal human granulocytes and monocytes, as well as the cell lines KG-1, THP-1, HEL, and U-937, all of which can be induced to differentiate along the myelomonocytic pathway. Conversely, in cell lines resistant to myeloid differentiation, p93c-fes expression was either very low or absent. Expression of immunoreactive p93c-fes in these cell lines showed a strong positive correlation with p93c-fes tyrosine kinase activity, which was measured in cell extracts using a nondenaturing gel assay. Finally, the expression of p93c-fes, its tyrosine kinase activity, and the binding of 125I-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were all coordinately increased in HL-60 cells treated with the granulocytic differentiation inducer dimethyl sulfoxide, while all three parameters were low in untreated or differentiation-resistant HL-60 cells. These results suggest that expression of p93c-fes tyrosine kinase activity may be an essential component of myeloid differentiation and responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.","['Smithgall, T E', 'Yu, G', 'Glazer, R I']","['Smithgall TE', 'Yu G', 'Glazer RI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Oct 15;263(29):15050-5.,"['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['S0021-9258(18)68144-X [pii]'],,,,,

Radionuclides associated with the debris first were measured in precipitation and surface air particulates at Portland, OR and Olympia, WA on 5 May 1986. Iodine-131 was the most consistently measured nuclide in all media, although several Cs and Ru isotopes also were observed. Strontium and any actinides notably were absent from the samples at the lower level of detection. The highest calculated individual-organ dose due to intake during May and June 1986 was 0.52 mSv to the infant thyroid in the state of Washington. This was predominantly (98%) from the ingestion of milk. The maximum U.S. collective dose equivalent to any organ was calculated to be 3,300 person-Sv to the thyroid. Risk estimates project three excess lung cancer deaths and an additional four deaths due to cancers of thyroid, breast and leukemia in the U.S. population over the next 45 y from exposure during the May-June 1986 interval. The only long-lived radionuclide measured in milk samples following the accident was 137Cs. We estimate 20 excess fatalities from the ingestion of 137Cs in milk during all subsequent years, with six of these due to lung cancer and the majority of the remainder distributed approximately equally among cancers of the thyroid, breast, liver and leukemia. A total of 100 excess fatalities from all dietary components was estimated. Because of the uncertainty of risk estimates from data such as those available for this study, all calculated values carry a range of uncertainty from a minimum of one-half the calculated value to a maximum of two times the calculated value. The estimated excess fatalities given above may be compared with corresponding projected cancer mortality from all other causes: 41,000 fatalities from thyroid cancer and 3,800,000 fatalities from lung cancer are estimated to occur within the U.S. population during the next 45 y.","['Broadway, J A', 'Smith, J M', 'Norwood, D L', 'Porter, C R']","['Broadway JA', 'Smith JM', 'Norwood DL', 'Porter CR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioactive Fallout)', '0 (Radioactive Pollutants)']",IM,"['*Accidents', 'Animals', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Milk/analysis', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Fallout/*analysis', 'Radioactive Pollutants/analysis', 'Ukraine', 'United States']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 1988 Sep;55(3):533-9. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198809000-00004.,"['U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Radiation Programs, Eastern Environmental Radiation Facility, Montgomery, AL 36109.']",['10.1097/00004032-198809000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,

Focal areas of disaggregation of tumor cells were observed 1 hr after injection of TNF. Intraluminal thrombi (composed of degranulated platelets and fibrin) were detected 3 and 6 hr after TNF treatment, and were associated with areas of depletion of endothelial cell cytoplasm. To correlate these morphologic changes in the tumor with alterations in tumor metabolism, NMR spectroscopy and biochemical studies were undertaken on freshly dissected FLC tumors and fibrosarcomas shortly after injection of TNF. The earliest metabolic alterations observed after 1 hr in TNF-treated FLC tumors of fibrosarcomas were: (i) increase in the average intratumoral pH; (ii) decrease in the levels of ATP. These phenomena were not associated with a reduced glycolytic capacity of TNF-treated tumors as, at these early times after injection, the levels of lactic acid were virtually the same for TNF-treated or control treated tumors. Alterations in the levels of some products of phospholipid degradation (GroPCho, GroPEtn, GroP and Cho) also occurred in these tumors as early as 3 hr after TNF treatment.

In the presence of Moloney mouse leukemia virus (MLV), used as a helper, RHV is serially transmissible in mouse NIH-3T3 cells and can provide envelope antigens for vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype--VSV(RHV). This pseudotype is neutralizable with an inhibitor, present in all human sera tested; the inhibitory activity is resistant to heating at 100 degrees C. To detect whether any specific response to RHV is connected with the disease, we isolated IgG from 140 human sera (70 melanoma patients and 70 control group donors) and tested it for neutralization of VSV(RHV) pseudotype in a randomized, blind experiment. Sixteen samples of IgG from the sera of melanoma patients, but only one control IgG, neutralized the pseudotype; this difference was significant (p less than 0.001). RHV thus appears to be in some way associated with melanoma.","['Zavada, J', 'Zavadova, Z', 'Havrankova, M']","['Zavada J', 'Zavadova Z', 'Havrankova M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Defective Viruses/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Melanoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae/*immunology/isolation & purification']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;42(4):572-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910420418.,"['Institute of Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.']",['10.1002/ijc.2910420418 [doi]'],,,,,

In order to characterize some of the naturally-occurring L5178Y reactive antibodies we prepared hybridomas that secreted natural monoclonal IgM antibodies reactive with L5178Y lymphoma cells. In the present study we characterized some of these antibodies and provided further proof as to their role in urethane carcinogenesis. One hybridoma secreted a cytotoxic antibody that reacted only with mouse lymphoma cell lines. Other non-cytotoxic monoclonal L5178Y-reactive antibodies showed various degrees of cross-reactivity with syngeneic, allogeneic and xenogeneic cells of normal or malignant origin. One of these antibodies reacted much better with activated T cells than with resting ones. Four groups of mice were treated with urethane. Three groups were injected twice a week during 5 months with different IgM preparations of natural monoclonal antibodies. The mice in the fourth group were not treated with IgM and served as controls. Five months after the urethane treatment the mice were sacrificed and the number of tumor foci in the lungs of each mouse was determined. The results show that the group treated with the cytotoxic monoclonal antibody 1.80 had a significant decrease, while the group treated with the IgM myeloma protein 104E had a significant increase in the number of tumor foci compared to urethane-treated mice that did not receive any IgM treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Agassy-Cahalon, L', 'Yaakubowicz, M', 'Witz, I P', 'Smorodinsky, N I']","['Agassy-Cahalon L', 'Yaakubowicz M', 'Witz IP', 'Smorodinsky NI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3IN71E75Z5 (Urethane)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precancerous Conditions/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Urethane']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1988 Jul;18(3):181-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(88)90017-x.,"['Department of Microbiology, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']","['0165-2478(88)90017-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(88)90017-x [doi]']",,,,,

These cells were used as a model for the examination of morphological changes occurring during terminal erythroid differentiation. FVA cells differentiate more completely in vitro in response to EP than continuous erythroleukemia cell lines do in response to chemical induction. Because they can be isolated in much greater numbers and in much higher purity than bone marrow or spleen cells explanted from anemic mice, FVA cells are an attractive alternative for studies of mammalian terminal erythroid differentiation. FVA cells cultured with EP followed a sequence of differentiation events that included a progressive decrease in cell size, disappearance of nucleoli, condensation of nuclei, and accumulation of hemoglobin. After 45 h of culture most FVA cells enucleated, giving rise to vacuolated reticulocytes and free nuclei that were surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm and a plasma membrane. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic volumes increased significantly by 24 h of culture but did not change significantly from 24 through 36 h of culture. Variation in the morphology of enucleating FVA cells indicated that not all cells proceeded through a rigorously defined series of morphological stages prior to enucleation.

When in vivo BrdUrd infusion is coupled with bivariate flow cytometry to measure cell BrdUrd incorporation and DNA content, both the percentage of DNA-synthesizing cells [BrdUrd-labeling index (LI)] and the DNA synthesis time (TS) can be determined on the same tissue sample. From experimentally determined LI and TS, the potential doubling time of the population and its cell production rate are calculated. To ascertain whether the BrdUrd infusion method is clinically feasible and if data are reliable, we studied patients with leukemia, refractory anemia, multiple myeloma, and brain and gastric tumors. The BrdUrd incorporation data were compared with those determined on duplicate samples with the techniques conventionally used for LI and TS values, i.e., 3H- and 14C-labeled thymidine autoradiography, respectively. The complete BrdUrd procedure takes 6-9 h, and no immediate toxicity from BrdUrd administration has been observed. In an 8-month period, 154 patients were studied. Successful LI and TS determinations were obtained in 78.9 and 59.7% of cases, respectively, more often in hematological than in solid tumors. The values for LI and TS assessed with the BrdUrd technique were very close to those found with 3H- and 14C-labeled thymidine autoradiography (r = 0.88, P less than 0.005, and r = 0.89; P less than 0.005, respectively). The potential doubling time and production rate were accordingly similar.

The average age of these patients was 62 years. Eleven patients had either leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders (LEMP). The rest had lymphoma (LYMPH). The Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) in the LYMPH patients was 1015 +/- 115 kcal/24 hr. This value in the LEMP group was significantly elevated at 2083 +/- 270 kcal/24 hr (P less than 0.025) despite similar weights and ages between the two groups. Net Protein Catabolism (NPC) in the LYMPH group was 82 +/- 29 mg/kg.hr. In contrast the value in the LEMP group was more than doubled at 174 +/- 30 mg/kg.hr (P less than 0.05). Glucose production in the LYMPH group was 14.1 +/- 2.7 mumol/kg.min, and the percent of glucose uptake oxidized in the LYMPH group was 37% +/- 9%. In contrast, glucose production in the LEMP group was significantly elevated (P less than 0.025) at 41.0 +/- 8.1 mumol/kg.min, and the percent of glucose uptake oxidized was significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) at 20% +/- 4% compared with the value in the LYMPH group. Glucose recycling in the LYMPH group was 9.0% +/- 6%. In the LEMP group the rate of recycling was significantly elevated at 60.3% +/- 4.8% (P less than 0.005).

Possible implications for humans.,1463-5,"Recent data referring to the influence of a restricted diet on the incidence of radiation-induced tumors and leukemia in rats and mice are reviewed. The incidence of tumors developing in rats exposed to total-body gamma irradiation was reduced from 93% to 35% in female rats and from 59% to 7% in male rats after restriction of food intake. In a similar study carried out on mice, the incidence of leukemia in irradiated mice of both sexes was reduced from 50% to 4% after restriction of food intake. Radiation-induced leukemia in mice is caused by a transmissible virus activated by total-body gamma irradiation. In most of the animal species investigated thus far, tumors, leukemia, and lymphomas were found to be caused by transmissible viruses. It appears that activation of some of these latent viruses could be prevented by restriction of food intake. If the results of experiments carried out on mice and rats are extrapolated for humans, it would follow that all of us (particularly those who have had multiple cases of cancer or leukemia among family members) should aim at holding our weight below the limits considered normal for our age, sex, and height. This appears particularly important for persons that have been exposed to large doses of ionizing radiation.","['Gross, L']",['Gross L'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Animals', '*Diet, Reducing', 'Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/pathogenicity', 'Virus Activation']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;62(8):1463-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:8<1463::aid-cncr2820620802>3.0.co;2-b.,"['Cancer Research Unit, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10468.']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:8<1463::aid-cncr2820620802>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],,,,,

To investigate the basis for these differences, ricin binding to human hematopoietic cell lines was assessed and correlated with in vitro ricin sensitivities. Resistant mutants were also isolated and characterized. Ricin binding to CEM cells was rapid, time-dependent, and blocked by unlabeled ricin, but not albumin; ricin binding approached saturation at 3 mumol/L. Scatchard analyses showed multiple classes of binding sites, with maximum and minimum Kd values estimated at 1.5 x 10(-8) mol/L and 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/L. At 4 degrees C, membrane-bound ricin dissociated slowly from the cell surface in the presence of unlabeled ricin, but greater than 95% of the surface-bound ricin was removed with 0.1 mol/L lactose. At 37 degrees C, ricin dissociated from the cell surface with biphasic kinetics. Ricin uptake at 37 degrees C increased linearly for 15 to 30 minutes and plateaued at levels representing 12% to 29% of the amount of ricin bound at 4 degrees C, depending on the cell line. Ricin binding at 4 degrees C varied two- to fivefold among hematopoietic cell lines and was reduced approximately tenfold by incubation with lactose. When compared with parent CEM cells, ricin-resistant CEM variants showed a greater than 95% reduction in ricin binding and showed no detectable binding with lactose added. However, these cells were as sensitive as parent CEM cells to an anti-T-cell ricin immunoconjugate. For all cells examined, there was a close correlation (r = +.9) between ricin bound per cell and in vitro ricin sensitivity. Human hematopoietic cells show widely varying ricin binding, indicating major differences in the carbohydrate content or structure of surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. These variations are probably the major determinant of nonspecific toxicity of ricin immunoconjugates.","['Leonard, J E', 'Grothaus, C D', 'Taetle, R']","['Leonard JE', 'Grothaus CD', 'Taetle R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*analysis/drug effects', 'Ricin/*metabolism/toxicity']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Oct;72(4):1357-63.,"['UC San Diego Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['S0006-4971(20)82912-7 [pii]'],"['1 P01 CA 37497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R23 CA 35692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Indications for HDAC therapy were progressive pancytopenia in 13 patients or rising blast count in four. Five patients died of marrow hypoplasia following therapy. Four others had refractory t-ANLL and died within the subsequent 5 months. Only one of ten patients with a poor performance status (PS greater than or equal to 2 using the ECOG scale) achieved a complete remission, but all seven patients with a good performance status (PS less than or equal to 1) had a complete remission.

Patients in remission received one to four consolidation courses with HDAC alternating with cytarabine/doxorubicin, but seven relapsed within 8 months (median remission duration, 5 months). In every case, the original chromosomal abnormality reappeared at relapse.

Achievement of a second complete remission is the initial step in a successful retreatment effort. Reinduction results using two or three drugs have been unsatisfactory, and previous reports of four-drug reinduction programs have included relatively small numbers of patients. Pediatric Oncology Group protocol 8303 was designed for patients with ALL in first marrow relapse during or within 6 months after cessation of chemotherapy. The results of reinduction therapy in 297 study patients are described here. Four-drug reinduction therapy consisted of daily oral prednisone, weekly vincristine and daunorubicin, and asparaginase three times weekly for 4 weeks (PVDA). CNS retreatment consisted of two doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy. Of the 297 patients receiving reinduction, 245, or 82%, entered second complete remission, six died of infection or progressive disease, and 46 others still had M2 or M3 bone marrow status. Forty of these latter patients received four doses (during a 2-week period) of teniposide and cytarabine, after which 13 (32%) achieved complete remission status. Thus, the overall second complete remission rate with PVDA with or without teniposide/cytarabine was 258 of 297, or 87%. The treatment program was generally well tolerated. Among the numerous factors analyzed by using logistic regression, only female sex (P = .035), the presence of blasts on the blood smear at the time of relapse (P = .0002), and a length of initial complete remission less than 12 months (P = .021) were independent predictors of failure to enter second remission. We conclude that the intensive reinduction program described here is a highly effective first step in the delivery of salvage therapy to patients with ALL in first marrow relapse. The current challenge is to develop improved continuation treatment for these children.","['Buchanan, G R', 'Rivera, G K', 'Boyett, J M', 'Chauvenet, A R', 'Crist, W M', 'Vietti, T J']","['Buchanan GR', 'Rivera GK', 'Boyett JM', 'Chauvenet AR', 'Crist WM', 'Vietti TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Oct;72(4):1286-92.,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.']",['S0006-4971(20)82901-2 [pii]'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

Surprisingly, seven of 80 CML cases in chronic phase also showed rearrangements falling outside the bcr region. In two of these cases the breakpoint on chromosome 22 was mapped between 9 and 12 kb upstream to the bcr region. In another case, the breakpoint was located approximately 16 kb downstream to bcr.

The resistant cells demonstrated a 40% reduction in drug accumulation but a qualitatively similar profile of DNA-bound adducts. These adducts resembled those previously characterized in pure DNA and represented intrastrand cross-links at GG, AG, and GNG (N is any nucleotide) sequences in DNA. Repair of these cross-links occurred in a biphasic manner: rapid for the first 6 h and then much slower. The resistant cells removed up to 4 times as many adducts during the rapid phase of repair. The extent of this repair did not directly correlate with the degree of resistance in that cells with 100-fold resistance were only slightly more effective at repair than cells with 20-fold resistance.

Highly enriched populations of NK cells were obtained by a newly developed, single-step sheep red blood cell rosette assay. This method, which did not require any incubation steps to facilitate cell contact, permitted a rapid and efficient isolation of NK cells from adherent-cell-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes. The non-rosetted cells had high NK activity, possessed large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology and expressed the NK-associated antigens Leu-11a, Leu-7, OKM1 and NKH-1. In contrast, the rosetted cells had significantly lower NK activity, possessed typical lymphocyte morphology and expressed the T-cell-associated marker OKT3. Next, we examined the ability of these NK-enriched effector cells (ECc) to become inactivated by K562. Functional studies revealed that ECc lost greater than or equal to 95% of their lytic capacity following incubation with K562 at a ratio of 2/1 for 6 h. However, to achieve this level of inactivation, it was essential that the cell suspension be gently mixed every 90-120 min. Inactivation was not due to cell death and did not reflect changes in the percentages of cells bearing the Leu-11a, Leu-7, OKM1 and NKH-1 antigens, but was associated with an increase in cell surface concentration of OKM1. As judged by gross morphology, the percentages of LGL in ECc before and after treatment with K562 were essentially the same. Finally, K562-treated ECc also lost their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), suggesting that both NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and ADCC may involve a common lytic pathway.","['Abrams, S I', 'Brahmi, Z']","['Abrams SI', 'Brahmi Z']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Ann Inst Pasteur Immunol,Annales de l'Institut Pasteur.

Twelve out of 103 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed CNS leukemia in spite of prophylaxis consisting of intrathecal methotrexate. Ten out of 217 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) developed CNS leukemia. None had been given preventive treatment. Leukemic blasts with either M4 or M5 morphology appeared to increase the risk of CNS relapse. Treatment was adjusted to the clinical problem of each patient, but always included intrathecal methotrexate. Median survival after a diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 8 and 6 months in ALL and AML respectively, with bone marrow failure due to hematologic relapse as the leading cause of death. CNS leukemia, if properly treated, does probably not shorten survival. An active approach to diagnosis and treatment is therefore mandatory.","['Brinch, L', 'Evensen, S A', 'Stavem, P']","['Brinch L', 'Evensen SA', 'Stavem P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Sweden,Acta Med Scand,Acta medica Scandinavica,0370330,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Med Scand. 1988;224(2):173-8. doi: 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1988.tb16756.x.,"['Section of Hematology, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.']",['10.1111/j.0954-6820.1988.tb16756.x [doi]'],,,,,

Patients with nephrotoxicity tended to be older than patients without nephrotoxicity; gender and total amphotericin B dose were not related to nephrotoxicity. Sodium administration has previously been shown to reverse amphotericin B nephrotoxicity. In this series, among patients receiving ticarcillin at greater than or equal to 18 gm/day (93.6 mEq of sodium per day) the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly decreased (1/30, or 3.3%). A multivariate analysis showed that this protective effect of ticarcillin was not dependent on the fact that patients receiving ticarcillin were less likely to receive vancomycin. There were insufficient patients receiving sodium in the absence of ticarcillin to study the effect of sodium alone. However, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that sodium can prevent renal dysfunction in this clinical situation.","['Stein, R S', 'Albridge, K', 'Lenox, R K', 'Ray, W', 'Flexner, J M']","['Stein RS', 'Albridge K', 'Lenox RK', 'Ray W', 'Flexner JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'F93UJX4SWT (Ticarcillin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sodium/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Ticarcillin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vancomycin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,South Med J. 1988 Sep;81(9):1095-9. doi: 10.1097/00007611-198809000-00007.,"['Department of Medicine (Hematology), Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tenn.']",['10.1097/00007611-198809000-00007 [doi]'],"['CA 19429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-RR-5-2111/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

CFU-D from patients with neutrophilic leukemoid reaction (NLR) revealed a normal reactivity to colony-stimulating activity, whereas they were hyporesponsive to macrophage-derived indomethacin-sensitive inhibition. This altered response was correlated both with the concentration of granulocyte progenitors in the S phase and with blood neutrophilic leukocytosis.

The presenting characteristics, initial management, early complications, and outcome were reviewed. All the children received vigorous intravenous (IV) hydration, alkalinization of the urine, and allopurinol. Thirty-two patients were started on full therapy with no additional measure. One or more special measures believed to reduce the complications of leukostasis and blast cell lysis were administered to 92 patients as follows: small initial doses of prednisone, 63; emergency cranial irradiation, 26; exchange transfusion, 21; and leukopheresis, 19. The incidence of CNS hemorrhage was only 3% (4/124). Seven patients expired during induction and four failed to achieve a remission by day 28. Nineteen patients (15%) had documented bacterial or fungal sepsis. Mild to moderate electrolyte abnormalities occurred in 29 patients: three patients required renal dialysis. Pretreatment with small doses of prednisone did not decrease the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities in those patients when compared with patients who received full chemotherapy. The event-free survival (EFS) for the 106 patients treated on one of the three intensive pilot studies is 55% at 36 months. On multivariate analysis the two significant adverse prognostic factors were massive splenomegaly (P = .02) and WBC count greater than 600,000/microL (P = .05). In conclusion, in patients with hyperleukocytosis the complications of blast cell lysis and leukostasis were manageable with acceptable morbidity and minimal mortality in a group of patients treated with vigorous hydration, allopurinol, and alkalinization of the urine before beginning chemotherapy. Selected patients with severe hyperuricemia and renal dysfunction may benefit from leukopheresis. No beneficial role was demonstrated for the use of small initial doses of prednisone or emergency cranial irradiation.","['Maurer, H S', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Finklestein, J Z', 'Sather, H N', 'Reaman, G H', 'Bleyer, W A', 'Hammond, G D']","['Maurer HS', 'Steinherz PG', 'Gaynon PS', 'Finklestein JZ', 'Sather HN', 'Reaman GH', 'Bleyer WA', 'Hammond GD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Emergencies', 'Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood', 'Female', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/complications/therapy', 'Leukocytosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Statistics as Topic']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Sep;6(9):1425-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.9.1425.,"['University of Illinois, Chicago.']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.9.1425 [doi]'],"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

From 1971 to 1986, we made the diagnosis of CMML in 107 cases, according to FAB criteria (except for patients with 20% to 30% bone marrow [BM] blasts who were also included). Median survival was 30 months (range 1 to 81 months) and life expectancy did not seem to be influenced by treatment modalities other than supportive care. Eighteen patients (17%) progressed to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). In a Cox regression model, main factors associated with short survival were: an excess of marrow blasts (P = 10(-6], anemia (P = .17 x 10(-5], high peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (P = .26 x 10(-5], presence of PB blasts (P = .49 x 10(-4], and to a lesser extent hyperleukocytosis (P = .001), presence of PB immature granulocytes, thrombopenia, and splenomegaly. Survival (less than 1 year v greater than 1 year) could be predicted at diagnosis in a multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis using two parameters only (percentage of BM blasts and hemoglobin level), with 82% accuracy. Among patients surviving greater than 1 year, initial PB leukocyte count was higher in patients with intermediate survival (12 to 42 months) than in long survivors (greater than 42 months) and was the only discriminating factor between these two subgroups in multivariate analysis. Abnormal cytogenetic findings and increased lysozymuria were also poor prognostic factors, but could not be analyzed in the multivariate models, as they were determined in a minority of patients. Parameters associated with subsequent progression to ANLL included younger age at diagnosis, thrombopenia, increased BM blasts, and splenomegaly. Our study allows for the identification of subgroups with different prognoses in CMML, on the basis of a small number of hematologic parameters, particularly initial percentage of BM blasts, hemoglobin level, and leukocytosis. These subgroups probably require different therapeutic approaches.","['Fenaux, P', 'Beuscart, R', 'Lai, J L', 'Jouet, J P', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Beuscart R', 'Lai JL', 'Jouet JP', 'Bauters F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Sep;6(9):1417-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.9.1417.,"['Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Lille, France.']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.9.1417 [doi]'],,,,,

When attached to fibronectin-coated dishes MEL cells induce, upon addition of DMSO, a 7-d differentiation process during which they enucleate and reach the reticulocyte stage (Patel, V. P., and H. F. Lodish. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:3105-3118); they accumulate band 3, spectrin, and ankyrin in amounts equivalent to those found in mature red blood cells. To follow the biosynthesis of spectrin during differentiation, membranes and cytoskeletal proteins of cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine were solubilized by SDS and alpha and beta spectrins were recovered by specific immunoadsorption. In both uninduced and 3-d induced cells, the relative synthesis of alpha/beta spectrin is approximately 1:3. In uninduced MEL cells newly synthesized alpha and beta spectrins are degraded with a similar half-life of approximately 10 h. In contrast, in 3-d differentiated MEL cells newly made beta spectrin is much more unstable than alpha spectrin; the half-lives of alpha and beta spectrin chains are approximately 22 and 8 h, respectively. Thus, accumulation of equal amounts of alpha and beta spectrin is caused by unequal synthesis and unequal degradation. As judged by Northern blot analyses, the level of actin mRNA is relatively constant throughout the 7-d differentiation period. alpha and beta spectrin mRNAs are barely detectable in uninduced cells, increase during the first 4 d of induction, and remain constant thereafter. In contrast, band 3 mRNA is first detectable on day 4 of differentiation. Thus, most of the spectrin that accumulates in enucleating reticulocytes is synthesized during the last few days of erythropoiesis, concomitant with the onset of band 3 synthesis. To determine whether this was occurring in normal mouse erythropoiesis, we analyzed the rate of appearance of labeled membrane proteins in mature erythrocytes after a single injection of [35S]methionine. Our results show that most of the spectrin and band 3 in mature erythrocytes is synthesized during the last days of bone marrow erythropoiesis, and that, in the marrow, band 3 and protein 4.1 are synthesized at a somewhat later stage of development than are alpha and beta spectrin, ankyrin, and actin.","['Lehnert, M E', 'Lodish, H F']","['Lehnert ME', 'Lodish HF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Spectrin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1988 Aug;107(2):413-26. doi: 10.1083/jcb.107.2.413.,"['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']",['10.1083/jcb.107.2.413 [doi]'],['HL 27375/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2115221,,,

When the heme biosynthetic pathway was blocked by succinylacetone there was a large increase in both 5-aminolevulinate synthase activity and protein levels, and this was reversed by the addition of exogenous hemin. Transcriptional activity of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene and mRNA levels were both significantly increased during differentiation of cells by dimethyl sulfoxide but were not markedly altered by succinylacetone or hemin treatment. The results demonstrate that levels of 5-aminolevulinate synthase in mouse erythroleukemic cells are regulated by a significant post-transcriptional mechanism possibly at the translational level. Evidence is also presented for a less significant post-transcriptional control by heme of mRNA levels for 5-aminolevulinate synthase. These results indicate that the regulation of 5-aminolevulinate synthase in differentiating erythroid cells is complex but differs from that in liver cells where heme controls the level of 5-aminolevulinate synthase by acting primarily to inhibit gene transcription.","['Elferink, C J', 'Sassa, S', 'May, B K']","['Elferink CJ', 'Sassa S', 'May BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Sep 15;263(26):13012-6.,"['Department of Pharmacology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['S0021-9258(18)37664-6 [pii]'],['DK-32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

This suggests that when peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate samples fail to indicate the diagnosis a long-core biopsy may yield positive results.","['Islam, A', 'Henderson, E S']","['Islam A', 'Henderson ES']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Biopsy/*methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1988 Jun;12(6):641-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb01988.x.,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1988.tb01988.x [doi]'],,,,,

In the chronic phase of chronic granulocytic leukaemia, blasts and promyelocytes were seen predominantly in the paratrabecular and perivascular regions, while myelocytes, metamyelocytes and segmented polymorphs were seen predominantly in the central intertrabecular marrow space. The patients were divided into two equal groups according to the degree of perivascular and paratrabecular infiltration: those with minimal (one to three layers of blasts and promyelocytes) and those with marked (four to eight layers of blasts and promyelocytes) infiltration. Ten of the 12 patients in the former group did not develop blast transformation and remained in the chronic phase during a 32- to 84-week follow-up period, whereas nine of the 12 patients in the latter group developed blast transformation, with six undergoing transformation within the first 26 weeks.

The induced synthesis of the 100 kDa protein continued for 6 h, while that of the 40 kDa protein was transient. The 100 kDa protein was detectable in HL-60R cells which were maintained in medium containing 1,000 U/ml TNF, whereas the synthesis of the 40 kDa protein could be transiently induced by TNF at 10(5) U/ml. Dot blot hybridization revealed that the steady-state level of c-myc mRNA in HL-60 cells was transiently reduced by TNF at 100 U/ml but remained at a reduced level for 6 h when 10(5) U/ml TNF was present. In HL-60R cells, TNF at 10(5) U/ml could transiently reduce the c-myc mRNA level.

Sixty-five patients were investigated at initial diagnosis, 30 patients in control phase, and 41 patients in blast phase. In untreated chronic phase, the relative concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in BM were not significantly different from those of normal controls, but there was generally a marked increase in circulating CFU-GM. The 6 Ph1-negative patients did not show different growth characteristics. We were unable to correlate the CFU-GM number to any of the hematologic parameters as well as to the response to busulfan therapy. Pretreated patients with excessive cluster formation did not necessarily indicate impending blast crisis. In hematologic remission, the numbers of CFU-GM in both BM and PB were well within the ranges of normal controls. Culture results in blast phase revealed a spectrum of abnormal growth. In myeloid crisis, 14/29 BM and 12/29 PB samples showed increased colony and cluster formations which were composed predominantly of immature cells with variable degeneration. Marrow cells in lymphoid crisis produced low numbers of both colonies and clusters in 5 out of 8 patients, while blood cells from 8 out of 10 patients formed large amount of colonies of normal morphology.

In addition, each displays novel and instructive features. We argue that the surface and globin phenotype of all erythroleukemia lines is nonrandom and that it may be of physiologic relevance; it could represent the most prevalent phenotype of cells transformed by leukemia in vivo, and it raises the possibility that cells with similar potentials exist transiently during normal hematopoietic differentiation before their irreversible commitment to a single lineage.

The activity of glyoxalase I was decreased and the activity of glyoxalase II was markedly increased relative to the level in control HL60 promyelocytes. There was a decrease in the apparent maximum velocity, Vmax, of glyoxalase I, and an increase in the Vmax of glyoxalase II. The apparent Michaelis constants for both enzymes remained unchanged. The flux of intermediates metabolised via the glyoxalase system increased during differentiation, as judged by the formation of D-lactic acid, whereas the percentage of glucotriose metabolised via the glyoxalase system remained unchanged. The cellular concentrations of the glyoxalase substrates, methylglyoxal and S-D-lactoylglutathione, were markedly decreased during differentiation. The maturation of HL60 promyelocytes is associated with an increased ability to metabolise S-D-lactoylglutathione by glyoxalase II and a concomitant decrease in the mean intracellular concentrations of S-D-lactoylglutathione and methylglyoxal. The maintenance of a high concentration of S-D-lactoylglutathione in HL60 promyelocytes may be related to the status of the microtubular cytoskeleton, since S-D-lactoylglutathione potentiates the GTP-promoted assembly of microtubules.","['Hooper, N I', 'Tisdale, M J', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Hooper NI', 'Tisdale MJ', 'Thornalley PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Formamides)', '0 (Lactates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '722KLD7415 (Pyruvaldehyde)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.2.6 (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase)', 'EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'JLC76XF39H (S-lactoylglutathione)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Formamides', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lyases/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyruvaldehyde/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*metabolism']",1988/09/08 00:00,1988/09/08 00:01,['1988/09/08 00:00'],"['1988/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Sep 8;966(3):362-9. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(88)90086-4.,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.']","['0304-4165(88)90086-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(88)90086-4 [doi]']",,,,,

Also, when closely packed in an aggregate, an energy transfer between two adjacent molecules of pyrene occurred, resulting in a shift of the peak of the emission spectrum from 378 nm ('monomeric') to 475 nm ('excimeric'). These two respective properties were utilized for the following: (a) A spectrofluorometric measurement of the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of the pyrene fatty acid, defined as the concentration at which the 475 nm emission peak appeared as a consequence of the aggregation of P12 molecules in aqueous solution to form micelles; the CMC of P12 was found to be in the range of 1 to 2 microM. (b) The penetration of P12, from an aqueous solution or dispersion, into unilamellar phospholipid vesicles was determined by monitoring the increase of the fluorescence at 378 nm. The fluorescence increase was time-dependent and proportional to the respective concentrations of P12 or phospholipid vesicles. Substituting the neutral phosphatidylcholine with the negatively-charged phosphatidylserine vesicles resulted in a slower rate as well as lesser total uptake of P12. (c) The uptake of P12 by cells was accompanied by an increase in the monomeric fluorescence emission intensity. Using cells in suspension, this could be followed continuously in a spectrofluorometer equipped with a recorder. The uptake was found to be time-dependent and proportional to P12 concentration.","['Gatt, S', 'Fibach, E']","['Gatt S', 'Fibach E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lauric Acids/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Liposomes/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Sep 1;943(3):447-53. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(88)90376-8.,"['Department of Membrane Biochemistry and Neurochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.']","['0005-2736(88)90376-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(88)90376-8 [doi]']",,,,,

Treatment of cells with TPA for 6 h also increased the mass of CerPCho by 35%. Sphingosine (25 microM) or H7 (100 microM), inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro, inhibited some, but not all effects of TPA on endogenous protein phosphorylation in intact cells, and failed to inhibit TPA-stimulated synthesis of CerPCho. However, bryostatin, mezerein, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, and polymyxin B, previously all shown to stimulate PKC in vivo, also stimulated the synthesis of CerPCho.

Biochemical assay.,260-5,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an integral erythrocyte membrane protein. A role for the enzyme in the developing human erythron is being explored. Assays of AchE by the standard Ellman technique overestimate the amount of enzyme by failing to account for the contribution of hemoglobin to the optical density of the reaction mixture. Furthermore, reliance on substrate selection alone for specificity is unsatisfactory. Incorporation of inhibitors of ""true"" AchE and of pseudocholinesterase confer greater ability to distinguish one enzyme from the other. In our experience, the inhibitor constant (Kl) for edrophonium, which is highly specific for AChE, is approximately 5 x 10(-5) M against adult human erythrocytes that contain significantly more total cholinesterase activity than do erythrocytes from umbilical cord blood. This consists of both ""true"" and ""pseudo"" enzyme, the former predominating and accounting for 0.75-1.65 (mean 1.02, median 0.87) femtomoles of substrate hydrolysed per min per cell in adult blood, with values of 0.15-1.04 (mean 0.71, median 0.73) obtained on cord blood.

AChE was also demonstrated in fresh (ALL) and cultured (K562 and HL60) human leukemic cells, as well as in primitive granulocyte-macrophage and erythroid cells cloned from normal human bone marrow. In the erythroid colonies the enzyme activity was 0-3.76 (mean 1.20, median 0.76) femtomoles per min per cell, apparently the first successful measurement of AChE in such cells.","['Barr, R D', 'Koekebakker, M', 'Lawson, A A']","['Barr RD', 'Koekebakker M', 'Lawson AA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)'],IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells/enzymology', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Time Factors']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Aug;28(4):260-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830280409.,"['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['10.1002/ajh.2830280409 [doi]'],,,,,

More than 280 passages have been performed in 3 years. Cell growth has been rapid and stable. Incidence of tumour formation was 100% with various routes of inoculation. The nature of granulocytic leukemia was confirmed by examination of cytology, cytochemistry, pathology and ultrastructural changes. Analysis proved chromosomes to be hypodiploid with model number of 39, loss of chromosomes, and presence of a marker. Besides the chromosomal change as mentioned above, both L883-A and L833-B derived from colonies formed from the L833 cells cultured in semi-solid agar medium, have their own marker. The cell line was sensitive to various types of antitumour agents in varying degrees. It was also sensitive to ionizing radiation. D0 values of L833 and L883-A cells were 98.8 and 104.9 rad, respectively. The results were similar to that of L801. Establishment of this cell line is of important significance for studying leukemia and screening anti-tumour agents, as well as provides a useful direct, economic and precisely quantitative tool for other relative studies.","['Li, X L', 'Gao, F M', 'Zhao, N K', 'Ge, Z L', 'Liu, X Z', 'Ji, X J', 'Liu, H X']","['Li XL', 'Gao FM', 'Zhao NK', 'Ge ZL', 'Liu XZ', 'Ji XJ', 'Liu HX']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Sci Sin B,"Scientia Sinica.

The t(9;22) translocation was first recognised in CML patients by its 22q- or Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. While all Ph positive CML patients so far described have a chromosome 22 breakpoint within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) located in the 3' part of the phl gene, only some Ph positive ALL patients have breakpoints in bcr. We have cloned the breakpoint of the 9q+ chromosome from the DNA of a Ph positive ALL patient in whom there is no breakpoint in the bcr. The non-chromosome 9 sequences of the breakpoint region are shown to be derived from chromosome 22. The breakpoint in chromosome 22 is shown to be the first intron of the phl gene about 66kb upstream of the bcr. Using probes from this intron, rearrangements were detected in the DNA of two out of twelve additional Ph positive, bcr negative ALL patients.","['van der Feltz, M J', 'Shivji, M K', 'Grosveld, G', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['van der Feltz MJ', 'Shivji MK', 'Grosveld G', 'Wiedemann LM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1988 Aug;3(2):215-9.,"['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",,,,,,

CSF samples were obtained from an Ommaya reservoir previously inserted for treatment of CNS relapse. At the time of the study, the children were all in remission and had been on oral 6-MP (42-63 mg m-2) once daily for at least 24 weeks. Immediately before dose intake on the day of study (about 24 h after last dose), the concentrations of 6-MP in CSF, plasma and red blood cells were rather similar and below 20 ng ml-1 in all patients. After dose intake, the concentrations in plasma and in red blood cells increased to 40-200 ng nl-1 within 0.5-4 h. In contrast, the concentration of 6-MP in the CSF remained fairly constant around 4-10 ng ml-1 throughout the time period studied (up to 4 h). It is concluded that 6-MP can be detected in CSF during oral maintenance therapy and that the drug has different pharmacokinetic profile in CSF to that in plasma and red blood cells.

Five types of deletion were observed according to site and size, but region D through G was the common missing part in all five types of chromosome 2 deletion. The occurrence of chromosome 2 deletion was also tested among bone marrow cells removed from 17 mice, 4 months after exposure to 300 rad whole body irradiation, long before the time when AML development is expected. About 80% of the mice tested had different levels of deleted chromosome 2 among their bone marrow population.

Particular substrates for this reaction are the GTP-binding proteins involved in the adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C second messenger pathways. Consequently, mono-ADP ribosylation may be an important element in intracellular signaling. Cholera toxin is a potent mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase, while benzylaminododecylguanine hydrochloride (BADGH) is an inhibitor of cholera toxin-induced ADP ribosylation. We have used these compounds to modulate the effects of inducers of differentiation in HL-60 cells. Cholera toxin, although unable to induce differentiation itself, synergized with inducers of both granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. In contrast, BADGH selectively inhibited the growth of undifferentiated cells.

However, because of the complexity of phospholipid remodeling processes, it is essential to distinguish PLD clearly from other phospholipases and phospholipid remodeling enzymes. Therefore, to establish unequivocally PLD activity in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 granulocytes, to demonstrate the relative contribution of PLD to phospholipid turnover, and to validate the hypothesis that the formation of phosphatidylethanol is an expression of PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation, we have developed methodologies to label HL-60 granulocytes in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-PC) with 32P without labeling cellular ATP. These methodologies involve (a) synthesis of alkyl-lysoPC containing 32P by a combination of enzymatic and chemical procedures and (b) incubation of HL-60 granulocytes with this alkyl-[32P] lysoPC which enters the cell and becomes acylated into membrane-associated alkyl-[32P]PC. Upon stimulation of these 32P-labeled cells with the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), alkyl-[32P]phosphatidic acid (alkyl-[32P]PA) is formed rapidly. Because, under these conditions, cellular ATP has not been labeled with 32P, alkyl-[32P]PA must be formed via PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of alkyl-[32P]PC at the terminal phosphodiester bond. This result conclusively demonstrates fMLP-induced activation of PLD in HL-60 granulocytes. These 32P-labeled HL-60 granulocytes have also been stimulated in the presence of ethanol to produce alkyl-[32P]phosphatidylethanol (alkyl-[32P]PEt). Formation of alkyl-[32P]PEt parallels that of alkyl-[32P]PA with respect to time course, fMLP concentration, inhibition by a specific fMLP antagonist (t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe), and Ca2+ concentration. These results strongly support the hypothesis that in HL-60 granulocytes, PEt is formed via PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation. Moreover, using HL-60 granulocytes double-labeled by incubation with [3H]alkyl-lysoPC and alkyl-[32P]lysoPC, it has been established that the early (30 s) appearance of alkyl-PA is due primarily to PLD, not phospholipase C as previously thought, and that alkyl-PEt is formed exclusively by PLD. These results constitute the first direct evidence for receptor-linked activation of PLD, leading to the generation of PA and PEt in an intact cell system.","['Pai, J K', 'Siegel, M I', 'Egan, R W', 'Billah, M M']","['Pai JK', 'Siegel MI', 'Egan RW', 'Billah MM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Platelet Activating Factor/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1988/09/05 00:00,1988/09/05 00:01,['1988/09/05 00:00'],"['1988/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Sep 5;263(25):12472-7.,"['Department of Allergy and Inflammation, Schering-Plough Corporation, Bloomfield, New Jersey 07003.']",['S0021-9258(18)37778-0 [pii]'],,,,,

Scatchard analysis of the binding curve of the 125I-labeled S component to HL-60 cells showed two classes of binding sites. The binding sites with higher affinity had a dissociation constant of 3.39 nM, and the number of binding sites per cell was 730. The specific binding of the 125I-labeled S component to DMSO-treated cells increased depending on the period of DMSO treatment. Scatchard analysis of the binding curve of cells treated with DMSO for 7 days gave a straight line. The dissociation constant was 1.78 nM, and the number of binding sites per cell was 6,920. The total binding of the 125I-labeled F component to DMSO-treated cells increased about twofold over binding to HL-60 cells. However, in the presence of the unlabeled S component, the increase of binding of the F component to DMSO-treated cells was much greater.

The ALL cases were immunologically classified as T (10), common (20), B (3) and null (4). In each subgroup the majority of lymphoblasts were positive, with heterogeneous positivity patterns and variable degrees of enzyme activity. Most T lymphoblasts were characterized by focal localization of FH4D, whereas in common blasts reactivity - usually less strong - was either focally localized or scattered with several fine granules. Finally, many B and null blasts showed diffuse positivity. A quantitative evaluation of FH4D activity using cytophotometric technique (Vickers M86) demonstrated higher degrees of reactivity in leukemic blasts than in normal lymphocytes. Moreover, slightly different levels of reactivity were observed in relation to immunological phenotype, age and stage of the disease.

The effect of this treatment on DNA damage was studied in the leukemia cells of four patients using the alkaline elution technique modified to measure DNA in unlabeled human cells. A fluorescence assay using Hoechst 33258 dye was applied for the determination of eluted DNA. After a single infusion of mitoxantrone, neither frank nor protein-associated single-strand breaks (SSB) were observed. Even repeated treatment with mitoxantrone on 3 consecutive days did not induce significant SSB. However, after the combined sequential infusion of ara-C and mitoxantrone the DNA elution pattern changed, showing significant DNA damage. SSB remained apparent after 24 h and increased with subsequent doses of ara-C and mitoxantrone. Studies of other patients treated with ara-C alone did not reveal significant SSB (n = 5).

A possible mechanism of cyclosporin A and verapamil reversal of pleiotropic drug resistance in neoplasia.,163-8,"We have recently shown that cyclosporin A (CsA) reverses pleiotropic drug resistance in human acute lymphatic leukemia in vitro and daunorubicin resistance in Ehrlich ascites tumor in vivo. In the present study we examined the mechanisms by which CsA might reverse pleiotropic drug resistance relative to changes in cellular plasma membrane potentials and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Membrane potentials were measured with DIOC5 dye flow-cytometrically and [Ca2+]i levels with Quin 2 dye spectrofluorimetrically. All pleiotropic (PDR) drug-resistant tumor sublines had decreased membrane potentials (membrane depolarized) compared with their corresponding drug-sensitive parental tumors. In comparison, the membrane potentials of a control antimetabolite-resistant acute leukemia cell line were unchanged. The basal levels of [Ca2+]i in the PDR sublines were variable compared with those of parental drug-sensitive cell lines. Incubation of all PDR tumor sublines with CsA or verapamil resulted in the restoration of membrane potentials to that characteristic of the corresponding drug-sensitive parental tumor. Cyclosporin A produced variable changes in the levels of [Ca2+]i. These data suggest that alteration of membrane potentials is one of the mechanisms responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance in malignancy and show that this alteration is corrected by CsA and verapamil.","['Vayuvegula, B', 'Slater, L', 'Meador, J', 'Gupta, S']","['Vayuvegula B', 'Slater L', 'Meador J', 'Gupta S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;22(2):163-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00257315.,"['Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['10.1007/BF00257315 [doi]'],['AI-26465/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and stomatitis, were the major forms of dose-limiting toxicity, affecting the majority of patients at all levels of idarubicin dosage. Two patients who had received total-body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation developed life-threatening gastrointestinal toxicity suggestive of a radiation ""recall"" phenomenon. Echocardiographic evidence of depressed cardiac function, without clinical symptoms or signs, was noted in six of 11 patients, although the changes were judged to be significant in only one child. The maximal tolerated oral dose of idarubicin was 40 mg/m2 per day. The medium terminal plasma half-life of idarubicin was 9.2 h (range, 6.4-25.5 h). Both idarubicin and its metabolite, idarubicinol, accumulated during the 3 days of therapy. Among the five patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia whose cells were tested for drug sensitivity in vitro, the idarubicin concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) of cluster and colony formation ranged from 1.6 x 10(-10) M to 5 x 10(-7) M. There was no obvious relationship between the IC50 for idarubicin and that for epirubicin or daunorubicin. Oral idarubicin produced definite antileukemic effects, clearing blast cells from the circulation in 13 of the 14 evaluable patients. Future studies should define an optimal dose schedule to circumvent the limiting gastrointestinal complications associated with this agent.","['Pui, C H', 'de Graaf, S S', 'Dow, L W', 'Rodman, J H', 'Evans, W E', 'Alpert, B S', 'Murphy, S B']","['Pui CH', 'de Graaf SS', 'Dow LW', 'Rodman JH', 'Evans WE', 'Alpert BS', 'Murphy SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Sep 15;48(18):5348-52.,"[""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K 562 cells were found to be sensitive to tiazofurin with an IC50 of 19.2 microM. TAD content in K 562 cells (1.3 nmol/10(9)/h) was in the range found in susceptible murine and human tumor cells. Studies were conducted to relate tiazofurin toxicity with biochemical effects by examining nucleotide pools. Among the nucleotides, only guanylate pools were significantly depleted by the drug. To further study the effect of the drug on the purine nucleotide de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, flux of radiolabelled formate and guanine was employed. The results showed that de novo synthesis of guanylates was curtailed primarily by the drug's action without influencing adenylate biosynthesis or salvage of guanine to guanylates. These studies show that K 562 cells are sensitive to selective inhibition of de novo guanylate pathway indicating that human chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis might be a good candidate for Phase II clinical trials with tiazofurin.","['Pillwein, K', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Weber, G']","['Pillwein K', 'Jayaram HN', 'Weber G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Formates)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Formates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Aug;57(2):97-100. doi: 10.1007/BF00319733.,"['Pediatric Clinic, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['10.1007/BF00319733 [doi]'],['R 35 CA42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Forty-two had previously untreated AML and 30 had AML after a preleukaemic phase, refractory AML or relapsed AML. The previously untreated patients received a 7-day course of cytosine arabinoside (100 or 200 mg/m2 daily), daunorubicin and vincristine while the remaining patients received a 7-day course of cytosine-arabinoside (1 g/m2 q 12h for 6 days) and amsacrine (on day 7). The percentage of malignant cells and the reduction in the percentage of malignant cells were determined by means of bone marrow aspirates taken on day 6 of the chemotherapy course and at the time of diagnosis. Both variables correlated significantly with the ultimate treatment outcome; the reduction in the percentage of malignant cells correlated even more significantly than the absolute percentage malignant cells in the day-6 bone marrow. By means of multiple regression analysis it became possible to calculate the probability of achieving complete remission for the individual patient; this is given by the equation: probability = 1.9-0.009X (% malignant cell reduction). In addition, the mean percentage of malignant cells in the day-6 bone marrow was significantly higher for patients who failed to achieve than those who entered complete remission. Eighty-six per cent of the patients with less than 20% malignant cells on day 6 entered remission, while 75% of the patients with more than 21% malignant cells failed to achieve complete remission (p less than 0.001). Although all of these calculations support the predictive value of the day-6 bone marrow aspirate, the 95% confidence intervals are too large to allow reliable and safe predictions; therefore more patients must be studied to demonstrate the reliability of this test.","['Peters, W G', 'Willemze, R', 'Zwaan, F E', 'Colly, L P']","['Peters WG', 'Willemze R', 'Zwaan FE', 'Colly LP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Time Factors']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Aug;57(2):91-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00319732.,"['Department of Haematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, The Netherlands.']",['10.1007/BF00319732 [doi]'],,,,,

In all patients with myelocytic leukaemias there were elevated levels of elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (E-alpha 1PI), while in the lymphatic leukaemias complexed elastase levels were decreased. The highest values were found in the peripheral blood plasma and bone marrow plasma of patients with CML. Despite high E-alpha 1PI concentrations there were no signs of bleeding or consumption of plasmatic coagulation factors. In AML a wide range of E-alpha 1PI levels was observed, extending from slightly elevated to four hundred-fold increased. In myeloblastic leukaemias without maturation (FAB M 1) the concentrations of complexed elastase remained below 150 ng/ml. In myeloblastic leukaemias with maturation (FAB M2) the E-alpha 1PI values ranged between 214 ng/ml and 850 ng/ml (means = 402 +/- 69), and in myelo-monoblastic leukaemias (FAB M4) between 450 ng/ml and 720 ng/ml (means = 663 +/- 72). The only case of promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M 3) exhibited an extremely high value of 4,550 ng/ml, while a monocytic leukaemia (FAB M5) showed an extremely low value of 5 ng/ml. During cytostatic therapy there was a rapid decrease in levels of complexed elastase, with E-alpha 1PI values returning to normal in remission. In recidivating cases there was an increase of E-alpha 1PI levels in AML and a decrease in ALL. There was a correlation between the E-alpha 1PI concentrations in peripheral plasma and leukaemic bone marrow infiltration, so providing a good basis for monitoring remission from leukaemia and indicating relapse. It was also interesting to observe an extremely low E-alpha 1PI level (5 ng/ml) in patients with myelodysplasia. Under Decortin/Plenastril therapy the concentration rose to 50 ng/ml. An E-alpha 1PI level of 10 ng per ml was observed in one case of Ranitidine agranulocytosis. Under corticoid therapy the value returned to normal within eight days.","['Hastka, J']",['Hastka J'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,['EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)'],IM,"['*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Leukopenia/diagnosis', 'Neural Tube Defects/diagnosis', 'Pancreatic Elastase/blood']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Aug;57(2):69-75. doi: 10.1007/BF00319729.,"['III.

Specific binding of human heart ferritin could be demonstrated at 37 degrees C, whereas no binding of liver ferritin could be found. The uptake of labelled heart ferritin was abolished by incubation at 4 degrees C, by prior treatment of the HL60 cells with pronase and by the addition of human plasma to the medium. On the other hand, the addition of excess unlabelled human liver or rat liver ferritin had no effect on the uptake of labelled human heart ferritin. Dissociation studies showed that about 55% of the bound heart ferritin radioactivity could be released by incubation with medium alone and at least 90% with excess unlabelled heart ferritin. Over 70% of the dissociated ferritin could be precipitated with polyclonal anti-ferritin serum or trichloroacetic acid. More than two-thirds of the radioactivity which could not be released after washing in medium alone was recovered in the soluble intracellular fraction following cell lysis. Almost all of the soluble radioactivity could be precipitated with the polyclonal antiserum, indicating that very little lysosomal degradation of internalized heart ferritin had occurred. The present studies demonstrate a protein-mediated binding mechanism for acidic isoferritins on HL60 cells. These observations agree with published evidence that ferritin is often associated with cell membranes and are consistent with a possible role for the protein in the regulation of haematopoiesis or in iron transfer.","['Covell, A M', 'Cook, J D']","['Covell AM', 'Cook JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Pronase/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Aug;69(4):559-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02415.x.,"['Department of Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66103.']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02415.x [doi]'],['DK39246/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

In the 54 marrow lymphoma cases studied a highly significant correlation was observed between the proportion of Ki-67 (+) cells and the separation into low- and high-grade malignant lymphomas according to the Kiel classification. In patients with multiple myeloma at the first diagnosis, the percentage of Ki-67 (+) cells was low (6-10%). In contrast, a high percentage of Ki-67 (+) cells (40-50%) was observed in a young adult with multiple myeloma, in a patient who first presented at the clinical observation with an extradural mass and in three patients who developed extramedullary masses several years after the initial diagnosis of myeloma. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemias of common type the mean value of Ki-67 labelling was 31.3%. Because of their simplicity and rapidity, immunocytochemical techniques may be expected to replace autoradiography and flow cytometry for the detection of proliferating cells in haematological samples.","['Falini, B', 'Canino, S', 'Sacchi, S', 'Ciani, C', 'Martelli, M F', 'Gerdes, J', 'Stein, H', 'Pileri, S', 'Gobbi, M', 'Fagioli, M']","['Falini B', 'Canino S', 'Sacchi S', 'Ciani C', 'Martelli MF', 'Gerdes J', 'Stein H', 'Pileri S', 'Gobbi M', 'Fagioli M', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jul;69(3):311-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02368.x.,"['Department of Clinical Medicine, Perugia University, Italy.']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02368.x [doi]'],,,,,

Variant cell lines, derived from HL60, which show reduced capacities for neutrophil and monocyte differentiation can be arranged in a developmental sequence which suggests that the potentials for neutrophil and monocyte differentiation are expressed sequentially by HL60 cells in this order. Analysis of the patterns of total cellular phosphoproteins within HL60 and 5 variant cell lines, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, has identified 6 distinct phosphoproteins which show progressive differences in the intensity of spots between the variant lines. The changes in these phosphoproteins relate to the position of the lines within the proposed development sequence. Similarly, lines placed close together in the sequence are more similar, as regards phosphoprotein profiles, than lines placed far apart. These studies provide direct evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the potentials for neutrophil and monocyte differentiation are expressed sequentially during myelopoiesis. Furthermore, two phosphoprotein spots were found to be restricted to lines able to differentiate towards monocytes. These proteins may play important roles during commitment to monocyte differentiation.","['Bunce, C M', 'Lord, J M', 'Wong, A K', 'Brown, G']","['Bunce CM', 'Lord JM', 'Wong AK', 'Brown G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1988 Jun;57(6):559-63. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1988.128.,"['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['10.1038/bjc.1988.128 [doi]'],,PMC2246464,,,

Thereafter, at these settings, there was satisfactory linear agreement between the fluorescence intensity profiles, as measured by the flow cytometer and the microphotometer, of stained cell populations.

The first published study involved 82 cases of STS (ICD 171) and found a relative risk of 2.8 (90% confidence interval 1.3-6.3). Interviews with an additional 51 cases reported here revealed a relative risk of 1.6 (90% confidence interval 0.9-3.0). Two further studies involved interviews with 100 cases of the category of NHL involving lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma (ICD 200) and 83 cases of other NHL (ICD 202). Relative risk estimates were 1.8 (90% confidence interval 1.1-2.9) and 1.7 (90% confidence interval 1.0-2.8), respectively. A study of 150 cases of AML (ICD 205.0) found a relative risk of 2.5 for abattoir workers (90% confidence interval 1.3-4.7). Finally, a United States cohort study found a standardized mortality ratio of 2.4 (90% confidence interval 0.8-5.4) for Hodgkin's disease (ICD 201) and 2.2 (90% confidence interval 0.8-4.5) for cancer of other lymphatic tissue (ICD 202, 203, 208) among abattoir workers.

The bone marrow of patients with CML may be exquisitely sensitive to busulfan, and occasionally such patients develop pancytopenia, secondary to hypoplasia or aplasia of the bone marrow, which is presumed to be due to busulfan-induced marrow toxicity. We report a case of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML who developed pancytopenia while being treated with busulfan; however, the patient's bone marrow was not hypoplastic or aplastic but rather hyperplastic with sideroblastic changes. Busulfan is not known to cause sideroblastic changes, so this was considered to herald a transformation into acute leukemia. Busulfan was stopped, and only supportive treatment was given. To our surprise approximately 22 weeks after busulfan was stopped, the sideroblastic changes had disappeared and the bone marrow again showed features of CML.

Incubation of the cells with a combined regimen of retinoic acid and dimethyl formamide resulted in granulocytic morphological differentiation and acquisition of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, a measure of superoxide generation. During the 5-day course of induced differentiation, the levels of X-CGD mRNA transcripts rose 13-fold, with a 2-fold increase detectable within 3 h of exposure to retinoic acid. Relative transcription rates for the X-CGD gene, determined by nuclear runoff, increased two- to eightfold after 24 to 72 h of induced differentiation. However, the greater change in X-CGD mRNA levels than that in transcription rates implies the involvement of posttranscriptional regulation as well. Fractionation by centrifugal elutriation into phases of the cell cycle showed expression of X-CGD transcripts predominantly in G1 cells before induction and in all phases of the cell cycle 24 h after induction. Thus the rapid increase in X-CGD expression in induced cells reflects the acquisition of functional competence and not the concomitant cessation of proliferation or shift in cell cycle distribution.","['Barker, K A', 'Orkin, S H', 'Newburger, P E']","['Barker KA', 'Orkin SH', 'Newburger PE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cytochrome b Group/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Jul;8(7):2804-10. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.7.2804-2810.1988.,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['10.1128/mcb.8.7.2804-2810.1988 [doi]'],['CA-38325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC363499,,,

To determine the mechanism of action of epo, the effect of drugs on the in vitro colony formation of CFU-E cells induced from a novel murine erythroleukemia cell line, TSA8, was examined. While cytosine arabinoside inhibited colony formation and terminal differentiation of the CFU-E cells responding to epo, herbimycin, which is a drug that inhibits src-related phosphorylation, inhibited colony formation only. The same effect of herbimycin was observed with normal CFU-E cells from mouse fetal liver cells.

In contrast, during complete remission in AML and during the chronic phase of CML cells containing c-myc protein are rare. Several studies demonstrated a discordance in the amount of c-myc transcript and the amount of c-myc protein present in cell populations thereby suggesting the presence of translational or post-translational regulation of c-myc expression.

The importance of controlling for social class differences when searching for treatment effects on IQ and achievement is stressed.","['Trautman, P D', 'Erickson, C', 'Shaffer, D', ""O'Connor, P A"", 'Sitarz, A', 'Correra, A', 'Schonfeld, I S']","['Trautman PD', 'Erickson C', 'Shaffer D', ""O'Connor PA"", 'Sitarz A', 'Correra A', 'Schonfeld IS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Dev Behav Pediatr,Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,8006933,,IM,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*psychology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sleep Stages/radiation effects', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors', 'Wechsler Scales']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Dev Behav Pediatr. 1988 Jun;9(3):122-8.,"['Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.']",,"['5T01 MH 07715-19/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 16434-01/PHS HHS/United States', 'MH 30906-0-5/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

While 125I or 59Fe labels were externalized after initial binding and internalization, a large proportion of 3H label was internalized and remained within the cell. When the supernatant of these experiments was studied by isoelectricfocusing and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120) affinity chromatography, generation of asialotransferrin was noted by both techniques. Incubation of liver endothelium with double-labeled TF (sialic acids with 3H and protein core with 125I or 59Fe) led initially to a concordant uptake of the two labels, which were then dissociated and 3H was retained by the cell. These findings indicate desialation of TF by liver endothelium.

[3H]VCR bound to the plasma membrane prepared from K562/ADM cells, but not from parental K562 cells, depending on the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+. Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate was not effective in the binding of [3H]VCR, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for this binding. Dissociation constant (Kd) of VCR binding was 0.24 +/- 0.04 microM in the presence of 3 mM ATP. In the absence of ATP, specific binding of VCR to K562/ADM membrane was also observed; however, the affinity (Kd = 9.7 +/- 3.1 microM) was 40 times lower than that observed in the presence of ATP. The high affinity VCR binding to K562/ADM membrane was dependent on temperature. The bound [3H]VCR molecules were rapidly released by unlabeled VCR added to the reaction mixture at 25 degrees C. The high affinity binding of [3H]VCR to K562/ADM membrane was inhibited by VCR, vinblastine, actinomycin D, and ADM, to which K562/ADM cells exhibit cross-resistance, whereas 5-fluorouracil and camptothecin, to which K562/ADM cells are equally sensitive as K562 cells, did not inhibit the [3H]VCR binding. Furthermore, verapamil and other agents, which are known to circumvent drug resistance by inhibiting the active efflux of antitumor agents from resistant cells, could also inhibit the high affinity [3H]VCR binding. These results indicate that ATP/Mg2+-dependent high affinity VCR binding to the membrane of resistant cells closely correlates with the active drug efflux of this resistant cell line.","['Naito, M', 'Hamada, H', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Naito M', 'Hamada H', 'Tsuruo T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1988/08/25 00:00,1988/08/25 00:01,['1988/08/25 00:00'],"['1988/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Aug 25;263(24):11887-91.,"['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['S0021-9258(18)37869-4 [pii]'],,,,,

Prompted by the initial finding that expression of TfRs by K562 cells correlates with target sensitivity to NK cytotoxicity, we have investigated the role of two proposed NK-target structures, the TfR and 4F2 molecule in three other tumour cell lines which vary in their susceptibility to NK activity. We report that similar to K562 cells, MOLT 4, Raji and HL60 cells demonstrate phorbol-ester-induced down-regulation of TfR expression. The expression of TfRs alone does not determine target sensitivity. However, TfRs are probably located close to the NK-target structure in NK-sensitive cell lines. Based on the properties of phorbol ester induction, it is possible that the NK-target molecule is down-regulated in response to phorbol ester induction in a similar, if not identical manner to that of the TfR; thus, rendering NK-sensitive cells resistant to NK killing, after TPA exposure. Conversely, the target molecule is probably upregulated in MOLT 4 cells after TPA treatment as indicated by the acquired sensitivity of these cells to NK-mediated cytolysis. The expression of 4F2 molecules was not influenced by TPA treatment and does not correlate with NK sensitivity.","['Zanyk, M J', 'Banerjee, D', 'McFarlane, D L']","['Zanyk MJ', 'Banerjee D', 'McFarlane DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein-1)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein-1', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1988 Aug;9(8):1377-81. doi: 10.1093/carcin/9.8.1377.,"['Department of Pathology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['10.1093/carcin/9.8.1377 [doi]'],,,,,

PLC also induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells as manifested by adherence, growth inhibition, and appearance of monocytic cell surface antigens. Furthermore, PLC treatment decreased c-myc mRNA levels and induced c-fos, c-fms, and tumor necrosis factor transcripts. The changes in gene expression induced by PLC are similar to those previously shown to be associated with phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Our results thus demonstrate that exogenous PLC activates HL-60 cell protein kinase C and that this effect is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation. PLC may therefore play a role in transducing signals from physiological inducers of monocytic differentiation.","['Stone, R M', 'Weber, B L', 'Spriggs, D R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Stone RM', 'Weber BL', 'Spriggs DR', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*pharmacology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):739-44.,"['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, MA 02115.']",['S0006-4971(20)81059-3 [pii]'],['CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Sixty-five patients in chronic phase (CP), 28 of whom were untreated and 37 pretreated, and nine patients in accelerated phase (AP), were started on IFN three times a week. Patients in CP were randomized to receive 2 or 5 X 10(6) IU/m2, while patients in AP were all given the dose of 5 X 10(6) IU/m2, in addition to concomitant chemotherapy. Patients in CP who were unresponsive to the lower dose were crossed to the higher dose. Of 63 evaluable patients in CP, 43 (68%) responded, 29 (46%) achieved complete hematologic response (CHR), and 14 (22%) achieved partial hematologic response (PHR). The response rate appeared to be significantly influenced by the IFN dose in pretreated patients. Of the nine patients in AP, two attained PHR and one CHR. More recently, eight previously untreated CP cases were submitted to daily IFN administration at doses from 2 to 5 X 10(6) IU/m2. This daily schedule was also applied to patients who had obtained, with the intermittent treatment, a PHR persisting unmodified for six months (nine patients) or an unstable CHR (five patients). Seven of the eight previously untreated patients, and five of the nine PHR patients crossed to daily IFN reached CHR. In the total series of previously untreated patients, the response rate proved to be significantly influenced by the initial risk status. Cytogenetic improvement was seen in 37 of 53 responders (70%) treated for more than 3 months, the median of Ph'-positive cells declining from 100% to 65% (range 0% to 95%). Complete suppression of Ph' chromosome was observed in one case. The cytogenetic response was persistent for over 6 months in 21 patients, but the lowest value of Ph' positivity was usually unstable. At a median follow-up of 56 weeks, 23 of 36 (64%) CHR patients remain in continued disease control with IFN. A blastic transformation (BT) occurred in seven of 21 unresponsive patients and in one of the 36 CHR patients.

The other three differences resulted in changes in the deduced amino acid sequence of GPIIIa; reexamination of the endothelial cell cDNA sequence in these three areas revealed that it is actually identical to the HEL cell sequence. The virtual identity of the endothelial and HEL cell cDNA sequences provides direct evidence that GPIIIa is a subunit common to cell-adhesion receptors present in more than one cell type.

The prevalence of this type of leukemia in the entire series was 11.6%, with a higher incidence among patients with acute transformation of a previous myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (24%) than among the transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (13%) patients. The incidence in the ""de novo"" ANLL was 8% and 16% among secondary leukemias. The presence of bone marrow fibrosis together with low WBC and normal or increased platelet counts despite a severe anemia are the most relevant features in these patients who otherwise displayed an apparently poor prognosis. Megakaryoblasts were morphologically recognized more frequently in the acute transformations of MPD than in de novo ANLL. Only two cases were considered pure AMKL, and in the remaining 26 patients, megakaryoblasts coexisted with other granulomonocytic and/or erythroid populations. Antiglycoprotein IIIa (anti-GPIIIa) (C17) and anti-GPIIb/IIIa (CDw41-, J15-) antibodies are probably the best markers for AMKL, although the monoclonal antibody against GPIX (FMC25) was also positive in a majority of cases but in a lower percentage of cells. On the other hand, megakaryoblasts were generally negative for granulocytic or monocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD15); the expression of HLA-DR antigens in these cells was variable. Our present results indicate that megakaryoblastic involvement is more common than previously recognized. This is true not only in acute transformed leukemias but also in de novo ANLL. Although the diagnosis of these cases should be based on megakaryocytic markers, it is often possible to suspect a diagnosis according to certain clinical and hematologic features.","['San Miguel, J F', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Canizo, M C', 'Ojeda, E', 'Orfao, A', 'Caballero, M D', 'Moro, M J', 'Fisac, P', 'Lopez Borrasca, A']","['San Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez M', 'Canizo MC', 'Ojeda E', 'Orfao A', 'Caballero MD', 'Moro MJ', 'Fisac P', 'Lopez Borrasca A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/immunology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):402-7.,"['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['S0006-4971(20)81007-6 [pii]'],,,,,

The activity of the enzyme in leukemic cells was 2-fold higher than that in normal granulocytes and in morphologically matured myeloid cells. Two latter types of cells did not differ in alpha-mannosidase activity. Kinetic properties, thermo- and pH stability of alpha-mannosidase from normal and leukemic cells were similar. alpha-mannosidase in leukemic and normal cells existed in two forms (A and B), which were easily separated on DEAE-cellulose column. These two forms differed in molecular mass (300 and 290 kD, respectively) and in the degree of sialylation. The quantitative ratios of A and B forms in normal and leukemic cells were different. In normal granulocytes and in mature cells from patients this ratio was 0.60 and 0.67, respectively. In leukemic cells the ratio was found to be 1.31. Thus, in leukemic cells form A of alpha-mannosidase predominanted, whereas in normal cells the predominance of form B was observed. It was suggested therefore that in leukemic cells the enhanced synthesis of alpha-mannosidase occurred in parallel with the accumulation of the B form. This accumulation was assumed as the cause of enhanced activity of the enzyme in immature leukemic cells.","['Preobrazhenskaia, M E', 'Vlasova, A L', 'Ushakova, N A']","['Preobrazhenskaia ME', 'Vlasova AL', 'Ushakova NA']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Kislaia al'fa-D-mannozidaza leikotsitov cheloveka v norme i pri khronicheskom mieloleikoze.,Russia (Federation),Biull Eksp Biol Med,Biulleten' eksperimental'noi biologii i meditsiny,0370627,"['EC 3.2.1.- (Mannosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.24 (alpha-Mannosidase)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Mannosidases/*blood', 'Reference Values', 'alpha-Mannosidase']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biull Eksp Biol Med. 1988 Jul;106(7):92-4.,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 30-month period, 10 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and primary IA developing during initial antileukemia induction therapy and severe granulocytopenia (less than 100/mm3) underwent 14 subsequent courses of intensive marrow aplasia-producing chemotherapy during early complete remission or at leukemia relapse. All patients had evidence of ongoing IA healing by lung computerized tomography (CT) prior to reinstitution of intensive chemotherapy. Nine patients receiving 13 chemotherapy courses also received aggressive prophylactic anti-IA therapy with amphotericin B (1.0 mg/kg/day) and 5-fluorocytosine beginning at least 48 hours prior to antileukemia therapy institution and continued until the time of granulocyte recovery. RESULTS: All nine patients receiving aggressive antifungal therapy survived without clinical evidence of IA reactivation. Transient radiographic evidence of IA reactivation during granulocytopenia was detected by lung CT during two of the 13 chemotherapy courses. In contrast, the patient who did not receive anti-IA prophylaxis had both clinical and radiographic evidence of IA reactivation during severe granulocytopenia and died. Anti-IA prophylaxis was achieved without irreversible nephrotoxicity, prolonged marrow suppression, alteration of antileukemia treatment, or negative impact on clinical outcome relative to acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: This approach of antifungal prophylaxis in adults with acute leukemia and documented primary IA occurring during initial induction chemotherapy has been successful in preventing clinically significant IA reactivation during subsequent granulocytopenic courses, and allows for administration of additional intensive antileukemia therapy.","['Karp, J E', 'Burch, P A', 'Merz, W G']","['Karp JE', 'Burch PA', 'Merz WG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*prevention & control', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Flucytosine/*administration & dosage', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Aug;85(2):203-6. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80343-7.,"['Adult Leukemia Program, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']","['S0002-9343(88)80343-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80343-7 [doi]']",['CA-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

One month later an unsteady gait and mild intention tremor in the hands were noted. By the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with isotonic saline started 1 hour after overdose through a lumbar needle, about 27% of the administered dose was recovered.

A transient phase of increased [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation was noted at 20-24 hr of exposure to TNF. This increase was disproportionate to the much slighter stimulation of the percentage of S-phase cells, which was measured by flow cytometry. Evidence for increased metabolic trapping of [3H]TdR following TNF treatment was apparent from whole cell uptake experiments. The salvage pathway enzyme TdR kinase was therefore measured and was found to be elevated comparably to [3H]TdR uptake. The mechanism of TNF regulation of TdR kinase was further investigated by a series of combination treatment experiments using other biologic factors and pharmacologic inhibitors of various intracellular steps. The response to TNF was not potentiated or reproduced by IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, G-CSF, M-CSF, GM-CSF or alpha- or gamma-interferon. Blockers of early signal transduction steps, including H7, W7, sphingosine, and pertussis toxin, failed to inhibit TNF stimulation of [3H]TdR incorporation. mRNA synthesis inhibition with alpha-amanitin blocked this TNF effect, as did cAMP but not cGMP analogues. A sensitizing effect was noted with amiloride or cytochalasin B, characterized by greater relative increases of [3H]TdR incorporation and TdR kinase activity in response to TNF. In the presence of cytochalasin B, TNF treatment resulted in no change or slight decreases in the percentage of S-phase cells.

Sensitivity was assessed in terms of the percentage cell growth in control cultures, which was determined by exposing exponentially growing cells for 48 h to the following antitumor drugs: 1-(4-amino-2-methylpyridine-5-yl)-methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU), adriamycin (ADM), bleomycin (BLM), cisplatin (DDP), etoposide (VP-16), 5-fluorouracil (5FU), mitomycin C (MMC), methotrexate (MTX), and vinblastine (VLB). As expected, 10-fold or greater differences in sensitivity were scarcely ever observed between the two kinds of cell lines. Thus, we recorded a result of more (or less) sensitivity when there was a difference of 3-fold or more; and compared the drug sensitivity in every pair of carcinoma and leukemia cell lines (20 pairs for each drug). We found that carcinoma cell lines were less sensitive to VP-16, ADM, DDP, and MTX than leukemia cell lines in 18, 15, 12, and 10 of 20 pairs, respectively; only one opposite case was observed, with DDP. On the other hand, no such tendency between the two groups was observed with BLM, 5FU, or MMC. Overall, significantly different sensitivities were observed between them in 91 out of 180 pairs (i.e., 9 antitumor drugs x 5 carcinomas x 4 leukemias), and carcinoma cell lines were less sensitive than leukemia cell lines in 79 of these 91 pairs. These results suggest that the refractoriness of colon carcinoma, etc. to chemotherapy is, at least in part, due to low drug sensitivity of the tumor cell itself.","['Ozawa, S', 'Yasuda, T', 'Inaba, M']","['Ozawa S', 'Yasuda T', 'Inaba M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;22(1):41-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00254179.,"['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['10.1007/BF00254179 [doi]'],,,,,

Sequence analysis has revealed that: (a) the PDGF-2 chain is encoded by the c-sis protooncogene, the cellular counterpart of the simian sarcoma viral oncogene; (b) the PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 chains are related; and (c) the PDGF-1 gene has no known viral homologue. We have previously shown that the PDGF-2 gene is expressed during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced monocytic differentiation of human HL-60 leukemia cells. In the present study, PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 gene expression was compared in HL-60 cells, human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells, and human monocytes. Uninduced HL-60 cells, uninduced THP-1 cells, and resting monocytes had no detectable PDGF-1 or PDGF-2 mRNA. In contrast, both PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 transcripts were detected in HL-60 cells and monocytes induced with TPA, while only PDGF-1 mRNA was found in TPA-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, neither of these transcripts were found during drug induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis: (a) failed to increase PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 mRNA levels in uninduced HL-60 cells; (b) increased PDGF-2, but not PDGF-1, mRNA in resting monocytes; and (c) increased levels of PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 mRNA in HL-60 cells and monocytes treated with TPA. This effect of cycloheximide was related in part to stabilization of both transcripts. Thus, PDGF-1 and PDGF-2 genes are differentially regulated in myeloid cells, although they share common control mechanisms at the post-transcriptional level. Differential regulation of PDGF gene expression would result in altered chain composition of the PDGF protein and possibly changes in biological activity.","['Sariban, E', 'Kufe, D']","['Sariban E', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Aug 15;48(16):4498-502.,"['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Other predictive factors for higher response rates were a younger age group, a good performance status, and a favorable or diploid karyotype.

The RIP from barley has been purified to homogeneity by modifications of the methods of Roberts and Selitrennikoff and crosslinked to the binding subunit B of the seed toxin ricin (RTB). The resulting hybrid was purified by a combination of gel filtration and affinity chromatography on acid-washed Sepharose 4B. This model suicide transport agent was assayed in vitro against K-562 cells and was found to be cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner (ID50 = 0.15 micrograms/ml). Lactose inhibited the toxicity of the hybrid, indicating that cytotoxicity was dependent on the cell binding property of the ricin B moiety. In addition, free RIP and free ricin B, either alone or in combination, were nontoxic over this concentration range. The in vivo effects of the RTB-RIP hybrid were assessed by pressure microinjection into the vagus nerves of rats. Injection of 0.18 to 6.5 micrograms of conjugate resulted in death of vagal sensory but not motor neurons after 3-17 days. The cytotoxic changes in vagal sensory neurons were identical to those previously observed with a variety of RIP toxins such as ricin.","['Ovadia, M', 'Wiley, R G', 'Hager, C', 'LaRocca, C', 'Oeltmann, T N']","['Ovadia M', 'Wiley RG', 'Hager C', 'LaRocca C', 'Oeltmann TN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxins/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Edible Grain/*toxicity', 'Hordeum/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Male', 'Plant Lectins', 'Plant Proteins/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Ribosomes/*drug effects', 'Ricin/*toxicity', 'Vagus Nerve/drug effects']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1988 Jul;264(1):168-75. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(88)90582-6.,"['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']","['0003-9861(88)90582-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(88)90582-6 [doi]']",,,,,

At the time of study, the mean height was -1.5 SD score below the mean, less than genetic potential, and significantly less than the mean pretreatment height of -0.25 SD score. Height velocity was subnormal for age and sexual stage in all patients. Two patients had compensated hypothyroidism, and four had evidence of gonadal failure. In 11 patients, the peak GH level after two provocative tests was below 10 micrograms/L, which was consistent with GH deficiency. In ten of 13 patients tested, spontaneous GH secretion determined by a 24-hour GH concentration (GHC), GH pulse amplitude, frequency of GH pulses greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/L, and GH peak during wake and sleep hours was significantly less than in normal height controls. Although in three pubertal patients the 24-hour GHC was within normal limits, the GHC during sleep hours, GH pulse amplitude during 24 hours and sleep hours, and peak GH during wake hours were significantly less than in normal height controls. In all pubertal and in two of the prepubertal patients, the somatomedin C (SmC) level was significantly less than in controls. The 24-hour GHC correlated well with the GHC during sleep, peak-stimulated GH level, gonadal steroid level, and the SmC level, but not with height velocity, dose of radiation, or age at radiation. A significant increase in height velocity and the SmC level was noted in all patients treated with GH. These results indicate that GH deficiency occurs after 18 to 24 Gy of cranial radiation and that the puberty-associated growth spurt may mask the decline in height velocity owing to GH deficiency. In some patients treated with cranial radiation, a subtle dysregulation in spontaneous GH secretion may exist despite a normal GH response to provocative testing.","['Costin, G']",['Costin G'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Growth Hormone/blood/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/blood/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Puberty/radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sexual Maturation/radiation effects']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1988 Aug;142(8):847-52. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1988.02150080053022.,"['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles, CA 90027.']",['10.1001/archpedi.1988.02150080053022 [doi]'],,,,,

This differentiation is accompanied by an arrest in cell proliferation. Studies have implicated alterations in the phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition as a result of HL-60 differentiation. However, changes in FA's are also known to occur during the arrest of cellular proliferation. Using a highly efficient capillary gas-liquid chromatography technique, the phospholipid FA composition of HL-60 and of DMSO-resistant and RA-resistant HL-60 subclones was determined in proliferating cells, in density-arrested cells, and in terminally differentiated cells. The same specific modifications in some of the FAs of the three cell lines were observed when proliferation was inhibited by cell density; 16:0 and 18:2n-6 were decreased and 22:6n-3 increased. Moreover, 16 and 18 dimetylacetals were both increased when proliferation was decreased, indicating modifications in plasmalogen contents. Granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells and of its subclones with DMSO and/or RA provoked modifications in phospholipid FAs different from that found in density-arrested, undifferentiated cells such as decreases in monoenoic FAs of 16 and 18 carbons as well as an increase in arachidonic acid, the major polyunsaturated FA. The biological significance of these changes upon arrest of proliferation and differentiation are discussed. These results indicate that, when arrest of proliferation accompanies differentiation, these two phenomena can be responsible for different changes and, whenever possible, they have to be considered separately in order to know which modifications are effectively due to differentiation itself.","['Geny, B', 'Lagarde, M', 'Ladoux, A', 'Abita, J P']","['Geny B', 'Lagarde M', 'Ladoux A', 'Abita JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jul;2(7):459-65.,"['Unite INSERM 204, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,

Consequently, we further studied this group of adults with ALL to determine if these immunological groups could be distinguished by morphological and cytochemical criteria. Bone marrow films were classified according to French-American-British Co-operative Group Criteria, assessed for myelodysplasia, and examined for blasts with azurophilic granules. More cases of My+ALL had L2 morphology than did My-ALL (68% vs. 49%, p = 0.04), and more cases of My+ALL were positive for acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (61% vs. 31%, p = 0.03). The presence of myelodysplastic changes was not significantly different in My+ALL (13%) as compared to My-ALL (5%), but more cases of My+ALL had unusual blasts (monocytoid features and cytoplasmic buds) than did My-ALL (19% vs. 0%, p less than 0.01). In addition, more cases of My+ALL had greater than 5% of the blasts with azurophilic granules (42% vs. 13%, p = 0.01). In the My+ALL group the presence of azurophilic granules was associated with a longer median survival (13.5 months vs. 1.5 months, p less than 0.01). We conclude that My+ALL can be suspected when cases possess L2 morphology, unusual blasts, positive staining for acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, and greater than 5% azurophilic granules. In addition, the poor risk group (My+ALL) can be further subdivided into better and poorer risk subgroups based on the presence of azurophilic granules.","['Davey, F R', 'Mick, R', 'Nelson, D A', 'MacCallum, J', 'Sobol, R E', 'Royston, I', 'Cuttner, J', 'Ellison, R R', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Davey FR', 'Mick R', 'Nelson DA', 'MacCallum J', 'Sobol RE', 'Royston I', 'Cuttner J', 'Ellison RR', 'Bloomfield CD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jul;2(7):420-6.,"['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Brookline, Massachusetts.']",,"['CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

The ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to suppress allogeneic NK activity was tested in two ALL patients - one with no detectable NK activity, and one with high NK activity. No NK-suppressive activity was found with PBLs of the areactive patient; PBLs of the reactive patients exhibited some suppressive activity, but only at a particular suppressor-to-effector cell ratio. Leukemic blasts were resistant to killing by autologous NK cells stimulated by IFN, as well as to killing by allogeneic, IFN-stimulated PBLs. Leukemic blasts of an ALL patient inhibited lysis of K-562 cells in an 18-h, but not in a 4-h NK assay. The inhibition could partly be reversed by pretreatment of ALL cells with alpha interferon, suggesting that the blasts might inhibit the lysis of K-562 targets in a competitive manner.

We have analyzed, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the phosphoprotein patterns within HL60 cells, labeled to equilibrium with [32P]orthophosphate when cells were treated with suboptimal (1 nM), optimal (5 and 10 nM), and supraoptimal (40 and 100 nM) concentrations of 12-O-tetradecanylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as regards the induction of differentiation. No change was detected in the phosphoprotein pattern at 1 nM TPA, whereas four phosphoproteins showed increased levels of phosphorylation at 5 and 10 nM TPA. When cells were treated with 40 and 100 nM TPA, in total eight and ten proteins, respectively, were phosphorylated, including the above four proteins. Two proteins were dephosphorylated when cells were treated with 40 and 100 nM TPA. A 15-kd protein, phosphorylated when HL60 cells were treated with 5 nM TPA, was observed as an intense spot in autoradiographs of total cellular phosphoproteins of two variant HL60 cell lines that are unable to differentiate toward monocytes and prior to treatment with TPA. In the case of three variant cell lines, which like HL60 differentiate toward monocytes, the phosphoprotein spot was almost absent. Thus, paradoxically, the 15-kd phosphoprotein is affected by TPA although its constitutive level of expression or increased phosphorylation state is inversely related to the potential for monocyte differentiation. This observation, together with the TPA dose-response effects on protein phosphorylation, is discussed in relation to multiple protein kinase involvement.","['Lord, J M', 'Wong, A K', 'Brown, G']","['Lord JM', 'Wong AK', 'Brown G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1988 Aug;16(7):620-6.,"['Department of Immunology, Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",,,,,,

Upon increasing the concentration of DF, or after treatment with DNA-specific anticancer agents, the cells exit the proliferation program and differentiate to monocyte/macrophage-like cells (Y. Honma, C. Honma, and A. Bloch, Cancer Res., 46: 6311-6315, 1986). The study reported here shows that when ML-1 cells, induced to differentiate with DF contained in mitogen-stimulated human leukocyte-conditioned medium (CM) are treated with the carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea, their differentiation program is interrupted and proliferation is resumed at a stably increased rate of growth (doubling time, 25.1 versus 31.3 h). This ""step-up"" transformation is brought about by only a narrow concentration range of carcinogen, acting at a restricted time interval following differentiation induction. The step-up transformed cells are more sensitive to growth factor signals and less sensitive to DF signals than are untreated ML-1 cells. When retreated with a higher concentration of DF and the same concentration of N-nitroso-N-methylurea, the transformed cells undergo a further decrease in doubling time to 21 h. Differentiation-uninduced ML-1 cells do not respond to treatment with N-nitroso-N-methylurea, indicating that differentiation-induced cells, at an early stage of the maturation process, may be the targets for the carcinogen-mediated transformation.","['Guan, X P', 'Bloch, A']","['Guan XP', 'Bloch A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylnitrosourea/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Aug 1;48(15):4389-94.,"['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",,['CA-36241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Flow karyotyping was performed on blood or bone marrow samples from eight patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) after a culture period of four days and arresting the cells in metaphase during the last 16 hours. Discontinuous density gradient centrifugation proved to be essential in removing debris and dead cells from the cell suspensions. By this procedure the mitotic index increase ranged from 2 to 80 times initial values. Chromosomes were isolated and stained with two base pair-specific fluorochromes, ie, chromomycin A3 and Hoechst 33258, and run through a specially designed dual-laser beam flow cytometer. Generally, 20,000 chromosomes or more were measured. The data were computer stored in list mode. Besides the clear detection of the specific Philadelphia chromosome, trisomies and other additional chromosomal aberrations [like an i(17q)] were visualized. Quantitative analysis revealed the percentage of subclones containing a certain chromosomal anomaly. Conventional cytogenetic analysis confirmed these findings. In seven of eight cases, CML could be diagnosed on the basis of the presence of a Philadelphia chromosome in the flow karyogram. In one of these seven, the conventional cytogenetic analysis was unknown at that time. The remaining six all matched the standard cytogenetics. The one failure out of eight could be attributed to the specific stimulating conditions in the culture. Although it is impossible by this technique to determine the position of the breakpoint, the involved chromosomes in the translocation event could be identified.

Additional chromosomal aberrations can be detected provided that changes in the amount of DNA per chromosome have occurred.

During development of terminal blast crisis, successive blood samples showed a progressive decrease in the amount of germline bcr DNA and its complete loss by full blast crisis. There were also increased amounts of rearranged bcr DNA consistent with acquired homozygosity. A similar result was obtained with an IgV lambda probe and indicated homozygosity of a significant part of chromosome 22. The bcr-abl gene complex behaves as a somatic dominant in CML, and we suggest that its acquired homozygosity is a mechanism of bcr-abl amplification similar to duplication of the Ph chromosome commonly found in the blast crisis of CML.","['Reeve, A E', 'Morris, C M', 'Fitzgerald, P H']","['Reeve AE', 'Morris CM', 'Fitzgerald PH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['*Alleles', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*genetics', 'DNA/blood', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):24-8.,"['Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['S0006-4971(20)80546-1 [pii]'],,,,,

The incidence of TdT positive AML was 22.5% and this was significantly higher in poorly differentiated myeloblastic (M0 and M1) types (54%) than in all other FAB subtypes (10%; P less than 0.001). Our findings suggest heterogeneity among TdT positive cases. Whilst the majority correspond to genuine TdT positive AML in which evidence for exclusive myeloid nature was demonstrated by phenotypic, cytochemical and ultrastructural markers, a distinct minority (22%) of cases had mixtures of lymphoid and myeloid blasts. A change in phenotype occurred in three out of six cases studied in relapse. There was no difference in the incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement between TdT positive (two out of 12) and TdT negative (one out of 11) cases, although published data suggests that Ig gene rearrangement is significantly more common in TdT positive cases. The determination of TdT in AML allows the identification of cases of mixed acute leukaemia which probably represent proliferations of multipotent progenitor cells. The majority of TdT positive cases, nevertheless, correspond to immature types of myeloblastic leukaemia which may constitute a clinically distinct subgroup.","['Parreira, A', 'Pombo de Oliveira, M S', 'Matutes, E', 'Foroni, L', 'Morilla, R', 'Catovsky, D']","['Parreira A', 'Pombo de Oliveira MS', 'Matutes E', 'Foroni L', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jun;69(2):219-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07625.x.,"['MRC Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07625.x [doi]'],,,,,

The experiments reported here investigate whether submicroscopic amplification units are present in early passages of the human tumor cell lines HL-60 and COLO 320. The results show that such cells do contain submicroscopic, extrachromosomal, supercoiled circular molecules harboring MYC genes. The molecules in HL-60 are approximately 250 kilobase pairs (kbp), while those in COLO 320 are 120-160 kbp. The extrachromosomal molecules in HL-60 are shown to replicate semiconservatively and approximately once in one cell cycle.

By using partially methylated hybrid molecules, it was shown that methylation-sensitive negative regulatory elements are located in both the 5' and 3' ends of the beta-globin gene but not in the 90-base-pair region usually associated with promoter activity. To further investigate the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of the beta-globin gene, 50-base-pair poly(dG-dC) tracts were introduced into various sites in a mouse-human hybrid gene, and these inserts were methylated by means of the Hha I methylase.

No significant changes could be observed over time, neither induced by the ivGG infusion itself (short term effect) nor during the 20 months observation period (long term effect). Before ivGG therapy was initiated, a positive correlation was found between zymosan opsonisation and complement parameters (CH 50: p less than 0.01; AP 50; p less than 0.001; C3: p less than 0.05). No correlation could be noted between zymosan opsonisation and IgG concentration. Experiments with complement deficient sera clearly demonstrated the dependence of zymosan opsonisation from complement function. In contrast, sera with little or no IgG but intact complement, showed normal zymosan opsonisation. Deficient zymosan opsonisation might contribute to the immune deficiency of ALL patients.

In addition, several types of resistance have been identified. The types of resistance are r- (glucocorticoid binding site loss), ract/l (activation labile receptors) and r+ly- (defective lysis mechanism). The two types of receptor mutants have been examined for the presence and expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. Southern blot analysis, using a full-length cDNA probe for human GR, shows that the gene in both is grossly intact. Examination of the expression of the gene by Northern blots reveals the presence of normal, 7-kb message in both types of receptor mutants, though in amounts somewhat reduced from wild-type. This report focuses on the activation labile mutants. Since characterization of these mutants suggests that they can bind ligand but not retain it during activation, we hypothesized that they would respond normally to a ligand that could not be lost during activation. This seems to be the case. When the covalent affinity ligand dexamethasone mesylate, itself a partial glucocorticoid agonist/antagonist, is used, the ract/l cells are killed to an extent corresponding to that evoked by a sub-optimal concentration of the full agonist dexamethasone. We conclude: (1) that the ract/l receptors can function to kill cells if provided a ligand that they do not lose during activation; (2) that the partial agonist activity of dexamethasone mesylate for cell killing is not due to release of a small amount of free dexamethasone; (3) that the poor agonist activity of dexamethasone mesylate receptor complexes suggests that the role of steroid is strictly to participate in conversion of the receptor to its DNA binding form, after which presence of the steroid actually interferes with proper receptor action.","['Thompson, E B', 'Yuh, Y S', 'Ashraf, J', 'Gametchu, B', 'Johnson, B', 'Harmon, J M']","['Thompson EB', 'Yuh YS', 'Ashraf J', 'Gametchu B', 'Johnson B', 'Harmon JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'O9S11FMA79 (dexamethasone 21-methanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1988;30(1-6):63-70. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(88)90077-5.,"['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550-2779.']",['10.1016/0022-4731(88)90077-5 [doi]'],['R01 CA41407-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Eight gangliosides and ten neutral glycosphingolipids were tested in terms of their induction of phagocytic activities on the leukemia cells. N-Acetyl-neuraminosyllactosylceramide (NAc-GM3) was the most effective glycolipid for inducing the activity. By the addition of 25 micrograms/ml of NAc-GM3, about 70 percent of the cells acquired phagocytic activity within 20 h incubation. GM1a showed about half the activity of the GM3. In the case of the neutral glycosphingolipids, lactosylceramide (CDH) and globotriaosylceramide (CTH) showed significant effects on the induction of phagocytic activity. Preincubation of the cells with the NAc-GM3 enhanced the effect of dexamethasone as a differentiation inducer on M1-T22 cells.

The clearance in tumor-bearing animals was faster than in control mice. The tissue distribution was corrected for nonspecific accumulation by scoring for an unrelated antibody. Calculation of a localization index showed that IC5F5 binds at least 4.5 times more specifically to tumor cells than to other tissues. A preferential localization of radioactivity in s.c. tumor tissue was seen in the scanning of animals injected with 131I-labeled antibodies. The most direct proof of specific binding was observed in autoradiograms of animals treated with 125I-labeled antibodies.

As controls, erythropoietically stimulated spleens from phenylhydrazine-treated mice were studied. Expression of 10 protooncogenes (c-erb-A, c-erb-B, c-ets, c-sis, c-mos, c-rel, c-src, c-fes, c-fms, N-myc [corrected] was not detectable in Friend erythroleukemias. One protooncogene (c-src) was found expressed in normal erythroid cells but not in erythroleukemias. Four protooncogenes (c-fos, c-abl, N-ras, and c-raf) were expressed at low levels in both steps of erythroleukemia. c-fos and c-abl RNAs were barely detectable in normal erythroid cells. High levels of four protooncogene transcripts (c-H-ras, c-K-ras, c-myc, and c-myb) were detected in preleukemic and leukemic tissues. While c-H-ras RNA was found at similar levels in normal and leukemic erythroid cells, c-myc, c-myb, and c-K-ras were not expressed in normal erythroid cells. To determine whether the elevated levels of c-myc, c-myb, and c-K-ras RNAs in erythroleukemic cells are related to the proliferative state or the undifferentiated state of the cells, the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation on oncogene expression in two erythroleukemia cell lines was examined. Terminal differentiation was associated with lack of c-myb expression while c-myc and c-K-ras expression was essentially unaffected. These results suggest that the high levels of c-myb transcripts in erythroleukemias may reflect the undifferentiated state of the leukemic cells. In contrast, the elevated expression of c-myc and c-K-ras at both stages of the Friend diseases is probably not related to the stage of differentiation but rather to the uncontrolled proliferation of the cells. Finally among 18 protooncogenes surveyed, only the accumulation of c-myc and c-K-ras RNAs appears to be associated with the Friend erythroleukemic process before the late leukemic phase develops.","['Robert-Lezenes, J', 'Meneceur, P', 'Ray, D', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F']","['Robert-Lezenes J', 'Meneceur P', 'Ray D', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):3972-6.,"['INSERM U-248, Faculte de Medecine Lariboisiere Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,['Cancer Res 1988 Sep 1;48(17):5056'],,

This case-control study was designed to assess the relation between residential exposure to magnetic fields and the development of childhood cancer. Eligible cases consisted of all 356 residents of the five-county 1970 Denver, Colorado Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with any form of cancer between 1976 and 1983. Controls were selected by random digit dialing to approximate the case distribution by age, sex, and telephone exchange area. Exposure was characterized through in-home electric and magnetic field measurements under low and high power use conditions and wire configuration codes, a surrogate measure of long-term magnetic field levels. Measured magnetic fields under low power use conditions had a modest association with cancer incidence; a cutoff score of 2.0 milligauss resulted in an odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6-2.9) for total cancers and somewhat larger odds ratios (ORs) for leukemias (OR = 1.9), lymphomas (OR = 2.2), and soft tissue sarcomas (OR = 3.3). Neither magnetic fields (OR = 1.0) nor electric fields (OR = 0.9) under high power use conditions were related to total cancers. Wire codes associated with higher magnetic fields were more common among case than control homes. The odds ratio to contrast very high and high to very low, low, and buried wire codes was 1.5 (95% CI = 1.0-2.3) for total cases, with consistency across cancer subgroups except for brain cancer (OR = 2.0) and lymphomas (OR = 0.8). Contrasts of very high to buried wire code homes produced larger, less precise odds ratios of 2.3 for total cases, 2.9 for leukemias, and 3.3 for lymphomas. Adjusted estimates for measured fields and wire codes did not differ from crude results, indicating an absence of confounding. Limitations to the study are nonresponse (especially for field measurements), differential mobility of cases and controls, and a presumably nondifferential exposure misclassification from the use of imperfect surrogates for long-term magnetic field exposure history.

In contrast, a human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) was found to be sensitive to all three compounds.

Guanine was efficiently salvaged by HL-60 cells; at 200 microM, guanine suppressed the formation of 6-TG mononucleotides and abolished 6-TG incorporation into nucleic acids. Similarly, guanine antagonized 6-TG cytotoxicity in a dose dependent fashion. Furthermore, guanine (200 microM) fully suppressed the 6-TG (10 microM) induced HL-60 cell differentiation, which suggests that cell differentiation at pharmacological 6-TG concentrations is dependent on the anabolism of the drug to active nucleotides. 6-TG given alone reduced GTP levels and DNA synthesis rates in HL-60 cells, while a major intracellular 6-TG metabolite, 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate, accumulated to high levels (approximately 100 microM).

HL60 differentiation, induced by various combinations of HMBA and NADAH, reflected a combined effect of the two compounds. In contrast, 1,6-diaminohexane, at 0.5-5 mM, failed to induce HL60 differentiation. Similarly, 0.5-5 mM 6-acetamidohexanoic acid, the major metabolite of HMBA, and 6-aminohexanoic acid failed to induce differentiation of HL60 cells. However, 6-acetamidohexanoic acid, when combined with HMBA or NADAH at various concentrations and ratios, enhanced the differentiation of HL60 cells induced by these two compounds. This enhancement was most apparent with addition of 0.50-3.0 mM 6-acetamidohexanoic acid to HL60 cells incubated with 1.0-3.0 mM HMBA or 0.25-1.0 mM NADAH. 6-Aminohexanoic acid similarly enhanced HMBA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. These in vitro results have implications in terms of the clinical application of HMBA and interpretation of the results of clinical trials performed to date and may provide some insight into the mechanism of HMBA-induced cellular differentiation.","['Snyder, S W', 'Egorin, M J', 'Geelhaar, L A', 'Hamburger, A W', 'Callery, P S']","['Snyder SW', 'Egorin MJ', 'Geelhaar LA', 'Hamburger AW', 'Callery PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 1;48(13):3613-6.,"['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",,['N01-CM47734/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

Relapse of myelodysplasia occurred at a median of 147 weeks (50-520) from presentation and in two instances was followed a year later by AML. In five cases, myelodysplastic relapse was treated with low-dose cytosine arabinoside given alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Three patients remain in CR after 1, 2 and 5 years. The reappearance of myelodysplastic features in these six patients was strongly correlated with the presence of TMDS at presentation of the AML. It was not observed once in the 136 AML patients, treated similarly, who did not have associated TMDS at presentation (P less than 0.001).

At 0.3 microM and 1.0 microM RA there were significant differences between the CML chronic phase and the CML blastic phase patients (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.05 respectively). At these concentrations there was no significant inhibition on normal bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Inhibition was independent of the proportions of progenitors in S phase, as assessed by tritiated thymidine suicide. Preincubation of cells from selected patients with RA for 48 hours before culture in agar resulted in a significant degree of inhibition (48 +/- 8% of control). Inhibition was prevented by delaying the addition of RA from 24 to 48 hours from the beginning of the culture, indicating that RA exerts an early direct effect on myeloid progenitors.","['Januszewicz, E', 'Rabizadah, E', 'Maimon, Z', 'Zaizov, R', 'Shaklai, M']","['Januszewicz E', 'Rabizadah E', 'Maimon Z', 'Zaizov R', 'Shaklai M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1988 Jan;20(1):1-6. doi: 10.3109/00313028809085187.,"['Division of Hematology, Beilison Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['10.3109/00313028809085187 [doi]'],,,,,

These patients have long-term follow-up, and the probability of cure is estimated at approximately 35%. The cause-specific hazard rate analysis found lower rates of achieving complete remission (CR) in patients with WBC greater than 10,000/microL, AUL (undifferentiated) morphology, and older age. Since these patients required additional time to respond, fewer of them actually achieved CR. Characteristics directly associated with a higher rate of death during induction therapy due to severe bone marrow suppression were low serum albumin concentration (less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL), age greater than 50 years, acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) morphology, low Karnofsky performance status, and weight loss greater than 5%. Factors associated with a higher rate of relapse were WBC greater than 20,000/microL, non-T cell ALL, age greater than 60 years, Ph' + ALL, and time to achieve CR greater than 5 weeks. These criteria were used to identify patients at high risk of relapse. In addition, the predictive value of high WBC was found to disappear by 18 months of continuous CR. Finally, the rate of death following first relapse was higher in patients with a short first remission duration, high percentage weight loss at initial diagnosis, and older age. In summary, factors associated with a higher rate of death during attempted induction (ie, low albumin, high percent weight loss, and poor performance status) had no association with the patient's ability to remain relapse-free. Conversely, factors correlating with more extensive or resistant disease (ie, high WBC, null or B cell ALL, or Ph' + ALL) showed no association with the ability to tolerate therapy. Thus, a less toxic but more effective induction regimen is needed for patients with a poor clinical status, whereas a more intensive form of therapy appears warranted for patients presenting with more extensive or resistant disease.","['Gaynor, J', 'Chapman, D', 'Little, C', 'McKenzie, S', 'Miller, W', 'Andreeff, M', 'Arlin, Z', 'Berman, E', 'Kempin, S', 'Gee, T']","['Gaynor J', 'Chapman D', 'Little C', 'McKenzie S', 'Miller W', 'Andreeff M', 'Arlin Z', 'Berman E', 'Kempin S', 'Gee T', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Jun;6(6):1014-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.6.1014.,"['Division of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.6.1014 [doi]'],"['CA-05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['J Clin Oncol 1988 Sep;6(9):1522'],,

Production of fos and myc RNA was measured by S1 mapping, using fos DNA probes which identified either primary unspliced transcripts or steady-state-spliced mRNA levels, and using a myc probe which spanned the two major c-myc start sites, P1 and P2. Pretreatment of a quiescent KG-1 cell population with IFN for 18 hours before serum addition decreased the stimulation of both fos and myc RNA production. In HL-60 and U937 cells, IFN pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on serum-induced fos or myc transcription; however, in U937, rIFN-alpha 2 treatment alone stimulated fos mRNA 11-fold. Expression of 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase was induced in IFN-treated cultures but not in cells stimulated with serum alone. No serum-induced IFN-alpha 1 or IFN-beta 1 gene expression was observed in KG-1 or U937 cells.

S., Baker, V. V., and May, W. S. (1987) Oncogene 1, 91-100). However, whereas PBt2 causes HL-60 cells to cease dividing and differentiate, bryostatin 1 antagonizes this effect and allows cells to continue proliferating. To test whether these divergent effects could be due to the differential activation of protein kinase C at the nuclear level, the phosphorylation of nuclear envelope polypeptides was evaluated in cells treated with either bryostatin 1 or PBt2. Bryostatin 1, either alone or in combination with PBt2, but not PBt2 alone, mediates rapid and specific phosphorylation of several nuclear envelope polypeptides. A major target for bryostatin-induced phosphorylation is the major nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B (Mr = 67,000, pI 6.0). In vitro studies combining purified protein kinase C and HL-60 cell nuclear envelopes demonstrate that bryostatin activates protein kinase C to phosphorylate lamin B, whereas PBt2 does so only weakly, suggesting selective activation of this enzyme toward this substrate. Comparative phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analyses demonstrate that bryostatin induces phosphorylation of identical serine sites on lamin B both in whole cells and in vitro. Treatment of whole cells with bryostatin, but not PBt2, leads to specific translocation of activated protein kinase C to the nuclear envelope. Since phosphorylation of lamin B is known to be involved in nuclear lamina depolymerization at the time of mitosis, it is possible that bryostatin-activated protein kinase C activity is involved in this process. Finally, specific activation of protein kinase C at the nuclear membrane could explain, at least in part, the divergent effects of bryostatin 1 and PBt2 on HL-60 cell growth.","['Fields, A P', 'Pettit, G R', 'May, W S']","['Fields AP', 'Pettit GR', 'May WS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Bryostatins', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Jun 15;263(17):8253-60.,"['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21231.']",['S0021-9258(18)68471-6 [pii]'],"['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

Our study suggests that the rearranged chromosomes, i.e., Ph1 and t(9;22), are closer together than their normal homologues. This impression is based on extensive statistical analysis. The intimate relationship may be due to the fact that they carry reciprocal genetic material responsible for a power of attraction between them. Alternatively, it is tempting to hypothesize that there may be a DNA sequence homology in the bands of chromosomes 9q and 22q involved in the reciprocal translocation perpetuating this relationship in subsequently generating cells during mitotic cell divisions.

We have examined the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of cells for factors affecting the metabolism of mRNA.

The factor is non-dialysable, inactivated by proteinase K and heat treatment, and resistant to RNase and DNase digestion. The HeLa cell factor resembles placental RNase inhibitor in that the mRNA-protecting activity is effective against RNase A and that treatment of the extract with N-ethylmaleimide completely destroys the protective activity. However, purified placental RNase inhibitor was unable to inhibit the RNase activity in the MELC cytoplasmic extract. These results suggest that the HeLa cell extract contains an RNase inhibitor (or inhibitors) with an activity or specificity that is distinct from that of placental RNase inhibitor.","['Stolle, C A', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Stolle CA', 'Benz EJ Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA Caps)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Half-Life', 'HeLa Cells/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Placenta/analysis', 'RNA Caps/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1988;62(1):65-74. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(88)90580-x.,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']","['0378-1119(88)90580-X [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(88)90580-x [doi]']",['HL 24385/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

The frequency of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) increased dose dependently. While there were no significant differences between normal and leukemic cells with regard to the induction of chromosome aberrations, the frequency of SCE was significantly lower in Ph-positive cells than in normal bone marrow. This difference was not only apparent on the basis of the SCE frequency per cell, but also when the SCE frequency was correlated to the relative chromosome length as shown by the SCE rate per chromosome group. Longitudinal studies of three patients who received long term busulfan treatment did not show a significant change in the frequency of induced SCE. It can be suggested that the lower frequency of induced SCE in Ph-positive cells reveals less sensitivity of the leukemic cells to DNA damage by busulfan. Our data provide evidence for the inability of busulfan treatment to eradicate or even reduce Ph-positive cells in chronic myeloid leukemia. Evaluation of cell proliferation by sister chromatid differentiation shows longer cell cycle times for the Ph-positive cells. Busulfan affected the cell cycle duration of leukemia and normal cells very little.","['Becher, R', 'Prescher, G']","['Becher R', 'Prescher G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jun 15;48(12):3435-9.,"['Innere Universitats- und Poliklinik (Tumorforschung), Westdeutsches Tumorzentrum, Essen 1, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,

In FEL cells which were no longer actively dividing (stationary phase), eEF-Tu mRNA was found to be rather stable, with a t1/2 of about 24 h. In rapidly growing FEL cells eEF-Tu mRNA was considerably less stable, with a t1/2 of about 9 h. In both cases a single rate of mRNA decay was observed. However, when stationary-phase cells resumed growth after treatment with fresh medium, we observed that eEF-Tu mRNA decay followed a biphasic process. The faster of the two decay rates involved approximately 50% of the eEF-Tu mRNA and had a t1/2 of about 1 h.

Cell measurements were obtained in 37 evaluable patients during their first remission induction treatment with DNR and cytarabine (ara-C) and directly compared with the plasma distribution kinetics of DNR. We show that (1) plasma DNR concentrations do not correlate with DNR concentrations in bone marrow nucleated cells; but (2) plasma area under the curve (AUC) values of DNR correlate inversely (P less than .01) with AUC values of DNR in WBCs; (3) concentrations of DNR in WBCs correlate positively (P less than .01) with DNR concentrations in bone marrow nucleated cells; and (4) the concentrations of DNR in WBCs show a negative correlation (P less than .01) with the numbers of peripheral blast cells at diagnosis. We then tested whether the pharmacokinetic parameters had predictive value for the clinical outcome of therapy, but none of the plasma levels or WBC and bone marrow concentrations of DNR predicted treatment outcome. The inverse correlation between the concentrations of DNR in WBC and the numbers of peripheral blast cells suggests that the effective DNR concentrations achieved intracellularly are mainly a function of the tumor load so that lesser amounts of DNR accumulate intracellularly when the AML cell numbers in blood are higher.","['Kokenberg, E', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Sizoo, W', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Kokenberg E', 'Sonneveld P', 'Sizoo W', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 May;6(5):802-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.5.802.,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Rotterdam Radio-Therapeutic Institute, The Netherlands.']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.5.802 [doi]'],,,,,

The kinetics of transferrin receptor cycle in bone marrow erythroblasts was obtained by pulse-chase experiments before the initiation of therapy. Internalization of transferrin was impaired and resulted in a delayed peak of internalized transferrin, as compared with the kinetics pattern seen in healthy subjects. The subsequent exocytosis of the internalized ligand was also delayed. Thus, transferrin receptor cycle seems to be influenced all along the transferrin pathway, hence transferrin travels more slowly in erythroblasts in erythroleukemia. The altered transferrin receptor cycle led to a diminished iron uptake per surface transferrin receptor (approximately 30% of that in healthy subjects), and the incorporation of iron into heme was greatly reduced. Our observations suggest a possible role for the altered transferrin receptor cycle in the pathogenesis of defective heme synthesis and ineffective erythropoiesis in erythroleukemia.","['Muta, K', 'Nishimura, J', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Ideguchi, H', 'Katsuno, M', 'Ibayashi, H']","['Muta K', 'Nishimura J', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ideguchi H', 'Katsuno M', 'Ibayashi H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Endocytosis', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Exocytosis', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1988 Apr;40(4):309-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00183.x.,"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00183.x [doi]'],,,,,

On the other hand, 10 nM Ara-C partially inhibited the toxicity of 100 microM 5HmdUrd. Radioactive 5HmdUrd was incorporated into DNA, but not RNA, the rate being 5% of that observed with thymidine. [3H]5HmdUrd-derived radioactivity remained stable in DNA for at least 24 h, indicating that the compound was not excised to a significant extent from DNA in these conditions. The incorporation of Ara-C and 5HmdUrd into DNA appeared to take place via different pathways, which is a second explanation for their synergism.

Thirty-seven patients had received 32P radiotherapy and/or alkylating agents during the chronic phase, eight had received other cytotoxic drugs, and ten had received a noncytotoxic treatment. The duration of chronic phase ranged from 1 to 29 years (mean, 9.2 years). Nineteen karyotypes were established at the onset of transformation, when the percentage of bone marrow blasts was still low; 31 were performed at an overt acute leukemia stage, and five were carried out at both stages. Clonal abnormalities were seen in 96.3% of the karyotypes, of which 80.0% were structural defects, 20.0% hypoploidies, 36.4% hyperploidies, and 36.4% complex karyotypes or karyotypes with variations. In 20 cases the chromosome changes were of the type usually found in secondary leukemias; however, no clear relationship could be established between chromosomal defects and chronic phase treatments.

This result then allows intracellular metabolism and incorporation into DNA to proceed to the maximum extent possible. In addition, the increased synthesis of ara-CDP-choline associated with these high doses may serve as an alternate substrate for phosphatidyl choline synthesis, which may contribute to membrane fragility and cell lysis. HiDAC also serves as a ""prodrug"" for high concentrations of ara-U, which in turn diminishes ara-C catabolism with a prolonged gamma phase of systemic clearance and also causes cytostasis in S-phase with enhanced anabolism and cytotoxicity of subsequent doses of ara-C.

The dermal infiltrate in one of the nodules consisted predominantly of closely packed pleomorphic Langerhans' cells (LC) with typical Birbeck granules and a strong reactivity for S-100 protein. The simultaneous presence of immature myeloid cells led to the suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder. The diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was subsequently confirmed by bone marrow histology and blood picture. Although some peritrabecular foci of histiocytic cells were detected in bone marrow, no LC could be identified by electron microscopy and histochemical methods. Tumorous aggregates of LC in myeloproliferative disorders have not been described in the literature. Histiocytosis X and related diseases could be definitely excluded in the present case. This case obviously suggests an interrelation between the myeloproliferative disease and the focal accumulation of LC in the dermis. In animal studies by Katz et al. LC have been shown to originate in the bone marrow, whereas the origin of LC in man is still a matter of discussion. The present case supports the hypothesis that LC in man are also of myeloid origin. The neoplastic blood monocytes could be the precursors of the dermal LC.

The relative abundance of one mRNA, designated 2B5, increases during retinoic acid-induced differentiation; this increase can be accounted for, in part at least, by a marked increase in the rate of transcription of the gene. The relative abundance of the second, pCG56, decreases during retinoic acid-induced differentiation although the rate of transcription of this gene also increases during the course of differentiation. The bulk of pCG56 transcripts, though polyadenylated and apparently fully processed, are located in the nuclei of the uninduced cells, but on the polysomes of the induced cells. The data indicate that the change in the expression of the gene encoding pCG56 RNA is regulated differently from that encoding 2B5 RNA, and are interpreted as evidence that the pCG56 gene is regulated by an interaction between transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls.

We used numerical clonal chromosomal abnormalities, which are readily detected, to indicate neoplasia, and monoclonal antibodies in an alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase detection procedure to identify lineages as granulocytic-monocytic, erythrocytic, or megakaryocytic. Examination of bone marrow from 12 patients with AML showed metaphases of granulocytic-monocytic lineage with abnormal karyotypes in all patients. In seven patients, we also detected abnormal karyotypes in the erythrocytic or megakaryocytic lineage. In all four patients with monosomy 7, both granulocytic-monocytic and erythrocytic cells were affected. Two of four patients with trisomy 8 also had evidence of multiple-lineage involvement, but in two the erythrocytic lineage had normal karyotypes, suggesting an origin at a progenitor-cell stage committed to granulocytic-monocytic development. Multiple-lineage involvement was found in AML both arising de novo (four of five analyzable cases) and following another cancer (three of four analyzable cases). These data demonstrate multiple-lineage involvement in a high proportion of cases of AML and suggest that many cases originate from the multipotent hematopoietic cell or from an earlier progenitor cell.","['Keinanen, M', 'Griffin, J D', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Machnicki, J', 'de la Chapelle, A']","['Keinanen M', 'Griffin JD', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Machnicki J', 'de la Chapelle A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology']",1988/05/05 00:00,1988/05/05 00:01,['1988/05/05 00:00'],"['1988/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1988 May 5;318(18):1153-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198805053181803.,"['Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['10.1056/NEJM198805053181803 [doi]'],"['CA 19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

The presenting signs and symptoms and the course of the disease were analyzed and compared to 10 patients with persisting reactive thrombocytosis selected from 6,000 patients with reactive thrombocytosis and to 50 patients with other myeloproliferative diseases. 54 ET-patients presented with complications, 46 with thrombembolic, 3 with hemorrhagic problems and 5 with thrombembolic and hemorrhagic problems. In 6 patients ET was detected accidentally. Disturbances of the microcirculation, mainly of the fingers and the toes, were the most frequent symptom. The average maximal platelet count was 1,207,000/microliter. The average platelet count at diagnosis was 880,000/microliter. 16 patients had an elevation of the serum creatinine at diagnosis, which deteriorated during the course of the disease. Bone marrow examinations were performed in 56 patients, histology in 48 patients, cytology in 29 patients. In contrast to the clinical diagnosis the histological diagnosis was in 4 cases each polycythemia vera and myeloproliferative syndrome without further specification. 12 patients died thus far.

While many patients with testicular involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia have enlarged or firm testes, clinical examination alone is insufficient to establish or exclude the diagnosis completely. Open biopsy generally has been used to document the presence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, this procedure requires general anesthesia and hospitalization. We studied 11 patients with a history and/or physical findings suspicious for testicular acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse to determine the efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of the testes for leukemic infiltration. Of the 11 patients fine needle aspiration cytology correctly identified all 5 patients with histologically proved testicular acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it was negative in 5 with no histological evidence of leukemia and it demonstrated rare atypical cells that were not evident on subsequent histological examination in 1.

Whereas the endogenous K562 beta-globin gene is repressed in K562 cells, when introduced into mouse erythroleukemia cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the beta-globin gene from K562 cells was transcribed and induced 5-20-fold after treatment of the cells with dimethyl sulfoxide. The transcripts were correctly initiated, and expression and regulation of the K562 gene were identical to the expression of a normal human beta-globin gene transferred into mouse erythroleukemia cells in the same way. We have also introduced the normal human beta-globin gene into K562 cells using the same retrovirus vector. SP6 analysis of the RNA isolated from the transduced cells showed that the normal beta-globin gene was transcribed at a moderately high level, before or after treatment with hemin. Based on these data, we suggest that the lack of expression of the endogenous beta-globin gene in K562 cells does not result from an alteration in the gene itself and may not result from a lack of factor(s) necessary for beta-globin gene transcription.

Purified mitotic chromosomes from Friend erythroleukemia cells were treated either with increasing NaCl concentrations up to 500 mM, or with 6 M urea in the presence or absence of 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The main criterion for the intactness of the overall chromosome shape as seen by electron microscopy was the characteristic X- or U-like appearance with clearly discernable chromatid axes. Histone H1 is known to be essential for the integrity of chromatin fibres. Its removal in sucrose gradients containing 500 mM NaCl did not lead to loss of the overall chromosome shape. However, treatment of chromosomes in sucrose gradients containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 6 M urea led to loss of the structure probably due to dissociation (or denaturation) of shape-determining (scaffolding) components.

In nonreducing buffers, SDS PAGE analysis of membrane pellets demonstrates that ""native"" membrane IgM exists as a dimer. In contrast to osmotic lysis, lysis of cells with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 releases approximately 90% of the membrane-bound IgM into the supernatant; approximately 10% of the IgM pellets with the cytoskeletal fraction on centrifugation. Ligand challenge with either mu-chain-specific antibodies or concanavalin A induces a change in the state of membrane IgM making it refractory to detergent extraction, such that 43% of the IgM pellets during centrifugation. This ligand-induced retention of IgM is significantly diminished by the microfilament-disrupting agent cytochalasin D, whereas pretreatment of cells with sodium azide or colchicine results in no significant change in the percentage of membrane IgM retained by Triton X-100 residues. These results indicate that retention of IgM involves an association with the cortical actin-based cytoskeleton. Investigation of the structural basis for ligand-induced Triton X-100 retention of membrane IgM by using ferritin-conjugated antibodies, myosin subfragment S1, and stereo-imaging electron microscopy has revealed linkages between ligand-receptor (antigen-IgM) complexes and elements of the cortical actin-based cytoskeleton.","['Salisbury, J L', 'Baron, A T', 'Keller, G A', 'Skiest, D']","['Salisbury JL', 'Baron AT', 'Keller GA', 'Skiest D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*isolation & purification']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1988;9(2):140-52. doi: 10.1002/cm.970090206.,"['Department of Developmental Genetics and Anatomy, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland.']",['10.1002/cm.970090206 [doi]'],"['CA-06576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GMS 29321/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07592/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,

In contrast to c-myc, the level of class I HLA mRNA, as an internal control, was not diminished by PGA2 treatment. Further, this reduction of c-myc was not disturbed by cycloheximide, suggesting that this PGA2 action on c-myc expression is independent of de novo protein synthesis. Cytofluorometric analysis revealed that the exposure of HL-60 cells to PGA2 at 0.5 or 5.0 micrograms/ml arrested the cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. This accumulation of the cells in G0-G1 phase continues until 24 or 36 h at 0.5 or 5.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. The G0-G1 arrest of the cell cycle was also recovered as the inhibition of c-myc was released. This recovery may be due to the loss of activity of PGA2 in culture medium.

The activities of protein kinase C from the two cell types differed in their requirements for the cofactors Ca2+ and lipids. These enzyme activities also differed in their abilities to phosphorylate protamine and a series of four oligopeptides. We suggest that the differences in vitro in the activities of protein kinase C between HL-205 and HL-525 cells, especially in their substrate specificity, are closely related to the different phosphorylation patterns induced in vivo by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in these cells.

In infant and regenerating bone marrow (BM), 41.5% +/- 4.0% of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT+) cells were Ki67+, and 30.0% +/- 4.0% incorporated BrdU.

Thus, ALLs derive from actively proliferating lymphoid precursors but have a lower dividing capacity than the corresponding normal cell types.

Verapamil, chloroquine, and related drugs have been shown previously to be capable of enhancing anticancer drug cytotoxicity in multi-drug-resistant cells, but the mechanism(s) by which these agents do this is(are) unclear. Since these agents did not seem to have common features, we studied these and other compounds for their ability to ""modulate"" Vinca alkaloid resistance in order to determine whether they possessed any common chemical or physical features. In addition to verapamil, 24 compounds, consisting of indole alkaloids, lysosomotropic agents, and amines, were tested for their ability to enhance the cytotoxicity of vinblastine and/or vincristine in our human leukemic multidrug-resistant cell line, CEM/VLB100. Seventeen compounds that enhance the cytotoxicity of the Vinca alkaloids by more than 5-fold have been identified. These include quinolines (chloroquine, quinine, chinchonidine, and primaquine), acridines (acridine, acridine orange, and quinacrine), and indole alkaloids (yohimbine, corynanthine, reserpine, physostigmine, and the vindoline and catharanthine moieties of the Vinca alkaloids), as well as other alkaloids and amines (chlorpromazine, propranolol, atropine, and tryptamine). Vindoline, catharanthine, and quinacrine also enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and teniposide in these cells, indicating that this ""modulation"" was not limited to Vinca alkaloids. We examined some well known lysosomotropic compounds (methylamine, epinephrine, suramin, and trypan blue) and found that they were not able to enhance the cytotoxicity of vincristine in the CEM/VLB100 cells, indicating that lysosomotropic activity per se is not required for modulator activity. Three-dimensional computer modeling permitted molecular comparisons of conformationally related congeners of vinblastine, vindoline, and verapamil and revealed three regions of structural homology. We measured the hydrophobicity (by oil/water partitioning) and calculated the molar refractivity (by the additive substituent constant method) of active and inactive compounds. We found that those cationic agents--verapamil, quinacrine, indole alkaloids, and quinolines--that were lipid soluble at physiologic pH and had similar molar refractivities were best able to enhance the cytotoxicity of the Vinca alkaloids in our multidrug-resistant cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Zamora, J M', 'Pearce, H L', 'Beck, W T']","['Zamora JM', 'Pearce HL', 'Beck WT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chloroquine/therapeutic use', 'Computer Simulation', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Naphthacenes/therapeutic use', 'Podophyllotoxin/therapeutic use', 'Quinacrine/therapeutic use', 'Verapamil/therapeutic use', 'Vinca Alkaloids/therapeutic use']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1988 Apr;33(4):454-62.,"[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Clonogenic cells were found to be most frequently positive with anti-HLA-DR (positive in 100% cases) and RFB-1 (71%) Mabs, with significant reactivity also being seen with CD-33 (69%) and CD-13 (61%) myeloid specific antibodies. CD-11b and CD-15 antigens, expressed predominantly on mature leucocytes, were not significantly expressed on the clonogenic population. Interestingly, the CD-34 antigen, detected by MY-10 Mab on normal myeloid progenitor cells, was demonstrated on the clonogenic fraction of only one of seven cases tested. A discrepancy between antigen expression of clonogenic cells and immunophenotype of the total leukaemic population was frequently seen, with ""early"" markers (CD-33, HLA-DR, RFB-1) expressed on a higher proportion of the clonogenic fraction than the overall population, while the converse was the case for the ""later"" marker, CD-11b. Based on the known normal distribution of differentiation antigens, particularly the CD-13 antigen, cases could be ranked according to clonogenic phenotype into immature (CD-13- HLA-DR+ CD-33+ or CD-33-; five cases), and mature (CD-13+ HLA-DR+ CD-33+; eight cases), levels.

Target cell metabolic activities, possibly involving endocytosis, are crucial for expression of cytotoxicity.",2686-94,"In a previous study, potent tumor cytolysis mediated by human neutrophil peptide defensins occurred slowly over 3 to 15 h. Because these kinetics suggested a requirement for target cell metabolic processes before tumor killing could be realized, the mechanism of lysis by these purified peptides was further investigated. 125I-labeled defensin bound extensively to peptide-sensitive K562 targets with biphasic kinetics. Binding was inhibited in parallel with cytotoxicity when both assays were performed at low temperature or in the presence of FCS. The albumin content of serum could account for the inhibitory effects of FCS. Cytotoxicity was also antagonized by agents that interfered with target cell energy metabolism (azide and 2-deoxyglucose), the cytoskeletal apparatus (cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B), lysosomal function (NH4Cl and chloraquin), or calmodulin-mediated activities (trifluoperazine). FCS also completely removed membrane-bound defensin when it was added after 5 min of binding at 37 degrees C. However, significantly less defensin was removed when FCS was added at later time points after binding was initiated. Cytochalasin B and azide/2-deoxyglucose did not prevent binding of defensin to targets but it significantly inhibited the development of FCS resistance in membrane-bound peptide. However, these two classes of inhibitors acted during distinct time windows: cytochalasin-sensitive events were complete by 1 h, whereas azide/2-deoxyglucose continued to be inhibitory when added as late as 2 h after defensins. These latter data indicated that critical energy-dependent events continue after the cytochalasin-sensitive phase has been completed. The results suggest that defensin-mediated cytotoxicity requires initial binding of defensin molecules to targets and subsequent cytoskeletal- and energy-dependent translocation or internalization. Although the defensins are low m.w. peptides, the initial processes required for their cytotoxic activity resemble those of more complex bacterial, plant and mammalian cytotoxins.","['Lichtenstein, A K', 'Ganz, T', 'Nguyen, T M', 'Selsted, M E', 'Lehrer, R I']","['Lichtenstein AK', 'Ganz T', 'Nguyen TM', 'Selsted ME', 'Lehrer RI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Defensins', '*Endocytosis', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1988/04/15 00:00,1988/04/15 00:01,['1988/04/15 00:00'],"['1988/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Apr 15;140(8):2686-94.,"['Department of Medicine, VA Wadsworth-UCLA Medical Center 90073.']",,"['AI 22839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 35640/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

Since the amount of protein per cell decreases 4-fold during this 4-day period, the amount of transferrin receptor protein, relative to total soluble cell protein, increases 4-fold during this time, suggesting continued synthesis of the receptor. Supporting this, we show that the amount of transferrin receptor transcript in equal amounts of total cell RNA also increases as differentiation proceeds. Uninduced cells maintain 52% of the total transferrin binding sites on the cell surface, whereas only 22% of the receptors are on the surface in 4-day induced cells. All ligand endocytosed by either uninduced or induced cells at 37 degrees C is rapidly and completely exocytosed from the cells, suggesting that all of the cellular receptors are cycling. These studies suggest that, during MEL cell differentiation, an increasing fraction of transferrin receptors are localized to the cell interior, but are nevertheless cycling to the cell surface. This observed redistribution is due to altered kinetic parameters of the receptor. Receptor-bound 125I-labeled transferrin ligand has been followed through a single endocytic cycle. Ligand internalization occurs much more rapidly in induced cells (t1/2 = 2.9 min) than in uninduced cells (t1/2 = 6.9 min). The rates for ligand movement back out to the cell surface and its subsequent release into the medium in both uninduced and induced cells are quite similar.","['Mulford, C A', 'Lodish, H F']","['Mulford CA', 'Lodish HF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Endocytosis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1988/04/15 00:00,1988/04/15 00:01,['1988/04/15 00:00'],"['1988/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Apr 15;263(11):5455-61.,"['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']",['S0021-9258(18)60738-0 [pii]'],"['GM09566/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35012/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL27375/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,

The expression of these genes is well correlated with the appearance of CFU-E during induction of TSA8 cells, and is higher in the CFU-E-cells enriched from mouse fetal livers than in the more differentiated erythroid cells.

The role of protooncogenes.,133-42,"Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is often preceded by a preleukemic phase that can be characterized by a reduction in hematopoiesis, by ineffective hematopoiesis, or by a myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic state. The time between onset of the preleukemic state and the appearance of leukemia is quite variable, and at times such evolution does not occur. These clinical observations are compatible with the multistep hypothesis of tumor development. In studies underway in our laboratory, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is being used as a model system to study the steps in and possible mechanisms underlying the development of preleukemia and its evolution to acute leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is particularly suited for this role because the chronic phase of the disease is an easily identifiable myeloproliferative state that invariably evolves into acute leukemia. In the discussion that follows, this clinical entity is used to develop a general model for the preleukemias and their evolution to acute leukemia.","['Preisler, H D']",['Preisler HD'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Models, Genetic', 'Preleukemia/*genetics/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1988 May;32(1):133-42. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(88)90320-2.,"['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']","['0165-4608(88)90320-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(88)90320-2 [doi]']",['CA-41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,

The short period from the appearance of hematological symptoms to death, the relatively low percentage of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, the high frequency of erythroleukemia, i.e., 50% of leukemia patients, and a case of atypical megakaryocyte proliferation were revealed in leukemia patients. Leukemic cell infiltration in the spleen tended to become slight or minimal with the progress of fibrosis. As a result, the degree of spleen swelling was mild or lacking in leukemia patients who had been administered Thorotrast. On the other hand, cases such as hyperplastic or normoplastic bone marrow, an increase in immature granulocytic series or no decrease in the number of megakaryocytes were observed in aplastic anemia of Thorotrast-administered patients. It was thought that fibrosis in the bone marrow as well as in the spleen was induced by Thorotrast deposition. Thus, in hematological disorders of Thorotrast-administered patients, both leukemia and aplastic anemia cases were considered to be mainly of the atypical type, and it was speculated that the damage due to Thorotrast may affect the hemopoietic stem cell level and hemopoietic microenvironment.","['Kamiyama, R', 'Ishikawa, Y', 'Hatakeyama, S', 'Mori, T', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Kamiyama R', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Hatakeyama S', 'Mori T', 'Sugiyama H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/chemically induced/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Contrast Media/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/pathology', 'Preleukemia/chemically induced/pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Thorium Dioxide/*adverse effects']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Apr;56(4):153-60. doi: 10.1007/BF00320745.,"['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['10.1007/BF00320745 [doi]'],,,,,
