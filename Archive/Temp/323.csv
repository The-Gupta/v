The mAb used (HH2, EBU.65, EBU.141 and OKB4) detect different epitopes of CDw75. Normal peripheral blood B cells expressed high levels of CDw75 detectable with HH2, EBU.65 and EBU.141 but did not react with OKB4. Cells from patients with B-cell CLL closely resembled normal B cells. All CDw75 epitopes, including OKB4, were strongly expressed on some Namalwa variant Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. The OKB4 epitope was also present on red cells from all normal donors. The other CDw75 mAb were unreactive with red cells from some normal donors. The CDw75 epitope detected with EBU.65 was present on most CD4+ T cells and on a minority of CD8+ cells. HH2 and EBU.141 stained only small numbers of T lymphocytes. OKB4 did not react with T cells. EBU.65+, CD4+ T cells had low levels of expression of CD45R0, CD29, CD54 and CD58, and had high levels of CD45RA antigen. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) activation of cells led to the loss of EBU.65 binding. These results suggest that the CDw75 epitope recognized by the EBU.65 mAb is a marker of native T lymphocytes. On B CLL cells the epitopes detected with HH2, EBU.65 and EBU.141 were destroyed by treatment with neuraminidase. Treatment of B-CLL cells and red cells with neuraminidase increased the binding of OKB4, suggesting that this epitope is masked by sialic acid. The results suggest that CDw75 is a sialylated cell-surface antigen expressed in a number of tissue-specific isoforms.",,PMC1384594,,,,,,,,,,

The determinant sialyl Lewis-x is found on both glycolipids as well as on glycoproteins. Using specific inhibitors of the biosynthesis of N-linked glycosylated glycoproteins, we investigated whether N-linked glycans or their modifications are involved in ELAM-1-dependent adhesion of HL60 cells to activated HUVEC. The inhibitors of glycoprotein processing N-methyl-deoxynojirimycin, 1-deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine did not affect ELAM-1-dependent adhesion.

On SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions urinary sCD23 showed two bands corresponding to molecular weights of 45-60 kD and 28-35 kD indicating that sCD23 may be excreted in combination with another molecule. When subjected to gel filtration in its native state, sCD23 from urine showed a major peak at approximately 150 kD and a minor peak (probably a breakdown product) at 21 kD. Urinary sCD23 was more strongly held by DEAE-cellulose and required 0.5 M buffer pH 8.0 for elution, suggesting that it is more anionic than sCD23 from culture supernates.

The role of this oncogene in differentiation and proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitors is presently undefined. To determine c-kit expression by normal hematopoietic progenitors, CD34+ cells were isolated from disease-free human bone marrow, and RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used to assess expression. By this method, we have demonstrated c-kit expression by CD34+ bone marrow progenitors. To address the functional requirement for c-kit expression in normal human hematopoiesis, CD34+ cells were incubated in the presence of sense, antisense, or missense oligonucleotides to c-kit, and subsequently cultured in the presence of either recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). Exposure of CD34+ cells to c-kit antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited colony-forming ability of cells cultured in the presence of rhIL-3, but had no effect on colony formation of cells cultured in rhGM-CSF.

Tyrosine kinase activity was found to increase throughout the period of induced maturation. The specificity of this increase in enzymatic activity for the differentiated state was demonstrated by the findings that (a) it was independent of the inducer used, and (b) the treatment of a differentiation-resistant subline of this murine leukemia with an inducer did not produce a significant elevation of tyrosine kinase activity. To determine whether tyrosine protein kinase activity was involved in the differentiation process itself or whether it was a product of the mature state, a series of experimental approaches was employed. Kinetic analyses showed that tyrosine protein kinase activity continued to increase beyond the peak in the level of differentiation. In addition, the total cellular protein phosphotyrosine content, measured by immunoblotting and flow cytometric analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, did not increase in accord with the elevation of tyrosine kinase activity. Increases in protein phosphotyrosine content, which were dependent upon the length of exposure to the inducing agent, were observed when cultured cells were treated with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Thus, the effect of the increasing tyrosine kinase activity in maturing cells appeared to be negated by competing protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. Finally, the inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity, genistein and PKI-23, did not interfere with the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. These findings support the concept that myeloid differentiation associated tyrosine protein kinase activity may not be involved in the initiation of the differentiation process itself. This conclusion deviates from previous assumptions, based on earlier work in this laboratory as well as in that of others, that the differentiation associated kinase activity has an essential role in the initiation of the maturation process. An attractive alternative speculation is that this activity may have a functional role in the mature myeloid cell.",,,,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In 13 out of 23 separations, populations of cells were obtained in which CD34+ cells constituted greater than 50% of the cells present. The best recovery and enrichment of the CD34+ cells was achieved when cells were obtained from patients in the accelerated phase of CML, when the cells were processed on the same day they were obtained from patients, and when adherence to soybean agglutinin flasks was used as a pre-enrichment step. In suspension culture, the CD34+ cells were capable of extensive proliferation and differentiation. In semi-solid culture, the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) directly correlated with CD34 positivity. The number of clonogenic cells/CD34+ cells was highest at the time of initial diagnosis of CML, fell during the chronic phase (CP) of the disease, and rose at the time of disease acceleration. This observation suggests that therapy during the CP of the disease produces a greater reduction in clonogenic cells than in the number of CD34+ cells.

Since none have been proven to be curative, it is important that all be considered, as individual patients might need to undergo a series of sequential treatments with each. In fact, some elderly patients with minimal splenomegaly and relatively normal blood counts might require no therapy. Splenectomy has a role in rapid reversal of severely depressed blood counts in association with a systemic infection; however, growth factors might soon replace this role of emergency splenectomy. Treatment with recombinant interferon results in few complete remissions, but with normalization of peripheral blood counts in over 80% of patients. In the original interferon alfa-2b study of 195 patients, only three of the 159 patients achieving a normalization of their blood counts have subsequently died. Treatment with deoxycoformycin either after interferon or initially has resulted in an apparent complete remission rate of approximately 60%, but recent follow-up analyses suggest that hairy cells persist within the bone marrow; however, patients seem to remain in a clinical remission.

To this end [5'-32P]5MedCMP was synthesized by a novel postlabeling procedure. At low substrate concentrations (less than 100 microM), the enzyme(s) present in crude HL-60 whole-cell extract deaminated 5MedCMP faster than they did dCMP. Although the phosphorylation of dCMP to dCDP was easily demonstrable with both kinds of cell extracts, no phosphorylation of 5MedCMP to 5MedCDP (5-methyldeoxycytidine 5'-diphosphate) was observed. This phenomenon was confirmed using HL-60 cells made permeable to nucleotides with Tween 80. In view of the substantial 5MeCyt (5-methylcytosine) content of DNA and the degradation of DNA that occurs in cells, it is conceivable that 5MedCyd (5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine) and 5MedCMP are available for reutilization in DNA synthesis. This would have devastating effects on cellular control and gene expression.

HTC.JZ1 cells were stimulated to secrete up to fourfold increased amounts of IL6 over 24 hours by treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Both functional IL6 levels, measured as hepatocyte stimulating factor (HSF) activity, and IL6 mRNA concentrations were increased proportionally by exposure to LPS. Similarly, IL6 mRNA was induced by LPS treatment in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The induction of Il6 mRNA by LPS was inhibited both in primary hepatocyte and hepatoma cell cultures by treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, consistent with the known analogous repression of the IL6 gene by dexamethasone in macrophages, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL6 secreted by HTC.JZ1 cells was utilized as an autocrine inducer of endogenous acute phase gene expression: HTC cells expressed constitutive levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) mRNA specified by the major rat acute phase gene, the alpha 2M gene, which is known to be regulated by IL6. By contrast, normal rat liver biopsy material and a number of other rat hepatoma cell lines lacked endogenous IL6 production and showed very low to zero expression of endogenous alpha 2M mRNA. Expression of alpha 2M mRNA in HTC.JZ1 cells was inducible by treatment with LPS. The constitutive and the LPS-induced production of alpha 2M mRNA were significantly reduced (up to 50% inhibition) by addition of an anti IL6 serum to the culture medium and removal of the immune complexes. However, complete neutralization of the alpha 2M-inducing HSF activity could not be obtained with anti-IL6 serum alone, probably because HTC.JZ1 cells secrete comparable quantities of a second HSF activity. This activity, the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), is also known to stimulate transcription of the rat alpha 2M gene but was not reactive with anti-IL6 sera. The induction of IL6 mRNA in HTC cells by LPS was regulated at the transcriptional level, as demonstrated by a series of mutagenesis and transfection experiments. Progressive deletion of 5' flanking sequences from the IL6 gene promoter region reduced the basal level, and the LPS-induced promoter activity after transfection into HTC.JZ1 hepatoma cells. IL6 has been shown to act as an autocrine regulator of growth for certain B lymphoid cell lines derived from human multiple myelomas. The results presented here establish that IL6 secreted by certain hepatoma cell lines also acts in an autocrine fashion to induce expression of the endogenous acute phase alpha 2M gene.",,,,"['AI22166/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI23351/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27493/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Growth factors also affect the sensitivity of AML blast cells to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). Others have reported that factor-treated cells are more ara-C sensitive than blasts in culture without factors. These authors have reported previously that AML blasts grown with rG-CSF, with or without GM-CSF, are more sensitive than cells in GM-CSF alone. This paper reports experiments which show that changes in the ara-C sensitivities of blast cells in different growth factors are not explained by changes in the percentage of cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase of the cycle. Blasts freshly obtained from five AML patients were cultured in either rG-CSF, rGM-CSF, or rIL-3; they were then exposed to 20 min pulses of either high specific activity tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) or a high concentration of ara-C. Regardless of the factor present, the pulse of 3HTdR decreased the number of clonogenic cells by about 50%, the result expected for actively proliferating cells with an S phase occupying about half the cycle time. The same result was found for four of the five blast cell populations grown in G-CSF and pulsed with ara-C; in contrast, clonogenic cells grown in GM-CSF or IL-3 from these four populations were not killed by ara-C. The blasts from the fifth patient were ara-C resistant under all conditions. It was concluded that exposure to GM-CSF or IL-3 decreased ara-C sensitivity in blasts that were actively making DNA. The observation was explored in more detail using a cell line (OCI/AML-1a) that is both ara-C sensitive and growth factor dependent. These studies showed that about 15 h of growth in factor are required for a change in ara-C sensitivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After their first induction chemotherapy, six out of eight AML patients showed a rapid increase of neutrophils, recovered from infections and achieved complete remission (CR). One patient, in whom both neutrophils and blasts had increased during rhG-CSF administration, achieved CR through the next administration of chemotherapy (CR rate 87.5%).

During rhG-CSF administration, an increase of blastic cells in peripheral blood was observed in four out of all 13 AML patients. One of three CML patients, with a lymphoid crisis, showed an increase only of neutrophils, and recovered from infection. The other two showed increases of both neutrophils and blasts. One patient with CML in blastic crisis, undergoing induction chemotherapy with rhG-CSF administration, returned to the chronic phase. These clinical experiences suggest rhG-CSF to be effective in supporting infection therapy and in possibly enhancing the sensitivity of myelogenous leukemic blasts to antileukemic agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A 13-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital on May 1988, and diagnosed as having ANLL M2 according to the FAB classification. During the induction and post-induction chemotherapy, 116 units of blood products were transfused to her as the supportive therapy until October 1988, when non-A non-B hepatitis developed. As the persistent liver dysfunction interfered with anti-leukemic chemotherapy on the protocol, allogeneic BMT from her HLA identical MLR nonreactive brother was done on July 1989. Preconditioning regimen consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and short term methotrexate. After the BMT, her liver dysfunction once improved; her serum amino-transferase levels were normal for about 3 months. Soon after discontinuation of cyclosporine A, however, her liver function deteriorated again. The examination of hepatitis C virus antibody in her sera, which had been harvested sequentially and stored at -40 degrees C, on November 1989 revealed that she had been already seropositive at the time of BMT. The BMT-induced immunologic changes may have influenced the natural course of hepatitis C virus infection in the patient.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activation of these two growth-related genes appears to involve the induced nuclear expression of DNA-binding proteins that specifically engage related kappa B enhancer elements present in the 5' regulatory regions of these genes. In human T cells, kappa B enhancer-binding activity has been discerned as an unexpectedly large family of UV cross-linked nucleoprotein adducts, termed p50, p55, p75, and p85. The protein components of each of these DNA-protein adducts have been shown to share structural similarity with the v-rel oncogene product. The p55 adduct is composed of the 50-kDa subunit of NF-kappa B derived from a 105-kDa precursor polypeptide, while the p50 adduct contains a smaller protein that is closely related to NF-kappa B p50. The p75 adduct contains the 65-kDa subunit of NF-kappa B, while the p85 adduct is composed of the human c-rel proto-oncogene product. We now demonstrate that HTLV-I Tax, in the absence of other viral pX gene products, is capable of inducing the nuclear expression of all four of these kappa B-binding proteins in human T cells, with most marked effects involving c-Rel and NF-kappa B p65. Tax induction of the nuclear expression of c-Rel and NF-kappa B p50 is regulated, at least in part, at a pretranslational level involving increases in c-rel and NF-kappa B p105 mRNA expression. To study the pattern of expression of these kappa B-specific proteins in cells infected with the whole HTLV-I, seven cloned HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines were established from the peripheral blood of patients with adult T-cell leukemia. Of note, only three of these seven cell lines produced Tax, and c-rel mRNA and nuclear protein expression was confined to these three cell lines. In contrast, NF-kappa B p50 and NF-kappa B p65 were constitutively expressed in the nuclei of all seven of the HTLV-I-infected cell lines, even in the absence of detectable Tax or other viral gene expression. These findings raise the possibility of an alternate, Tax-independent pathway for the induced nuclear expression of NF-kappa B p50 and NF-kappa B p65 following HTLV-I infection.",['10.1128/JVI.65.12.6892-6899.1991 [doi]'],PMC250789,,"['IK11AI00950-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM06337/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM07184/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Tax'],,,,,,,

The regulatory effect of ADF on the cytotoxic activity of TNF was examined by using a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, U937. When U937 cells were preincubated with recombinant ADF (rADF) (0.1-100 micrograms/ml) at 37 degrees C for 30 min, TNF-dependent cytotoxicity on U937 cells was markedly inhibited. This inhibitory effect was as high as 95% in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay (rADF 100 micrograms/ml) and 85% in the 51Cr-releasing assay (rADF 10 micrograms/ml). After pretreatment of U937 cells with IFN-gamma to augment the sensitivity to TNF, an inhibitory effect of rADF was also found. When U937 cells were washed after preincubation with rADF, resistance to TNF-dependent cytotoxicity was still observed, indicating that rADF inhibited the sensitivity of U937 to TNF-dependent cytotoxicity rather than modifying TNF molecules. Scatchard analysis of TNF receptors on U937 cells using 125I-TNF showed that rADF modulated neither the density nor the affinity of the cell membrane significantly. rADF also reduced the cytotoxicity induced by anti-Fas IgM mAb which shows cytotoxicity quite similar to TNF. rADF (10 micrograms/ml) reduced 90% of the cytotoxicity by anti-Fas IgM mAb, without a detectable change either in Fas Ag expression (MFI 58.1 vs 53.3) or in the degradation of anti-Fas IgM mAb as determined by flow cytometric analysis. These findings indicated that the rADF-induced resistance to the cytotoxic effect of TNF and anti-Fas mAb was not related to the modulation of the TNF receptor or Fas Ag.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The adherent cells are maintained in a serum-free tissue culture medium, and consist of a predominant population of CD10+ fibroblast-like cells and a minor population of CD10+/nonspecific esterase+ macrophages. Adherent cell cultures seeded with fresh or cryopreserved fetal bone marrow, or purified CD10+/surface IgM- cells, provide a supportive microenvironment for lymphoid cells with a predominant phenotype of CD10+/CD19+/HLA-DR+/surface IgM-. Supplementation of the adherent cell cultures with human IL-7 induces active growth of BCP during the first 14 to 21 days of culture. However, the expansion of these cells does not continue past 21 days, and the cultures undergo a steady decline in BCP. Analysis of adherent cell conditioned medium revealed the presence of an unidentified soluble factor (or factors) that acts in concert with IL-7 to promote the growth of CD10+/surface IgM- cells.

The qualitative and quantitative changes were comparable to those mediated by IL-6 or leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF). Like IL-6, IL-11 acted synergistically with IL-1 on type 1 acute phase proteins. The combination of IL-11 and dexamethasone yielded a magnitude of stimulation which was more similar to the combination of LIF and dexamethasone than IL-6 and dexamethasone. IL-11 elicited in treatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes a qualitative change of plasma protein production which was similar to that in H-35 cells. Comparison of rat and human hepatoma cells indicated that the IL-11 response did not correlate with that of IL-6 or LIF, suggesting that the action of IL-11 was mediated by an IL-11-specific receptor system. However, the intracellular transduction of the IL-11, IL-6, and LIF signals to the acute phase protein genes seems to rely, in part, on common elements as judged from their stimulatory effects on the transfected expression vector containing the IL-6 response element of the rat beta-fibrinogen gene.

Because this feature was not observed in H-2d/H-2d homozygotes or H-2d/H-2z heterozygotes, the high CD5+ B cell frequencies are apparently controlled by the homozygosity of a locus or cluster of loci closely linked to H-2z complex of NZW strain. As the CD5+ B cell frequencies in the peritoneal cavity did not differ among the H-2-congenic strains, the frequencies of these cells in the peritoneal cavity and in the spleen appear to be at least in part under separate control.

Washless staining of unfixed nuclei was found to be rapid and simple and resulted in greater precision of the DNA analysis and in less aggregation and loss of cells.",['10.1002/cyto.990120508 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Ricin intoxicates cells by binding through its B-chain to galactose-terminated oligosaccharides found on the surface of all eukaryotic cells and then transferring its A-chain to the cytosol where it disrupts protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes. In addition to binding, the B-chain plays an important, but not yet understood, role in the translocation of the A-chain through a cellular membrane to the cytosol. Blocking the two galactose-binding sites of native ricin by chemical modification with affinity ligands created an altered toxin, called blocked ricin, that has at least a 3500-fold lower binding affinity and is more than 1000-fold less cytotoxic than native ricin for Namalwa cells (a Burkitt's lymphoma line) but that has maintained the translocation function of the B-chain and the catalytic activity of the A-chain. Conjugation of blocked ricin to monoclonal antibodies that bind to cell surface antigens creates new cytotoxins that approach the potency of native ricin. These cytotoxins incorporate the three essential functions of natural toxins, i.e., binding to cells, transport through a membrane, and catalytic inactivation of an essential cellular process; but in addition they possess a defined cellular target specificity. Such potent immunotoxins may play an important therapeutic role in cancer treatment. Clinical trials with an anti-CD19-blocked ricin and an anti-CD33-blocked ricin conjugate against B-cell cancers and acute myeloblastic leukemia have begun.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic blasts constituted 83% of the peripheral white blood cells and more than 90% of the marrow nucleated cells. Cytoplasmic vacuoles were found in some leukemic cells. About half the leukemic cells showed a few azurophilic granules stained with Wright's stain, whereas exhibited a faint pinkish hue around the cells without cytoplasmic granules (water-soluble granules) by Riu's stain. The cytoplasmic granules failed to be stained with peroxidase but stained positively with toluidine blue. The former result could lead one to misclassify the case as lymphoid leukemia, but the characteristic finding of basophilic cells in Riu's stain should direct one to make the diagnosis of ANLL with basophilic differentiation. The cytochemical findings of this case suggested that basophilic differentiation should be considered when leukemic cells show peroxidase-negative granules. Riu's stain and toluidine blue stain are useful to make the correct diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the MEG-01s cells, iloprost/PGI2, or PGE1 stimulated cAMP production with ED50 values practically identical to the IC50 values for the [3H] iloprost binding. STA2 and U46619, TXA2/PGH2 agonists, PGE2/PGE1, iloprost/PGI2, and thrombin elevated the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), as determined by Fura-2 fluorescence signals. Elevation of [Ca2+]i by PGE2/PGE1 and iloprost, but not that by TX-agonists or thrombin, was totally dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. This effect by PGE2/PGE1 was partially inhibited by prior treatment of the cells with islet-activating protein (IAP), while that by TX-agonists or by PGI2/iloprost was not affected. We tentatively conclude from these results that: (1) MEG-01s cells express (a) PGI2/PGE1 receptor(s) coupled to adenylate cyclase and Ca2+ influx, a TXA2/PGH2 receptor coupled to the phosphatidylinositol-turnover-Ca2+ system, and the PGE2/PGE1 receptor coupled to Ca2+ influx; (2) the receptors for TXA2/PGH2 and iloprost and those for PGE2/PGE1 and thrombin are coupled to IAP-insensitive and IAP-sensitive GTP-binding proteins, respectively, and function in a different manner to elevate [Ca2+]i.

Clinically, retinoids have shown variable effectiveness in therapy and/or prevention of oncological diseases of skin, head and neck, lung, bladder, vulva and bone marrow. With a few exceptions, monotherapy with retinoids has not been satisfactory. Similarly, monotherapy with interferon alpha has been used successfully only for some specific indications. Retinoids have a marked differentiation-inducing effect which may contribute to their therapeutic effect. Experiments were carried out in transformed cell lines to test the combination of retinoids with interferon alpha and other cytokines on differentiation. In HL-60 cells, an acute promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, induction of differentiation was determined by induction of an oxidative burst potential. Retinoids showed the following order of activity: tretinoin greater than isotretinoin greater than acitretin. Cytokines had no differentiation-inducing effect by themselves. However, the addition of the following cytokines to retinoids potentiated the retinoid-induced differentiation: IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFN gamma, TNF alpha, G-CSF, IL-1 alpha and IL-4. In experiments with HL-60 or other cell lines, the pattern of differentiation-induction was always dependent on the particular retinoid/cytokine combination. IFN alpha provoked a marked potentiation of retinoid-induced differentiation. The combination of the antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effect of the retinoids together with the antiproliferative, immunostimulatory and differentiation-potentiating effects of IFN alpha suggests that this combination might be a particularly promising treatment for neoplastic diseases.",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08129.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of signal transduction through Fc epsilon RII/CD23 was dissected by transfection of cDNA coding for Fc epsilon RII to the YT human natural killer-like cell line, activation of which was easily detected by the induction of interleukin 2 receptor/p55(Tac). Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 with H107 anti-Fc epsilon RII monoclonal antibody markedly enhanced interleukin 2 receptor/p55 expression on the YT cells transfected with Fc epsilon RII cDNA (YTSER cells). Similar induction of interleukin 2 receptor/p55 by the cross-linking of Fc epsilon RII was observed on an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line, 3B6, and fresh leukemic cells isolated from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus Fc epsilon RII/CD23 provides activation signals not only in YTSER cells but also in activated B cells. A possible involvement of protein-tyrosine kinase in the Fc epsilon RII-mediated signal transduction was studied. Fc epsilon RII was physically associated with a src family tyrosine kinase p59fyn and not with p56lck, which was also found in YT cells. Recently it was reported that p59fyn was associated with T-cell antigen receptor.

To evaluate the latter hypothesis, various human cells of non-epithelial origin, including lung fibroblasts, U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells, K-562 erythroleukemia cells, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells as well as freshly isolated blood lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages were examined for CFTR gene expression. Although Northern analysis failed to show CFTR mRNA transcripts in these cells, amplification of mRNA (after conversion to cDNA) by polymerase chain reaction combined with Southern analysis demonstrated the presence of CFTR mRNA transcripts at low levels in all cells evaluated except HL-60 cells. Comparative quantitative analysis showed fibroblasts contained 200-400 fold less CFTR mRNA transcripts than the T84 and HT-29 colon carcinoma epithelial cell lines, but had similar levels of CFTR transcripts to those of other epithelial cell lines. Nuclear transcription run-on analyses demonstrated very low level CFTR gene transcription in fibroblasts and U-937 cells, similar to that of other epithelial cells, but lower than the T84 and HT-29 colon carcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, while chromatin DNA of fibroblasts had no DNase I hypersensitivity sites in the 5' flanking region of the CFTR gene, HT-29 chromatin DNA exhibited four DNase I accessible sites in the same region, suggesting that these sites may be related to more active transcription of the CFTR gene in the intestinal epithelial cells than in fibroblasts.",['10.1093/nar/19.19.5417 [doi]'],PMC328907,,,['CFTR'],,,,,,,

Several different aFGF mRNA species resulting from alternative splicing have been reported. These results suggest that the gene structure and regulatory mechanism for gene expression of aFGF are complex. As a first step toward understanding aFGF gene structure, we have isolated nine overlapping genomic DNA clones spanning 54 kbp and determined the complete DNA sequences of all three coding exons. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences between the human and bovine DNA showed that the sequence similarity extended 2400 bp downstream from the coding region. Cloning of the aFGF gene allowed us to characterize this locus in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients. A fraction of ANLL patients (10-20%) have a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5, whose distal breakpoint overlaps the aFGF locus. Therefore, a prospective cohort of eight ANLL patients was screened using three different repetitive sequence-free probes derived from the aFGF locus. Using beta-globin gene as a normalization probe for hybridizing band intensities, we conclude that there is no allelic loss or gross rearrangement within the 40 kbp stretch of the aFGF gene locus in ANLL patients with or without 5q- deletion. Consistent with this observation, the aFGF mRNA was not detected in the mononuclear cells derived from either an ANLL patient or a normal individual as judged by the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. We also identified a DNA fragment, 10.7 kbp upstream from the first coding exon of human aFGF, whose sequence is conserved in both the primate and rodent genomes.

We tested whether one molecular target for the cytostatic action of NO may be ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis. In a concentration-dependent manner, NO gas and lysates of activated macrophages that generated comparable amounts of NO led to the same degree of inhibition of partially purified RR from L1210 mouse lymphoma cells. Lysates from nonactivated macrophages, which do not produce NO, were noninhibitory. With lysates from activated macrophages, RR was protected by omitting L-arginine or by adding the NO synthase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium, N omega-methyl-L-arginine, or N omega-amino-L-arginine. L-Arginine, but not D-arginine, abolished the protective effect of N omega-amino-L-arginine. The prototypic pharmacologic inhibitor of RR is hydroxyurea. Its structural resemblance to N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine, a reaction intermediate of NO synthase, prompted us to test if hydroxyurea can generate NO. In the presence of H2O2 and CuSO4, hydroxyurea produced NO2-/NO3-, aerobic reaction products of NO. Addition of morpholine blocked NO2-/NO3- generation from hydroxyurea and led to formation of nitrosomorpholine, as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Thus, hydroxyurea can produce an NO-like, nitrosating rectant. L1210 cell DNA synthesis was inhibited completely by activated macrophages or by hydroxyurea, and was partially restored to the same degree in both settings by providing deoxyribonucleosides to bypass the block in RR. Thus, both NO gas and NO generated by activated macrophage lysates inhibit tumor cell RR. The RR inhibitor hydroxyurea can also generate an NO-like species. Similar, partial restoration of tumor cell DNA synthesis by deoxyribonucleosides in the presence of activated macrophages or hydroxyurea suggests that cytostasis by activated macrophages and by hydroxyurea has comparable mechanisms, including, but probably not limited to, inhibition of RR.",['10.1084/jem.174.4.761 [doi]'],PMC2118959,,['CA-43610/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

However, there is a drawback in that G-CSF may stimulate the proliferation of AML progenitors. To determine the parameter(s) indicative of responsiveness of AML blasts to G-CSF, various surface phenotypes of blasts were examined in relation to the blast colony formation stimulated by G-CSF in 39 AML patients. A correlation was found only with transferrin receptor positivity among the various phenotypes studied. The population mean of percentages of transferrin receptor-positive blasts in the group responding to G-CSF in vitro was significantly higher than that of blasts in the group not responding to G-CSF. A further correlation was found between transferrin receptor positivity and the number of G-CSF receptors on the blasts; that is, blasts expressing more G-CSF receptors have greater transferrin receptor positivity. In our previous study, we observed that blasts with a large number of G-CSF receptors produce more colonies in response to G-CSF. These results indicated that blasts expressing more transferrin receptors have a larger number of G-CSF receptors and may show more active proliferation in response to G-CSF. Therefore, the proliferative response of blasts to G-CSF can be predicted by examining transferrin receptor positivity. The clinical use of G-CSF in AML patients may be recommended when the patient's blasts have a low level of transferrin receptor expression. The measurement of transferrin receptors on blasts, instead of the rather complicated G-CSF receptor determination, would be a useful indicator for the safer application of G-CSF in AML patients.",['10.1002/jcp.1041480313 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These CSFs and interleukins by themselves stimulated the proliferation of leukemic blast progenitors without adding TGF-beta 1. G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 stimulated blast colony formation in nine patients, IL-6 stimulated it in five, and IL-1 beta stimulated in four. TGF-beta 1 significantly reduced blast colony formation stimulated by G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-6 in all patients. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 enhanced the stimulatory effect of IL-3 on blast progenitors from three cases, while in the other seven patients TGF-beta 1 reduced blast colony formation in the presence of IL-3. To study the mechanism by which TGF-beta 1 enhanced the stimulatory effect of IL-3 on blast progenitors, we carried out the following experiments in the three patients in which it occurred. First, the media conditioned by leukemic cells in the presence of TGF-beta 1 stimulated the growth of leukemic blast progenitors, but such effect was completely abolished by anti-IL-1 beta antibody. Second, the addition of IL-1 beta in the culture significantly enhanced the growth of blast progenitors stimulated with IL-3. Third, leukemic cells of the two patients studied were revealed to secrete IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) constitutively; the production by leukemic cells of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha was significantly promoted by TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, the growth enhancing effect of TGF-beta 1 in the presence of IL-3 was fully neutralized by anti-IL-1 beta antibody. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 stimulated the growth of blast progenitors through the production and secretion of IL-1 beta by leukemic cells.",['10.1002/jcp.1041480310 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation was assayed in liquid culture by [3H]thymidine uptake and in semisolid medium by colony formation.

Exposure of 5 x 10(5) cells/ml to 50 ng/ml MGF for 24 h, a time during which synergism is noted with MGF plus either GM-CSF or IL-3, did not change GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor binding affinity or the number of binding sites. Exposure of cells to MGF for 48 h did not alter subsequent GM-CSF- or IL-3-stimulated proliferation.

Comparison of the tcl-3 cDNA and its 5' genomic sequences with DNA sequences from the t(10;14) translocation breakpoints showed that this gene is structurally altered in four patients with t(10;14)(q24;q11) T-ALL.

It stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of cells of the neutrophil-granulocyte lineage and has been investigated as therapy for patients with various neutropenic conditions, both iatrogenic and disease related. rG-CSF is well tolerated, the most frequently reported adverse effect being mild to moderate bone pain. A major use for rG-CSF therapy will be in ameliorating the neutropenia which follows cytoreductive chemotherapy. rG-CSF accelerates neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy, leading to a reduction in duration of the neutropenic phase. Consequently, infection rate is diminished, as is the associated usage of antibiotics and duration of hospitalisation. The implications are that rG-CSF may allow increased dose intensity and stricter adherence to chemotherapy schedules. The increase in neutrophils produced by rG-CSF renders it a useful treatment for conditions such as congenital, acquired and cyclic neutropenias for which current therapy is not very successful. rG-CSF may be an effective therapy in myelodysplasia, although there is concern about acceleration of the possible rate of conversion of this disease to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is also likely that rG-CSF will be useful in accelerating the recovery of transplanted bone marrow in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma and solid tumour. Furthermore, there is great potential for expansion of the role of rG-CSF as monotherapy or in combination regimens with other cell factors in various haematological disorders such as aplastic anaemia. In summary, while many aspects of its use remain to be clarified, rG-CSF must be seen as an exciting advance in therapeutics. It should rapidly find an important place as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy, and also appears to have substantial potential in a number of other neutropenic conditions which are currently difficult to treat.",['10.2165/00003495-199142020-00009 [doi]'],,,,,,,122,,,,

Three patients were infants and six patients were older children. Six of them had a high leukocyte count and a mediastinal mass was found in three cases. All but one showed hepatosplenomegaly and/or lymphoadenopathy. In spite of intensive chemotherapy, most of them responded poorly. Cytochemical analysis of their leukemic cells revealed a low percentage of positivity for myeloperoxidase reactivity (less than 25%) in two cases and electron microscopic platelet peroxidase reactivity was found in one of three analyzed cases. Phenotypically, these cells all expressed CD7, and other T-lineage-associated, B-lineage-associated, and/or myeloid-associated antigens were also detected to some extent. In addition, three cases expressed CD41 and one case expressed CD56. The T-cell receptor (TCR) genes and immunoglobulin gene were in the germline configuration in seven cases. In three rearranged cases, two showed only the TCR-delta gene rearrangement, and one had both TCR-gamma and delta gene rearrangements.

Megakaryocytic differentiation was detected in two cases in culture without TPA. These results suggest that the cells from these cases arose from stem cells capable of both lymphoid and nonlymphoid differentiation. Although the cells were heterogeneous with regard to their potency of differentiation, they have similar clinical characteristics.

The CD10 cell surface enzyme is known to hydrolyze a variety of biologically active peptides including met-enkephalin, formyl-met-leu-phe (f-MLP), and substance P. These three CD10/NEP substrates induce the migration and aggregation of neutrophils, suggesting that each of the peptides can function as a mediator of neutrophil inflammatory responses. Recently, inhibition of CD10/NEP was found to reduce the concentration of metenkephalin needed to activate human and invertebrate granulocytes by several orders of magnitude. Herein we show that f-MLP and substance P induce rapid changes in neutrophil morphology, migration, and adhesion molecule expression, including upregulation of Mo1 (CD11b/CD18) and shedding of LAM-1 (also known as LECAM-1, Leu8, or TQ-1, the human homologue of murine gp100MEL14). Importantly, these coordinated changes are potentiated by inhibition of cell surface CD10/NEP enzymatic activity. Neutrophil cell surface CD10/NEP enzymatic activity is also shown to be regulated by the activation state of the cell during the time period in which the enzyme has its most pronounced effects.

Asialofetuin failed to bind to calcyclin, emphasizing the importance of sialic acids. Binding of fetuin was most effectively reduced by N-glycolylneuraminic acid within a panel of mostly negatively charged sugars. Bovine submaxillary mucin and the ganglioside GM1, but not asialo-GM1, proved more effective than neoglycoproteins, carrying negatively charged carbohydrate moieties. Extension of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid to its lactosyl derivative increased its inhibitory potency. Among charge-free carbohydrate residues, only N-acetylglucosamine, lactose, and mannose, but not fucose, melibiose, or N-acetylgalactosamine affected fetuin binding, substantiating the inherent selectivity. Chemical modification with group-specific reagents revealed that lysine and arginine residues appear to be involved in ligand binding that is optimal in the presence of Ca2+, but not Zn2+ and stable up to 1 m NaCl. Biotinylation of calcyclin by modification of carboxyl groups facilitated performance of solid-phase assays with calcyclin in solution, yielding similar results with (neo)glycoproteins in relation to assays with immobilized calcyclin, thereby excluding an impact of binding to nitrocellulose on calcyclin's specificity. Subcellular fractionation disclosed the presence of fetuin-binding activity in all fractions, the specific activity decreasing from the nuclear to the particulate cytoplasmic fraction and the cytoplasmic supernatant. Affinity-purified antibodies were employed to detect high levels of calcyclin expression in acute lymphoblastic, myelogenous, and monocytic leukemia cell lines, but not in myeloma or lymphoblastoid cells. In comparison, most cells were nearly devoid of an O-acetylsialic acid-specific protein that is more abundant in various tissue types than calcyclin.","['0003-9861(91)90453-P [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90453-p [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

A majority of the cells from peripheral blood coexpressed the antigens against MAbs CD11, CD13, and CD33 but did not express the antigens against CD1, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD41 and 42, and glycophorin A. Three out of the 12 cases expressed CD7 antigen. However, one of them showed no reaction with Tp40 MAb, whereas the others showed reaction with Leu9 and T55. The discrepancy of reactivities between Leu9 and Tp40 MAbs prompted us to study the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, which showed similar reactions against Leu9 and Tp40 MAbs. Leu9, OKT16, and T55 MAbs reacted strongly with HL60 cells, whereas Tp40 MAb, which reacted strongly with T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, showed no reaction. The reactivity of Leu9, OKT16, and T55 MAbs with HL-60 cells was completely inhibited after preincubation with aggregated human immunoglobulin G (AHIG), which clearly shows the existence of nonspecific binding between these 3 MAbs and HL-60 cells via Fc gamma R. On the basis of our experiments, we conclude that HL-60 cells bind nonspecifically with Leu9, OKT16, and T55 MAbs via FcRI, and this is suggestive that de novo AML cells probably behave in the same fashion. Hence, we recommend that the utilization of murine IgG2a and IgG3 MAbs should be avoided especially in cell surface analysis of myeloid leukemic cells.",['10.1002/ajh.2830380114 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that two cis-acting signals are required for efficient RNA processing in HTLV-I LTR: (i) a remote AAUAAA hexamer at a distance of 276 nucleotides upstream of the polyadenylation site, and (ii) the 20-nucleotide GU-rich sequence immediately downstream from the poly(A) site. It has been postulated that the folding of RNA into a secondary structure juxtaposes the AAUAAA sequence, in a noncontiguous manner, to within 14 nucleotides of the polyadenylation site. To test this hypothesis, we introduced deletions and point mutations within the U3 and R regions of the LTR. RNA 3'-end processing occurred efficiently at the authentic HTLV-I poly(A) site after deletion of the sequences predicted to form the secondary structure. Thus, the genetic analysis supports the hypothesis that folding of the HTLV-I RNA in the U3 and R regions juxtaposes the AAUAAA sequence and the poly(A) site to the correct functional distance. This unique arrangement of RNA-processing signals is also found in the related retroviruses HTLV-II and bovine leukemia virus.",['10.1128/JVI.65.10.5165-5173.1991 [doi]'],PMC248993,,,,,,,,,,

The specificity of this cross-reactivity was demonstrated by absorption using purified viral proteins, virus lysates and extracts of infected cells. The data strongly suggested that the cross-reacting epitope(s), referred to as CE, differs from those responsible for cross-reactions between the major gag proteins of HTLV-I, HTLV-II and STLV-I, and between those of BLV and HTLV-I reported previously. The prevalence of antibodies to CE was low, even amongst infected hosts with high titres to other epitopes present in the major gag proteins of the homologous viruses.

Saporin titration experiments revealed that BsAb increased the toxicity of saporin 435-fold for HSB-2 cells, reducing the IC50 for saporin alone from 0.1 mumol to 0.23 nmol when BsAb was included. The rate of protein synthesis inactivation brought about by BsAb-mediated toxin delivery to HSB-2 cells was very similar to that described for conventional immunotoxins (IT's) with a t10 (time taken for a one log inhibition of protein synthesis compared with controls) of 46 h obtained at a saporin concentration of 1 nmol and 226 h at 0.1 nmol. BsAb titration studies demonstrated a clear dose response effect of BsAb concentration on target cell protein synthesis inhibition and cell proliferation. The absolute specificity of toxin delivery was unequivocally demonstrated by a failure of BsAb to deliver an effective dose of saporin to the CD7- cell line HL60 and by the blocking of BsAb-mediated delivery of saporin to HSB-2 cells with an excess of F(ab)2 fragments of the anti-CD7 antibody, HB2. These studies have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this BsAb for delivering saporin to a T-ALL cell line utilising CD7 as the target molecule on the cell surface. BsAb's would therefore appear to offer a realistic alternative to IT's for toxin delivery to tumour cells and may even offer certain advantages over conventional IT's for clinical use.",['10.1038/bjc.1991.291 [doi]'],PMC1977495,,,,,,,,,,

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas corresponding to these immature B cells include mantle zone lymphoma (MZL), a primary follicle variant of MZL without reactive germinal centers, and diffuse intermediate lymphocytic (centrocytic) lymphoma. Diffuse intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma (DILL) is considered a late stage in the progression of MZL. Cytologically, these lymphomas usually resemble their normal cellular counterparts and consist predominantly of atypical small lymphoid cells with slightly-irregular and indented nuclei, moderately-coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Small lymphocytic, cerebriform and blastic variants have also been described. In smears and touch preparations, the neoplastic cells are usually prolymphocytes. Immunologically, the cells have features of virgin B cells, bearing pan-B cell antigens along with monoclonal surface IgM, with or without surface IgD, and CD5 (Leu 1) antigen, and lacking common acute lymphocytic leukemia associated (CALLA) antigen. Cytogenetically, the t(11;14)(q13;q32) has been associated with this group of lymphomas, and expression of the putative cellular oncogene bcl-1 (11q13) has been demonstrated in 30-50% of cases. Clinically, the patients have a median age of 60 years and usually present with advanced stage disease. Splenomegaly, often massive, is present in 80% of those with MZL. Patients with MZL have a significantly longer median survival (74-77 months) than those with DILL (30-33 months), and survival in both groups is significantly prolonged if a complete clinical remission is attained. Based on clinical studies, MZL should be considered a low grade lymphoma and DILL should be considered an intermediate grade lymphoma by Working Formulation criteria. The lymphomas of primary follicle/mantle zone origin are a distinct clinicopathologic entity biologically analogous to the follicular and diffuse lymphomas of germinal center origin, from which they should be distinguished in current and future classifications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Criteria for entry into the study included: no prior therapy, stage III-IV or stage II with bulky disease and/or B-symptoms, age below 65. 79 pts were evaluable for response. Almost all pts received six courses of chemotherapy, plus radiotherapy on bulky disease. 53 pts (67%) achieved complete remission (CR), 7 (9%) partial remission (PR), 4 (5%) were considered stable disease (SD) and 15 (19%) progression disease (PD) with 5 of them died early during treatment. The actuarial overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) are respectively 54% at 61 mos and 62% at 41 mos. The median follow-up from the end of therapy is 56 mos (range 40-68). Until now 20 pts (38%) relapsed on a median time of 8 mos (range 2-21) from CR. These data allowed to us to consider this regimen as effective as the third generation protocols also taking into account the multicenter basis of this study. With the aim to evaluate the impact of the third generation regimen on the outcome of these pts, a randomized study has been performed comparing ProMACE-MOPP with the third generation regimens MACOP-B. Therefore, from 1988 up to now, 206 pts with similar clinical and histological characteristics, have been enrolled in the two arms. No differences in terms of CR and DFS have been registered between the two treatments, with roughly the same toxicity. An analysis of prognostic factors in the larger series of pts treated with ProMACE-MOPP in the first and in the second study (167 pts) was performed. On these basis it seems reasonable that our next step would be to candidate these poor prognosis pts to a new therapeutic strategy which included the use of ABMT and/or PBSC transplantation as first line.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared two lines that express biologically active CD3 receptors but differ in their biochemical activation pathways during ligation of this receptor. Jurkat cells respond to anti-CD3 with Ca2+ mobilization, PKC activation, induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of newly characterized lymphoid microtubule associated protein-2 kinase (MAP-2K). MAP-2K itself is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation for activation. Although ligation of the CD3 receptor in HPB-ALL could stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of a 59- kDa substrate, there was no associated induction of [Ca2+]i flux, PKC, or MAP-2K activation. A specific PKC agonist, PMA, which bypasses the CD3 receptor, could, however, activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL cells. This implies that defective stimulation of PKC by the CD3 receptor is responsible for its failure to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL. The defect in PKC activation is likely distal to the CD3 receptor as A1F14- failed to activate MAP-2K in HPB-ALL but was effective in Jurkat cells. The stimulatory effect of PMA on MAP-2K activity in HPB-ALL was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of this kinase which implies that PKC may, in some way, regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP-2K. A candidate for this role is pp56lck which underwent posttranslational modification (seen as mobility change on SDS-PAGE) during anti-CD3 and PMA stimulation in Jurkat or PMA treatment in HPB-ALL. There was, in fact, exact coincidence between induction of PKC activity, posttranslational modification of lck and tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of MAP-2K. Lck kinase activity in an immune complex kinase assay was unchanged during PMA treatment. An alternative explanation is that modification of lck may alter its substrate profile. We therefore looked at the previously documented ability of PKC to dissociate lck from the CD4 receptor and found that PMA could reduce the stoichiometry of the lck interaction with CD4 in HPB-ALL and to a lesser extent in Jurkat cells. These results imply the existence of a kinase cascade that is initiated by PKC and, in the course of which, lck and MAP-2K may interact.",,,,"['AI 15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 41576/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Here, we have studied the alloreactivity of natural killer (NK) cells from PVG nude (RT1c) rats against a panel of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) incompatible hemic cells. Both lymphocytes and BMC from the AO (RT1u), DA (RT1a), BN (RT1n) as well as the MHC-congenic PVG-RT1u (RT1u) rat strains were efficiently killed in vitro, whereas cells from syngeneic PVG rats were spared. The structures recognized on lymphocytes and BMC were probably similar since the two cell populations inhibited each other in cross-competition experiments. A number of features aligned the alloreactive effector cells with NK cells and not T cells. (a) Only about 5% of the effector cells from nude spleens expressed the T cell antigens CD3, CD5 or T cell receptor (TcR) alpha/beta whereas greater than 50% of the cells expressed markers present on NK cells (CD2, CD8, OX52 and the rat NK cell-specific marker NKR-P1 recognized by the monoclonal antibody 3.2.3). (b) The alloreactive cells were granular since pretreatment of nude spleen cells with the lysosomotropic agent L-leucine methyl ester which eliminated LGL, simultaneously abolished the cytolysis of both allogeneic lymphocytes and YAC-1 tumor cells. (c) Nude spleen cells stimulated with human recombinant interleukin 2 for 1 week in vitro generated large granular proliferating cells which were CD3-, CD5-, TcR alpha/beta-, but greater than 95% 3.2.3+. These cells efficiently killed allogeneic hemic cells from the same rat strains as did freshly isolated effector cells. (d) The cytolysis of allogeneic hemic cells could effectively be inhibited with unlabelled NK-sensitive (YAC-1 and K-562), but not NK-resistant (Roser leukemia) tumor cells. Cross-competition studies showed that PVG nude NK cells discriminated between AO, BN and DA BMC, suggesting that different alloantigens were positively recognized by subsets of NK cells. The mode of inheritance of the allodeterminant specifically recognized on AO BMC was investigated in crosses and backcrosses between AO and BN or DA rats. A gene dosage effect was observed in that this determinant was expressed at a slightly reduced level in F1 hybrids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['10.1002/eji.1830210927 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The five Brazilian sequences clustered together and were about as different from each other (0.5-0.75% nucleotide difference) as were three previously reported Japanese sequences (0.7-0.95%). In contrast, sequences of Caribbean origin were less homogeneous (0.5-1.9% nucleotide differences within this group). The Romanian sequence was not significantly more divergent than any of the others and was closest to our two Caribbean sequences. We observed two changes in a region (aa 176-209) which has previously been shown to contain a linear antibody epitope recognized by most human sera from seropositive individuals. One of these changes affects the binding of monoclonal antibodies to this epitope demonstrating the variability of an antibody epitope in the HTLV-I envelope.",['10.1016/0042-6822(91)90418-b [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The line grows slowly without stimulation but responds to interleukin-3 (IL-3), GM-CSF and mast cell growth factor (MGF), a ligand for the receptor encoded by the c-kit oncogene. When OCI/AML-4 cells are exposed to MGF with IL-3 or GM-CSF, additive or synergistic effects are seen. Combinations of MGF and G-CSF, IL-6 or CSF-1 give less growth than MGF alone. OCI/AML-4 cells are sensitive to retinoic acid; a dose related decrease in clonogenic cells is observed when OCI/AML-4 cells are exposed to retinoic acid in suspension culture. OCI/AML-4 cells are sensitive to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), but the ara-C dose-response curve can be changed by altering the regulatory milieu in suspension culture. The cells are more ara-C sensitive in MGF or G-CSF than in IL-3 or GM-CSF. Following a 24 h exposure to retinoic acid, the ara-C sensitivity increases; in contrast, after a similar exposure to hydrocortisone, the cells become less ara-C sensitive. These changes in ara-C sensitivity occur in cells that are actively making DNA, as indicated by the reduction in colony formation after exposure to tritiated thymidine. Since OCI/AML-4 cells respond to many of the regulators that affect the growth of freshly obtained AML blast cells, it is proposed that this cell line may be useful for the study of regulation on AML in general and the interaction between different regulators in particular.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of primitive progenitor cells (blast colony-forming cells, Bl-CFC) in the blood of patients with CML is reflected by their reduced capacity to bind to marrow derived stromal layers in vitro. Whereas normal bone marrow Bl-CFC bind irreversibly to cultured stromal layers (and none are found in normal blood), the Bl-CFC in CML bind transiently and then detach. The normal cell adhesion mechanism is partially sensitive to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Pl-PLC), indicating the participation of a phosphatidylinositol (Pl)-linked structure; however, when CML cells were treated with Pl-PLC it had no effect on progenitor binding. Two other Pl-linked structures, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and lymphocyte function associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) were normally expressed on CD34 positive CML cells and normally susceptible to Pl-PLC treatment. The treatment of normal cells with Pl-PLC, to mimic the situation in CML, resulted in the indiscriminate and inefficient binding of Bl-CFC to stroma. Moreover, treatment of the normal cells with 5637 conditioned medium (CM), which contains haemopoietic growth factors, also reduced the binding capacity of normal Bl-CFC; 5637CM treatment did not alter the expression of DAF. It is proposed that a Pl-linked cell adhesion molecule (CAM) is deficient in CML as a consequence of the constitutive activation of ABL kinase whilst, in normal cells, CAMs attached in this manner are responsible for efficient adhesion to stroma and are regulated by growth factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases (n = 7) with the cytogenetic abnormality t(8;21)(q22;q22) belonged to this group of IL-5 responders. Of the additional two cases, one had an apparently normal karyotype, but the other expressed a dicentric chromosome 21, an abnormality also involving the breakpoint region 21q22. The leukemic cells of the IL-5 responsive patients could also be stimulated to proliferate by IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF, and in some cases by IL-6 or M-CSF. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed the presence of the immature hematopoietic cell antigen CD34, the myelomonocytic maturation antigens CD13 and CD33, in association with the B-cell related surface marker CD19 on the leukemic cells. Immunoglobulin mu and T-cell receptor beta-genes in the leukemic cells were in germline configuration.

Using a variety of MoAbs against CRIs we investigated the distribution and topographic localization of CRI-positive B cells in normal adult human lymphoid tissues.

CRI-positive B cells are homogeneously distributed throughout all lymphoid tissues, accounting for 10% to 15% of all B lymphocytes, with the exception of the thymus, in which they represent the predominant B cell population. Immunophenotypic studies showed (1) that a small subpopulation (3.7% +/- 0.8%) of CRI-positive B cells are activated in vivo, based on CD25 and CD38 antigen expression; and (2) that approximately 50% of CRI-positive B cells express the 67-Kd pan-T-lymphocyte CD5 antigen, suggesting that the CRI-positive B-cell subset and the recently described CD5-positive B-cell subset are closely related.

Interferon alfa is approved for hairy-cell leukemia, condyloma acuminatum, Kaposi's sarcoma in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-A, non-B (type C) viral hepatitis. Interferon gamma has properties distinctive from those of IFNs alpha and beta and is approved as an immunomodulatory treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. Promising clinical results with IFNs have also been reported for basal cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, early human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, and laryngeal papillomatosis. Future clinical uses of IFNs may emphasize combination therapy with other cytokines, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hyperthermia, or hormones.",['10.1001/jama.266.10.1375 [doi]'],,['JAMA. 1992 Jan 22-29;267(4):508-9.

The first signal is delivered by the cytokine IL-4. The second signal activates B cells and is delivered by T cells, EBV infection, or engagement of the B cell-specific Ag CD40. Hydrocortisone (HC) has recently been shown to synergize with IL-4 to induce IgE synthesis in CD5+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. We show herein that a combination of HC and rIL-4 induces IgE synthesis in highly purified normal peripheral blood B cells. HC and IL-4 acted directly on B cells, because T cells and monocytes were not required for IgE synthesis. IgE induction was shown to occur in surface IgE- B cells isolated by cell sorting. These results suggest that IgE synthesis results from isotype switching, rather than from expansion of a precommitted B cell population. Furthermore, IgE synthesis was induced in sorted CD5- B cells, indicating that the ability to produce IgE in response to HC and IL-4 is not constrained by CD5 expression. Endogenous IL-6 was critical for induction of IgE synthesis by HC and IL-4, because an anti-IL-6 antibody strongly inhibited IgE production. These data suggest that hormones may play an important role in the regulation of IgE synthesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in the production of these immunotoxins, of possible clinical relevance, has been raised by the availability of 2 MAbs of high specificity for circulating monocytes and M5b ANLL, thus envisaging their potential use in bone-marrow purging. SAP emitoxin was selected on the basis of the low cytotoxicity in unconjugated form, as opposed to highly specific cytotoxicity and favourable pharmacokinetical properties in the conjugated form. SPDP conjugation produced immunotoxins which retained serological specificity and protein-synthesis-inhibitory activity. The 2 immunotoxins did not interfere with bone-marrow progenitor-cell growth in a CFU-GM colony assay. On the contrary, they were capable of killing monocytic cells selectively, as demonstrated in phenotypical and functional assays. Thus these 2 novel immunotoxins appear to be promising reagents in purging autologous bone marrow prior to transplantation in patients suffering from monocytic leukaemia.",['10.1002/ijc.2910490228 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Serial monitoring showed blockage of the myeloma cell proliferation in the bone marrow (from 4.5% to 0% myeloma cells in the S-phase in vivo) as well as reduction in the serum calcium, serum monoclonal IgG, and the serum C-reactive protein levels. The serum calcium and serum monoclonal IgG corrected by approximately 30%, whereas the C-reactive protein corrected to undetectable levels during treatment. No major side effects developed, although both platelet and circulating neutrophil counts decreased during anti-IL-6 therapy. A transient immunization was detected 15 days after the initiation of the treatment, which could explain the recovery of myeloma cell proliferation after 2 months of treatment (2% myeloma cells in the S phase).

Administration of rhG-CSF elicited striking rises in both leucocyte and neutrophil counts in the majority of the patients irrespective of the FAB subtypes of MDS. The rises in neutrophil counts were dose dependent and 5 micrograms/kg/d of rhG-CSF yielded approximately an 8-fold increase in neutrophil counts. Leucocytes and neutrophil counts started to increase shortly after the first injection of 5 micrograms/kg, was maintained at significantly elevated levels during 14 d of treatment, and returned to the pretreatment levels within several days following discontinuation of rhG-CSF. The action of rhG-CSF was specific for neutrophils since leucocytosis was due exclusively to neutrophilic increase associated with an increased marrow myeloid maturation. There were no consistent changes in the monocyte, eosinophil, lymphocyte, platelet or reticulocyte counts. After treatment, the percentage of marrow blast cells was reduced in eight of 13 evaluable patients with refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t). No patients developed acute leukaemia during the treatment or in the immediate follow-up period. The treatment was well tolerated with only minimal toxicity.

These studies showed that distinct NKa phenotypic profiles were restricted to cases with rearranged TCR configurations and that clonal CD3+NKa+ components could be predicted in most cases by assessing relationships between membrane CD16 and CD56 expression. For all normal NKa subpopulations, there was a high correlation (P less than 0.0001; n = 31) between the expression of these two membrane determinants. Markedly increased CD16 expression by CD3+NKa+ cells, in relation to CD56 (i.e. a high CD16:CD56 ratio), was found exclusively in cases with rearranged TCR (13/16 cases); 2/3 of the remaining cases showing significantly reduced CD16:CD56 ratios and high (greater than 2.0) CD3+CD56+ absolute numbers.

The cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF, also known as leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF) induces cultured rat sympathetic neurons to become cholinergic, without affecting their survival or growth. To understand the role of this factor in normal development, it is essential to determine where it is produced in situ. To localize CDF/LIF mRNA, a semiquantitative, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method was employed. Actin and tubulin mRNA were used as internal controls, and two different sets of CDF/LIF primers were compared. In postnatal rat peripheral tissues, CDF/LIF mRNA was selectively localized in the target area of developing, sympathetic cholinergic neurons; the mRNA was not detected in the targets of sympathetic noradrenergic neurons. This finding supports the hypothesis that CDF/LIF is a target-derived neuronal differentiation factor. In postnatal rat brain, CDF/LIF mRNA is localized selectively in two parts of the visual system, visual cortex and superior colliculus. Thus, CDF/LIF may play a role in this system as well.",['10.1073/pnas.88.16.7298 [doi]'],PMC52282,,,,,,,,,,

A measurable decrease (30%) in the specific activities of crude preparations of PR-17 cell protein kinase C was observed when the enzyme was measured with histone as the phosphate acceptor substrate, but other aspects of the protein kinase C phenotype (intracellular concentrations and binding affinities of phorbol diester receptors, translocation of activated enzyme from cytosolic to particulate subcellular fractions, relative expression of the alpha and beta isozyme proteins) were equivalent in both PMA-resistant PR-17 cells and in wild-type HL-60 cells. Direct analysis of the behavior of the alpha and beta isozymes after the exposure of each cell type to 100 nM PMA for 12 h revealed that the activities and intracellular concentrations of both isozymes were downregulated to an equivalent extent in both wild-type and PMA-resistant cells. These results suggest that the cellular basis for the resistance to the effects of PMA was present ""down-stream"" from the activation and down-regulation of protein kinase C and was perhaps a nuclear component. Among the genes which were likely to be differentially regulated when each of the two cell lines were treated with PMA were those for the protein kinase C isozymes themselves. In wild-type HL-60 cells, the intracellular concentrations of type HL-60 cells, the intracellular concentrations of mRNA for each of the beta isozymes were increased (up to 5-fold) 48 h after the initiation of PMA treatment; further studies indicate that an activator of protein kinase C could influence the expression of HL-60 cell protein kinase C genes in an isozyme-specific manner. Comparable PMA-induced alterations in mRNA levels were not observed in PMA-resistant cells, even under conditions of significant activation and subsequent down-regulation of protein kinase C protein. Taken together, these data suggest that activation and down-regulation of the isozymes of protein kinase C may not represent absolute determinants of the PMA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, but that specific alterations in the levels of the mRNA for the beta isozymes of protein kinase C, or of other genes which may be regulated by the activated kinase isozymes, are important to the induction of leukemia cell differentiation by PMA.",['S0021-9258(18)98596-0 [pii]'],,,"['CA-44589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA-09560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/M13977', 'GENBANK/M18254', 'GENBANK/M18255', 'GENBANK/M22199', 'GENBANK/M63255', 'GENBANK/M63926', 'GENBANK/M63977', 'GENBANK/M63978', 'GENBANK/S47390', 'GENBANK/S47394']",,,,,

Therefore, we have studied the effect of different chemotherapeutic regimens on the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or acute leukemias. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated with an aggressive protocol (COL-BLAM) and in leukemia patients (TAD-9) fibrinopeptide A, prothrombin fragment (F1 + 2) and thrombin antithrombin III complexes (TAT) increased (Tables 4 and 6), while D-dimer did not deviate significantly. The ratio D-dimer/TAT consequently showed a significant decrease, indicating increased formation of thrombin after release of procoagulant factors, which is not paralleled by an activation of fibrinolysis. Both these groups were also characterized by an increase in uric acid and in C-reactive protein and plasminogen-activator inhibitor, two acute-phase reactants. In contrast, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas treated with a less aggressive protocol (COP) showed no significant changes in hemostatic variables, uric acid, or acute-phase reactants. The release of procoagulant factors relates to the cytostatic sensitivity of the tumor and to a high tumor-cell destruction.

Anti-DAF evoked similar but less complement (C) deposition and cytolysis while anti-MCP alone did not, although it enhanced the anti-DAF-mediated C deposition and cytolysis. Thus, once the C3 step is overcome, U-937 is attacked by the late components leading to cytolysis because of the absence of p18. On the other hand, HL60 allowed the deposition of C3 by blocking of either DAF or MCP followed by the Mg(2+)-EGTA-serum treatment. C5, C8 and C9 were subsequently deposited but resulted in no lysis. Lysis of 60% was attained by the additional blocking of p18. Thus, HL60 is poorly protected by C3 and C9 step regulation. Strikingly, extensive C3 deposition occurs on p39 without any antibody treatment, suggestive of the presence of unique alternative pathway activators. However, little cytolysis was induced on p39 even by blocking of all three inhibitors with antibodies. These results suggest that in activation of the alternative pathway on myeloid cells, C3 step is controlled by the inhibitors and alternative pathway activators, and C-mediated cytolysis is blocked by p18 and additional regulatory mechanisms or factors which assist in protection of nucleated host cells from MAC attack. Susceptibility to homologous C of these cell lines, therefore, reflects relatively low potency of C regulation on their membrane.",['10.1002/eji.1830210802 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings were as follows: 1. Most cells displayed a localized calcium rise in response to micropipet aspiration. This represented an average threefold increase as compared to resting level, and it was observed during the first 10 s following aspiration. A slow return to initial level occurred within about 3 min. Further, this calcium rise involved a mobilization of intracellular stores, since it was not prevented by adding a calcium chelator into the extracellular medium. 2. All micropipet-aspirated cells displayed a local accumulation of microfilaments, with a preferential localization in the cell protrusions or near the pipet tips. 3. No absolute correlation was found between the localization of calcium rise and cytoskeletal accumulation. 4. Cell deformability was decreased when intracellular calcium was maintained at a constant (high or low) level with ionomycin and/or EGTA.

The degree of increase in the LTD50 (50% lethal tumor dose) is expressed numerically, as a quantitative index designed to compare degrees of transplantation resistance to tumor cell challenge. A LTD50 was achieved by an intradermal (i.d.) immunization with xenogenized tumor cells when challenged with tumor cells implanted intraperitoneally 2 weeks after the immunization: this LTD50 value was 527,000 times higher than that of the non-immunized group. When we combined this type of immunization with appropriate doses of bleomycin (BLM) or cyclophosphamide (CY), which are able to augment antitumor immunity, the LTD50 was 723,000-1,190,000 times higher than that of the non-immunized group. This increase in the LTD50 is definitely higher than that achieved by a single immunization with irradiated tumor cells (x 33,000) and combined with either BLM (x 93,000) or CY (x 140,000). We also studied the therapeutic effect of a tumor cell vaccine combined with antitumor drugs BLM or CY in tumor-bearing rats. We observed a synergistic effect caused by BLM or CY after i.d. immunization with xenogenized tumor cells: this showed a significant increase when compared with the therapeutic effects obtained by chemotherapy alone (P less than 0.01).

Alkaline elution was used to study 3 types of DNA lesions. When L1210 cells were incubated with thioTEPA alone, or with thioTEPA in the presence of microsomes and NADPH, no single-strand breaks were detected. However, incubation of L1210 cells for 2 h with thioTEPA, at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 microM, caused a dose-dependent increase in interstrand cross-linking that reached a maximum by 2 h after drug exposure. In the presence of rat hepatic microsomes and NADPH, this cross-linking was eliminated, but a different DNA lesion, alkali-labile sites, was produced. These alkali-labile sites were partially reparable with maximum repair achieved by 2 h after removal of drug. ThioTEPA was greater than 85% consumed by the microsomal incubation conditions employed, and TEPA was the only product of the microsomal metabolism of thioTEPA. Alkaline elution studies of L1210 cells that had been incubated with TEPA, alone or in the presence of microsomes and NADPH, demonstrated an elution pattern identical to that produced by thioTEPA in the presence of microsomes and NADPH. Lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with Fanconi's anemia were far more sensitive to thioTEPA and mechlorethamine hydrochloride than were lymphoblasts derived from normal humans, but this hypersensitivity was not noted with TEPA or bleomycin. This is consistent with the known hypersensitivity of cells from patients with Fanconi's anemia to agents that produce interstrand cross-links and with the alkaline elution studies described above. In contrast, lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia were no more sensitive to thioTEPA than were lymphoblasts derived from normal humans but were far more sensitive to bleomycin. One of these cell lines proved hypersensitive to TEPA, whereas the other was no more sensitive to TEPA than were lymphoblasts from normal humans. Our data imply that thioTEPA produces interstrand cross-links but that TEPA, the primary metabolite of thioTEPA, produces DNA lesions that are alkali labile.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, using purified recombinant cytokines and homogenous cell populations, we provide evidence for a synergistic or additive effect of IFN-gamma with recombinant human (rhu) hematopoietic growth factors in the stimulation of clonogenic blasts from most AML patients examined. Under conditions of limiting cell concentration, rhuIFN-gamma alone showed little effect on blast proliferation, whereas in conjunction with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhuIL-3), IFN-gamma significantly enhanced colony formation in 13 of 15 AML cases. Maximal stimulation was obtained at low concentrations of IFN-gamma (2 to 20 pmol/L) in four cases and at higher concentrations (700 to 7,000 pmol/L) in the remainder. IFN-gamma also synergized with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) in 9 of 13 cases. Within 1 hour of exposure, IFN-gamma induced a twofold to fourfold accumulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-specific transcripts in AML blasts and several AML cell lines that include HL-60 and OCI-AML 1. Further, the synergy between IFN-gamma and IL-3 on AML blasts was partially or completely abrogated by a TNF alpha neutralizing antibody, suggesting that growth enhancement by IFN-gamma may be mediated through TNF alpha production in AML blast culture. Exposure of normal precursors (burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E] and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM]) to IFN-gamma also resulted in significant growth enhancement, suggesting that the proliferative response elicited by IFN-gamma was not limited to AML blasts. Finally, in M07-E, an IL-3-dependent human ""megakaryoblastic"" cell line, IFN-gamma also significantly enhanced IL-3-supported colony formation, much in the same way as in primary AML blasts. In contrast, IFN-gamma inhibited growth of all CSF-independent leukemic cell lines tested. This inhibition was partially alleviated by anti-TNF alpha antibody. In summary, our data indicate that IFN-gamma can enhance or antagonize cell proliferation, depending on the cell type. Further, TNF alpha appears to mediate the biologic effect of IFN-gamma either in growth stimulation or growth inhibition.",['S0006-4971(20)84151-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Significant protection from ferrate-mediated inactivation is observed in the presence of template-primer but not in the presence of substrate deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Furthermore, ferrate-treated enzyme loses template-primer binding activity as judged by UV-mediated cross-linking of radiolabeled DNA.

Children were treated according to modified BFM protocols. 25 patients were before, 5 during and one after puberty (2 to 16 y.). Before treatment, during induction therapy, during cranial irradiation, 4-6 weeks later and during maintenance therapy the following hormone values were estimated: TSH and prolactin basal and 30 min. after TRH (5 micrograms/kg i.v.), LH and FSH basal. Final investigations included total T4 and T3. In conclusion, chemo- und radiotherapy lead to transient elevations of TSH and prolactin in a few patients, but without proof for permanent disorders. Due to the fact all 3 patients with hyperprolactinaemia showed high prolactin levels (700 to 770 mU/l) already before treatment it is unlikely therapy was the main cause of these observed alterations. Although basal LH and FSH values were in normal ranges for age the increasing values after cranial irradiation in prepubertal children may reflect a possible initiation of early maturation, reported by others. Furthermore a retrospective growth study was performed in children treated with 2 different protocols. Protocol LSA2L2 used in the past before 1981 resulted in a permanent reduction of the height. In contrast, the mean SDS for height in children treated with protocol VII declined only during the intensive period of treatment. A catch-up growth occured already during maintenance therapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation with 18 Gy in our patients under protocol LSA2L2 did not affect growth during the first 5 years after diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They often had distinct nuclear clefts. These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells. They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-cell phenotype. CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells. The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage. The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells.

The release of histamine from circulating cells such as basophils and tissue mast cells has been implicated in hypotensive reactions since the effects can be prevented by antihistamine pretreatment. The direct effects of vancomycin on histamine release were therefore investigated in rat peritoneal mast cells and rat leukemic basophils (RBL-1 cells). Suspension cultures of mast cells or RBL-1 cells were exposed to vancomycin for 30-60 minutes at concentrations comparable to those infused clinically (2.28 or 4.56 mg/ml). Vancomycin induced a time- and dose-dependent release of histamine into the culture media from both cell types. The reference degranulating agent, Compound 48/80 (CP 48/80), was also shown to induce histamine release from mast cells and RBL-1 cells. Mast cells were significantly more sensitive to vancomycin and CP 48/80 than RBL-1 cells and, unlike RBL-1 cells, were responsive to the inhibitory effects of cromolyn sodium on histamine release. Cromolyn sodium did not inhibit vancomycin-induced histamine release in RBL-1 or mast cells. Morphologically, mast cells exposed to either vancomycin or CP 48/80 exhibited dose-related degranulation. On the other hand, treatment-related degranulation effects of either vancomycin or CP 48/80 on RBL-1 cells could not be reliably distinguished from controls by qualitative evaluation. Based upon these findings it is concluded that mast cells may represent a more useful model to evaluate the potential of investigational agents to release histamine and to study mechanisms of histamine release than RBL-1 cells.",['10.1007/BF01980877 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes 4 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 of myelodysplasia occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin. The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of etoposide-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt leukaemia was 336 (95% CI 92-861). No leukaemias were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The increased risk of leukaemia was most probably due to etoposide alone or in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of leukaemias among patients with germ-cell tumours treated with only cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The risk of leukaemia was dose related since all 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no leukaemias were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004). 3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22.

The gene has been cloned, but little is known concerning regulation of expression of the gene. Our study showed that fibroblasts from a variety of tissues (lung, bone marrow, gingiva, foreskin) constitutively expressed D-factor RNA. Levels of expression of this gene increased in fibroblasts of each of the tissues after exposure to several stimuli including products of activated macrophages and lymphocytes (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 and lymphotoxin). Other stimuli were those capable of activating either protein kinase C (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and teleocidin), G-binding proteins (NaF) or those inhibiting protein synthesis (cycloheximide). Accumulation of D-factor RNA by TNF may in part be explained by stabilization of D-factor transcripts; TPA and cycloheximide clearly stabilized D-factor transcripts. We and others have shown that these same signals similarly stimulated fibroblasts to express RNAs coding for a variety of cytokines including three colony-stimulating factors as well as interleukins 1 and 6. Taken together, D-factor probably is a participant in the cascade of cytokines that are produced in mesenchymal cells after various stimuli such as bacterial invasion.",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90054-w [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines. This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5. It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a glycolipid named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and stained PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of galactose. When its binding to isolated glycolipids was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other glycolipids including CTH.

To investigate the etiology of the thymic abnormalities and of the lymphomas, the development of lymphoid organs in transgenic mice was studied. The thymus of these mice goes through three unusual successive events: perturbation of thymic development during embryogenesis, disappearance of thymocytes between day 14 and day 21 after birth, and subsequent proliferation of large blast-like cells. These events are associated with the abolishment of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta lineage of the T cell differentiation, leading to preponderance of cells belonging to the TCR gamma delta L3T4-Lyt-2- double negative (DN) lineage. Bone marrow transplantation and thymic graft experiments demonstrate that the abnormality resides in the bone marrow stem cells rather than in the thymic environment. The expression of TL antigen in the transgenic mice is greatly increased and TL is expressed in a wide range of T cells, including normally TL- DN cells and L3T4+ Lyt-2- and L3T4-Lyt-2+ single positive cells. These quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in TL expression most likely cause the abnormal T cell differentiation. The gamma delta DN cells migrate into peripheral lymphoid organs and constitute nearly 50% of peripheral T cells. Immune function of the transgenic mice is severely impaired, as T cell function is defective in antibody production to sheep red blood cells, in mixed lymphocyte culture reaction to allogenic spleen cells and also in stimulation with concanavalin A. These results indicate that the gamma delta cells are incapable of participating in these reactions. Molecular and serological analysis of T cell lymphomas reveal that they belong to the gamma delta lineage, suggesting that the gamma delta DN cells in this strain are susceptible to leukemic transformation. Based on cell surface phenotype and TCR expression of the DN thymocytes and T cell lymphomas, a map of the sequential steps involved in the differentiation of gamma delta DN cells is proposed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['10.1084/jem.174.2.351 [doi]'],PMC2118907,,,['Tla-3'],,,,,,,

This study has revealed that the enzyme is secreted by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and by H35 hepatoma cells. H35 cells have lower cellular levels of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase than do hepatocytes but secrete a greater proportion of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase. More than 99% of the total enzyme from H35 cells accumulated in the medium after 48 h. The cells were shown to remain intact during the secretion period since lactate dehydrogenase, dihydrofolate reductase, and lysosomal hydrolases other than gamma-glutamyl hydrolase were retained within the cell. Using the substrate 4-amino-10-methyl-pteroyldiglutamate (4-NH2-10-CH3-Pte-Glu2), the intracellular and secreted enzyme form(s) from H35 cells were found to have the following properties (a) Km values of 24.3 +/- 3.7 microM and 34.8 +/- 8.6 microM, respectively, and (b) maximal activity at pH 5 to 7 and apparent molecular weights of 120,000 by gel filtration. Both the cellular and secreted enzymes convert 4-NH2-10-CH3-PteGlu4 and pteroylpentaglutamate acid, to the corresponding monoglutamates with little or no appearance of intermediate chain length polyglutamates. This suggests that both act primarily as endopeptidases. Thus far, the cellular and secreted enzymes cannot be differentiated although the current studies do not establish this point unequivocally. Alterations in the cellular and secreted H35 cell gamma-glutamyl hydrolase levels in response to changes in culture conditions revealed that glutamine enhances activity while insulin diminishes it. Other transformed cells found to secrete this protein are Hep-G2 human hepatoma, JAR human choriocarcinoma, HeLa, and rat glioma. gamma-Glutamyl hydrolase could not be detected in medium conditioned by human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and relatively low activities were found in the medium from CCRF-CEM or K562 leukemia cells. These studies directly establish for the first time the secretion of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase in vitro.",,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The first model substrate contained sequences from the HIV genome and was designed to be structurally similar to the DNA-extended tRNA created by initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis during retroviral replication. The DNA-extended RNA was a template and was annealed to a DNA oligonucleotide that primed reverse transcription of the RNA in the template. The second model substrate was structurally similar the first substrate but contained sequences unrelated to the HIV viral genome. The RT-RNase H catalyzed excision of the RNA from the template of the two model substrates was examined. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus RT-RNase H hydrolyzed the substrates to leave a single ribonucleotide 5'-phosphate at the 5'-terminus of the model DNA genome. In contrast, avian myeloblastosis virus RT-RNase H hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond at the DNA-RNA junction. These hydrolytic specificities were not highly dependent on substrate sequence. The importance of these specificities to retroviral integration is discussed.

Cross resistance between Ara-C and Aza-dC was revealed by the lack of antileukaemic activity in five patients with with Ara-C resistant leukaemia. Combination therapy with Aza-dC/Ams-acrine induced a considerable period of a granulocytopenia (28-35 days), while the toxic effect on erythro- and megakaryopoiesis was comparable to that reported for high dose Ara-C/Amsacrine chemotherapy. Remarkable is the long disappearance time for leukaemic blast cells in bone marrow, i.e. 3-5 weeks in some cases. Analysis of cell membrane markers showed a loss of the early differentiation antigens CD34 and CD33 from leukaemic bone marrow cells after 7 days of Aza-dC treatment, which is suggestive of leukaemic cell differentiation. In the small group of patients tested for DNA hypomethylation no association existed between the degree of hypomethylation and clinical response.

The mutant genomes were all replication defective.

Plus-strand strong-stop DNA was not detected. These results suggest that RNase H normally promotes strong-stop translocation, perhaps by exposing single-stranded DNA sequences for base pairing. Four new DNA species were also detected among the reaction products. Analysis of these DNAs suggested that they were minus-strand DNAs formed from VL30 RNAs encoded by the mouse genome.

Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival.",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.8.1409 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Serotonin release induced by HRA-N and anti-IgE was inhibited by 78 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively (IC50 7.5 x 10(-7)M) by hydrocortisone (10(-5)M). HRA-N does not cause arachidonic acid metabolism, however, anti-IgE induced the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene (LT)C4, and the generation of both mediators was inhibited by 10(-5)M hydrocortisone (IC50 = 4.8 x 10(-7)M, and 3.6 x 10(-9)M, respectively). Inhibition required at least 5 to 6 h of hydrocortisone exposure and was maximal after 22 h. The observed effects of hydrocortisone could be reproduced by human recombinant lipocortin-I (5 x 10(-7)M). Hydrocortisone, 10(-5)M, was a less potent inhibitor of calcium ionophore A23187-mediated serotonin release and PGD2 and LTC4 generation (inhibition of 20 +/- 2, 17 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 10%, respectively). Inasmuch as A23187-induced stimulation is not dependent on receptor coupling, the enhanced ability of hydrocortisone to inhibit IgE- and HRA-N-mediated events as compared with A23187 suggests that one possible site of action of hydrocortisone may be interruption of receptor-effector signals. In the presence of arachidonic acid, hydrocortisone-treated cells released as much LTB4 and PGD2 as control cells, however, serotonin release and LTC4 generation were inhibited 50 and 55%, respectively. Thus, these data suggest that hydrocortisone has three possible sites of action: 1) inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, 2) inhibition of glutathione-s-transferase, and 3) inhibition of serotonin release by a third mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this process, a primer is elongated on one template and then switches to other templates for additional elongation until it is much longer than the templates on which it was made. Models of retrovirus replication require the RT to catalyze two distinct strand transfers. Additionally, they propose that the RT ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity is involved in both transfers. RTs from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian myeloblastosis virus, and murine leukemia virus differ in molecular mass and subunit composition. However, they all catalyzed strand transfer synthesis on (rA)300, generating characteristically long products. An RNase H-deficient enzyme, HIV-RTRD, catalyzed strand transfer synthesis to the same degree as native HIV-RT, indicating that a functional RNase H activity is not required. Additionally, N-ethylmaleimide, which inhibits RNase H but not polymerase activity of HIV-RT, did not diminish strand transfer synthesis. Highly processive DNA synthesis by each RT was found to be required for the strand transfer reaction. RNase H- murine leukemic virus RT has a structural modification that not only eradicates RNase H, but also makes the polymerase much less processive for DNA synthesis. However, conditions that allow this modified enzyme to bind repeatedly to the same primer during synthesis, i.e. conditions that simulate higher processivity, allow strand transfer synthesis. Catalysis of strand transfer synthesis is not a property of all DNA polymerases, since the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I is unable to catalyze this reaction even if high processivity is simulated. These results suggest that strand transfer synthesis relies on an unidentified functional activity present in RTs.",['S0021-9258(18)98810-1 [pii]'],,,"['AI 27054/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The expression of lck in human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed T-cell lines is closely associated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) dependence for their growth. That is, IL-2-dependent HTLV-I-transformed cell lines contain the lck message abundantly as HTLV-I-negative T-cell lines, whereas IL-2-independent HTLV-I-transformed cell lines express either no or little lck mRNA, although they are derived from T-cells. The lck gene contains 2 distinct promoters which direct 2 types of lck transcript with different 5' untranslated regions. In this study, we show that HTLV-I-transformed IL-2-dependent T-cell lines contain the upstream promoter-initiated lck transcript exclusively, in contrast to HTLV-I-negative transformed T-cell lines which express the down-stream promoter- as well as the upstream promoter-initiated lck transcript. In addition, lck mRNA disappears transiently in IL-2-dependent HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines after stimulation for T-cell activation, which is also observed in peripheral blood T lymphocytes. These results indicate that the disappearance of lck mRNA in HTLV-I-transformed, IL-2-independent cell lines is caused by a mechanism which down-regulates the upstream promoter-initiated lck transcript and this IL-2-independent state may represent a further ""activated"" condition of the IL-2-dependent state by the stimulation which mediates T-cell activation.",['10.1002/ijc.2910480526 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This progress has resulted from the development of innovative approaches to treatment as well as a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the commonly used antileukaemic agents. Intrathecal therapy, via the intralumbar or intraventricular route, is a form of regional therapy that results in the delivery of very high drug concentrations to the principle target tumour site (the meninges) using a relatively small drug dose, thereby minimising both systemic drug exposure and systemic toxicity. The dosage and schedules, clinical pharmacology and toxicities of the commonly used intrathecal agents, methotrexate and cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside; Ara-C) are discussed in detail. Another approach which has been used to overcome the poor penetration of antileukaemic drugs into the CNS has been the use of high-dose systemic therapy. This strategy has been successfully applied in the treatment of meningeal leukaemia using both high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine. The clinical pharmacology, toxicities, and potential limitations of this approach are outlined.

However, more detailed characterization of CD34+ cells has been hampered by lack of anti-CD34 MoAbs that can be labelled directly with fluorochromes to facilitate subpopulation analysis by multi-parameter flow cytometry. We have recently isolated a murine anti-CD34 MoAb, designated as 8G12, that can be directly labelled with fluorochromes such as FITC. In this study, we have exploited this property of 8G12 to compare the reactivity of 8G12 and My10 with normal and leukaemic human marrow cells and to characterize normal early human B cell precursors by two- and three-colour immunofluorescence analysis. Comparison of three-colour staining profiles of normal bone marrow cells incubated with both 8G12 and MY10, and either anti-CD10 or anti-CD19 MoAb revealed the reactivity patterns of 8G12 and MY10 to be indistinguishable. This conclusion was confirmed by a similar comparative analysis of 8G12 and MY10 staining of blood and bone marrow cells from 4 patients with B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Of interest, both 8G12 and MY10 detected a CD34+CD10+CD19- population in normal adult bone marrow. To determine whether a CD34+CD10+CD19- precursor population previously reported by others to exist in fetal liver could also be identified, CD10+CD16- marrow cells were first isolated by FACS and the sorted cells then re-analysed for expression of CD19 and CD34. These studies showed that all of the sorted CD10+ cells that expressed CD34 appeared to coexpress CD19. No CD34+CD10+CD19- cells were detected (at a sensitivity of less than or equal to 0.1%). Further studies will be required to determine whether a very minor population of CD34+CD10+CD19- cells may still be generated in the normal development of B cells in adult human marrow.",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1991.tb05699.x [doi]'],PMC1535701,,,,,,,,,,

In the mouse c-kit maps to the W locus, which is known to be of central importance in hematopoiesis. Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) YB5.B8, which was raised against peripheral blood blast cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), was recently shown to bind to the extracellular domain of the c-kit product. This antibody does not bind detectably to normal peripheral blood cells and identifies a sub-group of AML patients with poor prognosis. We have used MoAb YB5.B8 to study the expression of c-kit by normal human bone marrow cells by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, and to isolate multipotential and erythroid colony-forming cells. In a series of 11 normal adult bone marrow specimens, MoAb YB5.B8 bound to 4.0% +/- 1.8% of the cells in the low-density fraction. Dual-labeling experiments were performed with YB5.B8, and CD33, CD34, and CD10 MoAbs. Three populations of cells binding YB5.B8 could be identified based on their pattern of coexpression of the other markers; ie, YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33-, YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33+ and YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33+. These populations had distinctive two-dimensional light scatter characteristics and are likely to correspond to precursor colony-forming cells, colony-forming cells, and maturing mast cells, respectively. No cells binding both YB5.B8 and an MoAb to the early lymphoid marker CD10 were found, implying that most early lymphoid cells do not express c-kit. MoAbs to the c-kit protein should prove valuable in multimarker studies of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Twenty-one cases were CD34-positive (CD34+) (greater than 15% of blasts) and the remaining 19 were CD34-negative (CD34-) (less than 3% of blasts). IL-4 alone (100 U/ml) could stimulate either DNA synthesis (with greater than 2.0 stimulation index) or leukemic blast colony formation in 24 of 40 AML patients. In the presence of other growth factors, IL-4 showed divergent effects on IL-3-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-, or erythropoietin-dependent colony formation. These effects of IL-4 were observed in both CD34+ and CD34- AML cases. IL-6 (100 U/mL) alone could not stimulate DNA synthesis and blast colony formation except for one CD34+ case. On the other hand, IL-6 showed synergistic effects on IL-3- and IL-4-dependent blast colony formation in 10 of 12 and 7 of 9 CD34+ AML cases, respectively. Among CD34- AML cases, such synergism was seen only in 1 of 12 cases for IL-3-dependent colony formation and in 3 of 7 cases for IL-4-dependent colony formation. The divergent effect of IL-4 and the synergistic effect of IL-6 were also observed in purified CD34+ leukemic blast populations, indicating that these phenomena are not mediated by accessory cells. The present study suggests that IL-4, alone or in combination with other growth factors, has divergent effects on the growth of AML progenitors irrespective of the CD34 expression, and that IL-6 acts synergistically with IL-3 or IL-4 on the growth of leukemic progenitors preferentially in CD34+ AML.",['S0006-4971(20)82996-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Primary epidermal cell cultures from newborn K1 transgenic mice containing a 12-kilobase human K1 genomic fragment were established in order to examine the expression of both human and mouse K1 in the presence of known modulators of epidermal differentiation. Elevated levels of Ca2+ in the culture medium induced both mouse K1 and human K1. Supplementing the medium with retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or introducing a Harvey viral ras oncogene (v-rasHa) into the cells completely suppressed mouse K1 but not human K1. Our results suggest that: (a) the human 12-kilobase insert contains all the necessary cis-acting elements to respond to the Ca2+ signal, and (b) other cis-acting elements, not present within this insert, may function independently to regulate the response of K1 to retinoids, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and v-rasHa transformation.

In the absence of added stimuli, HILDA/LIF mRNA was barely detectable in monocytes. HILDA/LIF mRNA accumulation was weakly induced by stimuli such as LPS or phorbol ester alone, and in a synergistic manner when they were used in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis in U937 cells did not detect an increase of HILDA/LIF gene transcription upon phorbol ester and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulation. Posttranscriptional control of HILDLA/LIF mRNA levels by an increase in mRNA half-life was demonstrated in the synergy between phorbol ester and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and in the superinduction of HILDA/LIF transcript accumulation when CHX was added to stimulated cells shortly before cell harvesting. HILDA/LIF mRNA expression was largely inhibited when U937 cells were treated with CHX either at the onset or 4 h after the beginning of the stimulation period. When CHX was added 2 h before cell harvesting, a superinduction of mRNA accumulation was obtained. G-CSF mRNA accumulation showed a different pattern of response to the same stimuli, in particular a higher rate of response to LPS. In contrast to HILDA/LIF, an augmentation of G-CSF gene transcription was detected in activated monocytic cells when compared to controls. These studies indicate that HILDA/LIF gene expression by phorbol ester- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated human monocytes has a relatively specific regulation, as compared to G-CSF gene expression, and that it is largely dependent on posttranscriptional mechanisms probably acting through labile, newly synthesized proteins.",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb17219.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These CD1 antigens appear similar to murine T1 and Qa molecules in terms of structure and tissue distribution, although the question of inter-species homology is controversial. A further group of alloantigens expressed predominantly on T cells has been reported however, with immunogenetic characteristics more closely analogous to the murine T1/Qa system than the CD1 antigens, although their precise identity remains ill-defined. Having previously shown that malignant B cells may express membrane CD1c, we examined leukaemic B-cells corresponding to early lymphoblastic differentiation (null- and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) through to the terminal plasma cell stage for the expression of other non-HLA class I beta 2m-associated molecules. It was found that leukaemic B-cells at intermediate/late stages of differentiation, represented by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and 'hairy-cell' leukaemia (HCL), had significantly higher beta 2m:HLA-ABC ratios than did the cells from other types of B-cell malignancy. Although leukaemic B cells with a demonstrable non HLA-ABC-associated beta 2m component expressed detectable levels of CD1c, and insignificant levels of CD1a and CD1b, the antigen density was insufficient to account for the excess beta 2m. In vitro stimulation of leukaemic B cells by phorbol ester substantially increased the expression of HLA-ABC and CD1c, but also accentuated further the difference between the expression of these molecules and that of beta 2m. There was no detectable beta 2m other than that associated with HLA-ABC and CD1 on the surface of malignant T cells by contrast. Our findings strongly support the existence, at certain stages of leukaemic B-cell differentiation, of an additional beta 2m component(s) other than that associated with HLA-ABC and CD1.",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1991.tb01520.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed expression of the four human HOX loci in erythroleukemic, promyelocytic, and monocytic cell lines to investigate whether the physical organization of human HOX genes reflects a regulatory hierarchy involved in the differentiation process of hematopoietic cells. Our results demonstrate that cells representing various stages of hematopoietic differentiation display differential patterns of HOX gene expression and that HOX genes are coordinately switched on or off in blocks that may include entire loci. The entire HOX4 locus is silent in all lines analyzed and almost all the HOX2 genes are active in erythroleukemic cells and turned off in myeloid-restricted cells. Our observations provide information about the regulation of HOX genes and suggest that the coordinate regulation of these genes may play an important role in lineage determination during early steps of hematopoiesis.",['10.1073/pnas.88.14.6348 [doi]'],PMC52080,,,"['Hox1', 'Hox2', 'Hox3', 'Hox4']",,,,,,,

In contrast, rapamycin and 506BD, which share common structural elements with FK506, by themselves have no effect on IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis. Both compounds, however, prevent inhibition by FK506 but not by CsA. Affinity chromatography with FK506, CsA, and rapamycin matrices indicates that the same set of immunophilins present in RBL-2H3 cells have been found in Jurkat T cells and calf thymus; however, the relative amounts of these proteins differ in the two cell types.

Chronic exposure of human Burkitt lymphoma and mouse M1 myeloblastic cell lines to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), reduced by more than 90% the PKC protein levels and enzymatic activity in cell extracts. The depletion of PKC from cells abrogated the ability of IFN (alpha + beta) to arrest cell growth at the G0/G1 resting phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, other responses to IFN such as the induction of (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase gene, continued to take place at the same dose response pattern thus excluding the possibility that early targets in the pathway, such as the number or affinity of IFN cell surface receptors might be affected by PMA. The same prolonged treatment of M1 cells with PMA did not interfere with the ability of another cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), to induce the normal type of G0/G1 arrest further supporting the specificity of the effect towards IFN responses. Unexpectedly, depletion of PKC from cells did not interfere with the negative effects of IFN on c-myc mRNA and protein expression in spite of the direct involvement of this molecular event in growth responses to IFN. The putative PKC dependent molecular event could therefore function either downstream to or in combination with the reduction in c-myc protein levels, providing a necessary but not a sufficient step to arrest cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 3 studies for adult AML (BHAC-DMP, BHAC-DMP (II) and M-85) at Nagoya University Hospitals from 1979 to 1987, intensive induction resulted in higher cure rate, and the reduction of the blasts in bone marrow at 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy to less than 20% was the most important prognostic factor to predict the long CR. However, it seemed impractical to give very intensive chemotherapy during the induction because of high frequency of complications due to prolonged myelosuppression. Thus, consolidation should be as intensive as possible. In M-85 protocol, the predicted 5-years survival and disease-free survival (DFS) of CR cases are 70 and 53% respectively. The result of JALSG-AML 87 study seems to confirm the above result. As for the indication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the first CR for adult AML, only a prospective randomized study will answer this important question. In case that DFS of chemotherapy will exceed 40 to 45%, it seems be wise to give chemotherapy first, and then BMT when the leukemia relapse.

In another six patients, rIL-4 enhanced blast colony growth in four patients or did not show any significant effect with any CSF in two patients. In suspension cultures of 12 cases studied, the effects of rIL-4 on the clonogenic cell recoveries were essentially similar to the results of the blast colony assay in each case. In three patients, rIL-4 augmented the differentiation of the leukaemic cells to monocyte lineage. Further, the clinical outcome was significantly different between the patients whose blast progenitors were stimulated by rIL-4 and the patients whose blast progenitors were suppressed by rIL-4 (P less than 0.05); three out of four patients in the former group failed in achieving complete remission (CR), while 12 out of 14 patients in the latter group achieved CR.

NADPH, the substrate of the respiratory burst oxidase, was found to be necessary not only for the increased O2 consumption, but also for tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of NADPH was not due to reduction of vanadate to vanadyl. Instead, NADPH was required for the synthesis of superoxide, which triggered the formation of peroxovanadyl [V(4+)-OO] and vanadyl hydroperoxide [V(4+)-OOH]. One or both of these species, rather than vanadate itself, appears to be responsible for phosphotyrosine accumulation and activation of the respiratory burst. Accordingly, the stimulatory effects of vanadate and NADPH were abrogated by superoxide dismutase. Moreover, phosphorylation was activated in the absence of NADPH by treatment with V(4+)-OO and/or V(4+)-OOH, generated by treatment of orthovanadate with KO2 or H2O2 respectively. The main source of the superoxide involved in the formation of V(4+)-OO and V(4+)-OOH is the NADPH oxidase. This was shown by the inhibitory effects of diphenylene iodonium and by the failure of undifferentiated cells, which lack oxidase activity, to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation when treated with vanadate and NADPH. By contrast, exogenously generated V(4+)-OO induced marked phosphorylation in the undifferentiated cells, demonstrating the presence of the appropriate tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. A good correlation was found to exist between induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the respiratory burst, suggesting a causal relationship. Therefore an amplification cycle appears to exist in cells treated with vanadate, whereby trace amounts of superoxide initiate the formation of V(4+)-OO and/or V(4+)-OOH. These peroxides promote phosphotyrosine formation, most likely by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Accumulation of critical tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins then initiates a respiratory burst, with abundant production of superoxide. The newly formed superoxide catalyses the formation of additional V(4+)-OO and/or V(4+)-OOH, thereby magnifying the response. Since vanadium derivatives are ubiquitous in animal tissues, V(4+)-OO and/or V(4+)-OOH could be formed in vivo by reduced O2 metabolites, becoming potential endogenous tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Because of their potency, peroxides of vanadate may be useful as probes for the study of protein phosphotyrosine turnover.",['10.1042/bj2760611 [doi]'],PMC1151049,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of this property was modulated by changes in the culture conditions, as revealed by binding studies with cells, derived from growth in medium containing different serum concentrations. These findings indicate that cell surface sugar receptors of tumor cells warrant further attention with respect to recognitive interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two RBL-2H3-derived cell lines with stable expression of murine Thy-1.2 antigen, after transfection of a genomic clone of murine Thy-1.2 or Thy-1.2 cDNA under the control of simian virus 40 promoter, were also analyzed. Direct radioantibody binding assays, indirect immunofluorescence studies and flow cytometry analyses revealed that both endogenous Thy-1.1 and transfected murine Thy-1.2 gene products were expressed on the surface of the cells under study. Analysis of the distribution of the Thy-1 antigen in situ in cells grown attached to tissue culture vessels located the Thy-1 predominantly in regions of cell-cell contacts. Incubation of RBL-2H3 cells with Thy-1.1-specific antibodies, or of the transfected cells with both Thy-1.1- and Thy-1.2-specific antibodies, induced a rapid early increase in the concentration of intracellular free calcium [( Ca2+]i) released from internal stores. Sustained increase of [Ca2+]i required the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium. The increase in [Ca2+]i was followed by histamine release from the target cells.

HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cell lysates and membrane fractions tagged with [35S]-methionine or phosphorus 32 showed no significant differences in their protein patterns as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by autoradiography. HL-60/S cells labeled with NaB[3H4] yielded glycoproteins that were smeared predominantly in the molecular-weight range of 210,000 and 160,000 Da, with pI values ranging between pH 4 and pH 4.4. In contrast, NaB[3H4]-labeled HL-60/AR cells showed 7-8 discrete glycoproteins within a molecular-weight range of 170,000 and 140,000 Da, with pI values also ranging between pH 4 and pH 4.4. In addition, [3H]-glucosamine incorporation into HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cells revealed that the latter showed lower uptake of [3H]-glucosamine than did the former. Following treatment with tunicamycin, [3H]-glucosamine uptake in HL-60/S cells decreased, whereas that in HL-60/AR cells remained unchanged. Surface-membrane radioiodination of HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cells showed two distinct protein electrophoretic patterns, with differences being observed in both the high-(220-95 kDa) and low-molecular-weight ranges (21 kDa). Flow cytometric analysis of HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cells using myeloid and lymphoid antigen-specific antibodies demonstrated no antigenic differences between HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cells. HL-60/S cells incubated in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, or the protein kinase C agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) developed a glycoprotein pattern similar to that observed in HL-60/AR cells. In addition, tunicamycin treatment of HL-60/S cells decreased daunorubicin (DNR) retention and altered its intracellular distribution as compared with that in HL-60/AR cells. These data indicate that HL-60/AR cells do not possess either de novo or amplified high-molecular-weight surface-membrane proteins; instead, existing proteins are hypoglycosylated. These results also show that HL-60/AR cells exhibit the multidrug-resistant phenotype in association with altered membrane glycoproteins of both high (220-95 kDa) and low molecular weight (21 kDa), but without overexpression of the P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, in HL-60/S cells, the multidrug-resistant phenotype is partially inducible by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of cell-surface proteins.",['10.1007/BF00689695 [doi]'],,,"['CA-31761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40 188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The metabolic pathways were also addressed, using purified mammalian enzymes and crude tissue extracts. Selenomethionine was found to be effectively metabolized to S-adenosylmethionine analog, and that analog was further metabolized in transmethylation reactions and in polyamine synthesis, similarly to the corresponding sulphur metabolites of methionine. Selenomethionine did not block these pathways, nor was there a specific block on the synthesis of DNA, RNA, or proteins when added to the culture medium. Selenomethionine showed cytotoxicity at above 40 microM levels. Yet, low selenomethionine levels (10 microM) could replace methionine and support cell growth in the absence of methionine. Selenomethionine toxicity took place concomitantly with changes in S-adenosylmethionine pools. D-form was less cytotoxic than L-form. Methionine concentration modified the cytotoxicity.

Accordingly, preclinical tests were undertaken of cisplatin and ara-C in combination. At the same time, a phase I/II clinical trial of the combination was conducted, using AML patients refractory to treatment or in relapse. In the laboratory, blasts from eight AML patients were tested against each agent singly and in combination. The observed survival values for the mixture were compared with those predicted by assuming either an additive effect or a more general effect that allows synergism or antagonism.

C-kit has been mapped to the W locus in the mouse, and the gene encoding the ligand has been shown to be the product of the murine SI locus. Previous genetic studies have shown that the murine W and SI loci play important roles in the normal function of hemopoietic stem cells. As these stem cells have been identified as the origins of abnormal clones in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), a study was begun of c-kit in AML. By Northern blot analysis, it was shown that all of 21 blast populations from AML patients were kit expression positive, but some AML cell lines did not transcribe detectable c-kit mRNA. This study is now extended to the responses of freshly obtained AML cells and cell lines to the ligand, mast-cell growth factor (MGF). In culture, fresh cells usually responded to added ligand with increases in both self-renewal and terminal divisions. The most obvious effects were seen when MGF was combined with either IL-3 or G-CSF. The response of cell lines to MGF mirrored their expression of c-kit; expression positive lines responded in culture with patterns similar to those seen for fresh cells. C-kit expression negative cells did not respond to MGF. RNA prepared from the cells giving rise to one such line, OCI/AML-5, was available for study. mRNA for c-kit could not be detected in this RNA sample by Northern blot analysis or the polymerase chain reaction. Thus the heterogeneity found in AML blast populations extends to the involvement of c-kit and its ligand in growth regulation, although blast populations without this regulatory apparatus appear to be rare.",,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,

In contrast to normal FAB-L2 or FAB-L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), these leukemias did not express cytoplasmatic and membranous immunoglobulin. The combination of translocation t(14;18) and additional chromosomal events on the other chromosome 14 account for the lack of immunoglobulin expression. In one case a low grade follicular lymphoma was found next to a high grade Burkitt type ALL. The translocation t(14;18) takes place as a mistake in the VDJH joining in pre-B cells in the bone marrow.

It was demonstrated that the conjugate with 25% oxidized Dex T10 as intermediate carrier linked more DNR molecules than the others. The degree of its substitution was 10-11 moles of DNR per mole of AHTG. Moreover, because the amount to reducing agent sodium borohydride (NaBH4), required for the reduction reaction, was relatively small, its damaging effect on AHTG and DNR was lessened accordingly. The antitumor effect of AHTG:Dex:DNR in vitro was tested by using 24-h cytotoxicity assay, with CEM as target cell. Cytotoxic effect of the conjugate was proven and the LD50 was 10.68 micrograms/ml. However, it showed only slight cytotoxic effect on non-target cell K562. When 10 min cytotoxicity assay was performed to show the specific tumor-killing effect of the conjugate, it revealed an obvious cytotoxic activity toward CEM, with the LD50 being 14.79 micrograms/ml, but hardly toward K562.

TL antigens have been thought to be expressed only on the surface of some T lineage cells, namely immature thymocytes of some mouse strains (TL+ strains), some leukemia cells, and activated T cells. While the function of TL antigens is unknown, recent studies have implicated the products of at least some TL region class I genes as molecules that present antigens to gamma/delta T cells. Since some gamma/delta T cells are known to be specifically associated with certain epithelial tissues, we have investigated the expression of some TL region class I genes in a variety of epithelium-containing tissues. Our results show that the TL antigen gene of C57BL/6 mice, T3b, and the TL antigen genes of BALB/c mice, T3d (previously T3c) and T18d (previously T13c), are highly expressed in the epithelium of the small intestine. In the case of T3b, we further show, using a T3 product-specific antibody, that its product is expressed on the surface of the columnar epithelial cells. In addition, we demonstrated that two other TL region class I genes of C57BL/6 origin, T9b and T21b, are also expressed nearly exclusively in intestinal epithelial cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the products of these TL region class I genes are recognized by gamma/delta T cell receptors of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, a subset of gamma/delta T cells that is localized in the intestinal epithelium and has a restricted V gamma repertoire. Finally, our study indicates that the relative levels of expression of the two homologous TL antigen genes, T3d and T18d, differ widely between the thymus and the intestine.",['10.1084/jem.174.1.213 [doi]'],PMC2118879,,,,,,,,,,

Double fluorescence analysis revealed that 20-40% of thymic CD16+ cells coexpressed CD1, while approximately half were cyCD3+. When cultured in the presence of peripheral blood lymphocytes and H9 leukemia cell line as a source of irradiated feeder cells and interleukin 2 (IL-2), CD3-4- thymocytes underwent extensive proliferation. In addition, after 1-2 wk of culture, 30-50% of these cells were found to express CD16 surface antigen. Cloning under limiting dilution conditions of either CD3-4- or CD3-4-16- thymocytes in the presence of irradiated H9 cells resulted in large proportions (approximately 50%) of CD16+ clones. On the basis of the expression of surface CD16 and/or cyCD3 antigen, clones could be grouped in the following subsets: CD16+ cyCD3+; CD16+ cyCD3-; CD16- cyCD3+; and CD16- cyCD3-. All clones expressed CD56 surface antigen, displayed a strong cytolytic activity against NK sensitive (K562) and NK-resistant (M14) target cells, and produced IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor, but not IL-2.

Mitoxantrone is also effective as a component of predominantly palliative treatment regimens for hepatic and advanced ovarian carcinoma. Limited studies suggest useful therapeutic activity in multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Regional therapy of malignant effusions, hepatic and ovarian carcinomas has also been very effective, with a reduction in systemic adverse effects. Mitoxantrone inhibits DNA synthesis by intercalating DNA, inducing DNA strand breaks, and causing DNA aggregation and compaction, and delays cell cycle progression, particularly in late S phase. In vitro antitumour activity is concentration- and exposure time-proportional, and synergy with other antineoplastic drugs has been demonstrated in murine tumour models. Leucopenia may be dose-limiting in patients with solid tumours, whereas stomatitis may be dose-limiting in patients with leukaemia. Other adverse effects are usually of mild or moderate severity although cardiac effects, particularly congestive heart failure, may be of concern, especially in patients with a history of anthracycline therapy, mediastinal irradiation or cardiovascular disease. Mitoxantrone displays an improved tolerability profile compared with doxorubicin and other anthracyclines, although myelosuppression may occur more frequently.

The specificity and the functional significance of the primer cross-linking reaction were demonstrated by the fact that (i) other oligomeric primers, tRNAs, and also template-primers readily compete with radiolabeled d(T)8 for the cross-linking reaction, (ii) under similar conditions, the competing primers and template-primer also inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of MuLV RT to a similar extent, (iii) substrate deoxynucleotides have no effect, and (iv) the reaction is sensitive to high ionic strength. In order to identify the primer binding domains/sites in MuLV RT; tryptic digests prepared from the covalently cross-linked MuLV RT and [32P]d(T)8 complexes were resolved on C-18 columns by reverse-phase HPLC. Three distinct radiolabeled peptides were found to contain the majority of the bound primer. Of these, peptide I contained approximately 65% radioactivity, while the remainder was associated with peptides II and III. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of the individual peptides revealed that peptide I spans amino acid residues 72-80 in the primary amino acid sequence of MuLV RT and is located in the polymerase domain. The primer cross-linking site appears to be at or near Pro-76. Peptides II and III span amino acid residues 602-609 and 615-622, respectively, and are located in the RNase H domain.

Murine monocytes transformed by a recombinant retrovirus containing MC29 v-myc were found to exhibit a proliferative burst to day 28-40 post-infection. There-after growth slowed and cell number remained relatively static to day 80-90 post-infection. During both the proliferative and quiescent periods, the cells were dependent on the myelomonocytic growth factor CSF-1 for growth and viability. Analysis of this transformation revealed that the initial transformants were polyclonal, non-immortal, and non-tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. At day 80-90 post infection, a fresh round of cellular proliferation occurred and, in contrast to the initial burst, growth was sustained allowing the establishment of cell lines. These lines were found to be monoclonal, immortal, growth factor independent and, in certain cases, tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. Associated with the establishment of growth factor independent cell lines was the constitutive synthesis of the myelomonocytic growth factor, CSF-1. Proto-oncogene screening of the initial transformants and the cell lines also revealed the expression of c-raf and the CSF-1 receptor, c-fms. Our results indicate that, following transformation by v-myc, monocytes can progress in vitro to become growth factor independent and immortal and that both monocyte transformation and immortalization can be dissociated from tumorigenicity.",,,,,['v-myc'],,,,,,,

This requires regions in these viral proteins necessary for transformation and is thought to inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the Rb protein by disrupting its interaction with cellular targets. Indeed, regions of Rb required to form a complex with E1a and large T antigen are often mutated in transformed cells. The level at which the Rb protein regulates proliferation is unknown, although one possibility is transcription. We have previously characterized a sequence-specific transcription factor, DRTF1, the activity of which is downregulated as embryonal carcinoma stem cells differentiate. DRTF1 is found in several discrete protein complexes (a, b and c) which are of different sizes but have the same DNA specificity. We now show that one of these also contains the Rb protein and, further, that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the dissociation of the Rb protein from this complex. This requires conserved regions 1 and 2 of E1a that are known to be required for efficient transformation. These results demonstrate that the Rb protein forms a complex with a DNA-bound transcription factor, and suggests that the Rb protein might act by regulating transcription.",['10.1038/351494a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological alterations in response to G-CSF + RA indicated progression of the cells along the granulocytic pathway towards metamyelocytes and granulocytes. However, morphologically mature AML cells remained negative for myeloperoxidase and Sudan black stainings, indicators of granulocytic maturation. Chloracetate esterase positivity and CD15 membrane antigens became expressed on cultured AML cells, i.e. on unstimulated and G-CSF/RA exposed blasts.

In almost all cases clonogenic cells persisted after exposure to G-CSF + RA suggesting that subpopulations of immature cells escaped the action of these inducers.

Combination of these two methods with in situ hybridization demonstrated that most cells of the T cell line IARC 301.5, whose proliferation is stimulated by autocrine IL-2, constitutively synthesize IL-2.

ABVD (doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine) has been the most widely used and has been considered non-cross-resistant. Other programs containing the nitrosourea lomustine have been used with results similar to those with ABVD. A relatively small fraction of relapsed patients remain failure free at 5 years (about 20% to 30%) despite a 30% to 60% second-line complete response (CR) rate. The few randomized trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB], European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) evaluable to assess the efficacy of alternating MOPP/ABVD compared with MOPP alone have shown a small but significant advantage in freedom from progression and/or survival favoring the complex regimens over MOPP. The CALGB trial (8251) included a third arm of ABVD alone. The ABVD and MOPP/ABVD arms had a higher CR rate and superior failure-free survival (FFS) than did MOPP, but have thus far shown no difference between ABVD and alternating MOPP/ABVD, suggesting that full doses of a single regimen are equivalent to the more complex multidrug regimen. The next step in the CALGB program was to attempt to improve ABVD. The substitution of etoposide, an active single agent, for dacarbazine and bleomycin in ABVD resulted in a new regimen, EVA (etoposide/vinblastine/doxorubicin). This program has already demonstrated a 66% response rate in MOPP-resistant/relapsed patients (CALGB 8751).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['10.1093/annonc/2.suppl_1.1 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31587-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,45,,,,

Several isoforms of N-CAM have been identified that are expressed preferentially in different tissues and stages of embryonic development. To examine the primary structure of N-CAM expressed in leukocytes, N-CAM cDNA were generated by polymerase chain reaction from RNA isolated from normal human NK cells and the KG1a hematopoietic leukemia cell line. The sequence of leukocyte-derived N-CAM cDNA was essentially identical with N-CAM cDNA from human neuroblastoma cells that encode the 140-kDa isoform of N-CAM. Inasmuch as N-CAM is preferentially expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T lymphocytes that mediate MHC-unrestricted cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we examined the potential role of N-CAM in cell-mediated cytotoxicity and heterotypic lymphocyte-tumor cell adhesion. N-CAM loss mutants were established from the human N-CAM+ KG1a leukemia cell line, and N-CAM cDNA was transfected into a human colon carcinoma cell line and murine L cells. Using this panel of mutants and transfectants, it was determined that expression of N-CAM on these target cells does not affect susceptibility to resting or IL-2-activated NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of N-CAM in these transfectants failed to induce homotypic or heterotypic cellular adhesion. Collectively, these studies indicate that homophilic N-CAM interactions probably do not mediate a major role in the cytolytic interaction between NK cells and N-CAM+ tumor cell targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since proteinases implicated in cancer dissemination (type-IV collagenase, plasminogen activator, cathepsins B) are normal constitutents of blood, we have explored the hypothesis that elevated tissue levels of activated proteinases bound to alpha 2M might be detected in plasma of patients with cancer. To test this premise, blood was collected from 149 subjects (33 healthy controls, 31 patients with infections and non-malignant diseases, 16 with myeloproliferative disease, 10 with gastrointestinal cancer, 7 with genito-urinary cancer, 16 with lung cancer, 14 with lymphoma, 11 with miscellaneous cancers and 11 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myeloma). Plasma was assayed for alpha 2M-proteinase complexes using a sandwich ELISA which employs a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to a neo-antigenic determinant on complexed alpha 2M and a rabbit polyclonal anti-native human alpha 2M antibody. The concentration of complexed alpha 2M in healthy controls was 14.2 +/- 9.8 micrograms/ml (mean +/- standard deviation). No significant differences in complexed alpha 2M were noted between normal and cancer groups (range 7.4-14.6 micrograms/ml). On the basis of these data, we propose that, in patients with cancer, activated proteinases are bound locally to inhibitors in the tissues and are not available to form complexes with plasma alpha 2M.

Other cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) elevating agents (forskolin, isoproterenol, and the cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cAMP) also inhibited lectin-stimulated IL2 production by T cells, but could not inhibit IL2 production by Jurkat cells. Of the cAMP-elevating agents examined, only cholera toxin (CT) inhibited IL2 production by both Jurkat cells and peripheral blood T cells. Although phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) greatly enhanced PHA-stimulated IL2 production by Jurkat cells. CT remained markedly inhibitory. The combination of PMA and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, also induced IL2 production by Jurkat cells, and this was similarly suppressed by CT, suggesting that a step after initial second messenger generation was inhibited. A prolonged increase in intracellular cAMP levels was induced by CT in both T cells and Jurkat cells, but the maximal level and the length of elevation achieved in T cells were much less than those observed in Jurkat cells. In contrast, PGE2 caused only a modest and transient increase in intracellular cAMP levels in Jurkat cells compared to that noted with T cells. PGE2 induced a more marked and sustained increase in cAMP levels in Jurkat cells treated with isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Moreover, in the presence of IBMX, PGE2 caused a marked inhibition of IL2 production by PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells. Differences in the capacity of PGE2 to induce cAMP could not be explained by disparities in the level of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity as this was comparable in Jurkat cells and in T cells. Thus, these observations indicate that IL2 production by both peripheral T cells and Jurkat cells can be modulated by cAMP-elevating agents. The data suggest that the diminished capacity of PGE2 to inhibit IL2 production by Jurkat cells reflects both a diminished capacity of PGE2 to induce increases in cAMP levels in these cells and an increase in the threshold of cAMP required to inhibit Jurkat cells.","['0008-8749(91)90274-F [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90274-f [doi]']",,,"['AR09989/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR39169/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Initial results showed that only 12% of lymphocyte samples from CLL patients showed increased p-glycoprotein, conflicting with a previous observation that 53% of CLL patients had an increased level of mdr-1 mRNA. Treatment of the cells with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues increased the proportion of patients showing increased p-glycoprotein to 52%.

The effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 alone were similar. Both only minimally stimulated normal colonies derived from CFU-GM when compared to stimulation with MoCM (a mean of 28% of the total colonies and 17% of the colonies greater than 100 cells obtained with MoCM). Similarly, the number of leukemic colonies was substantially less than with MoCM (less than 30% of MoCM) in all but 3/10 AML patients and both were only able to significantly stimulate CFU-L derived colonies greater than 50 cells from 2/10 patients. G-CSF alone stimulated some CFU-L derived colony growth in 9/10 patients but the number stimulated was minimal relative to MoCM in five of the patients and significant stimulation of colonies greater than 50 cells occurred in only one patient. The mean number of normal CFU-GM derived colonies stimulated by G-CSF was 41% of the total colonies and 34% of the colonies greater than 100 cells generated by MoCM. The combination of G-CSF with GM-CSF and G-CSF with IL-3 resulted in a synergistic or additive increase in the number of CFU-L in 5/10 and 7/10 patients, respectively, and a synergistic increase in the size of CFU-L in 5/10. The same combinations resulted in a significant synergistic effect on size of normal CFU-GM derived colonies. There was no evidence of a synergistic increase in the number or size of CFU-L and CFU-GM derived colonies stimulated with GM-CSF in combination with IL-3. In addition, a combination of all three (G-CSF + GM-CSF + IL-3) did not enhance the effect of G-CSF + GM-CSF or G-CSF + IL-3. These results suggest that there is significant heterogeneity among AML patients in the pattern of responsiveness of the leukemic cells to the recombinant growth factors. In addition, their responsiveness does not significantly differ from that of normal progenitors. In view of the current clinical trials with r-CSFs and cytotoxic drugs in AML patients, this issue is important and worthy of further investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,

The antigen defined by SN10 is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain of Mr 36,000 and designated as gp36. The primary reactivity of SN10 is against mature B-lineage leukemia-lymphoma cells. For instance, SN10 reacted with all of the 17 B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma specimens, all of the 15 B chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens, both of the 2 B prolymphocytic leukemia specimens, all of the 3 B hairy cell leukemia specimens, and 2 of the 3 B acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens tested. Of normal peripheral blood cells, only a marginal reactivity of SN10 was detected with a minor subpopulation (less than 1-4% among different specimens) of isolated B-cells from healthy donors. No significant reactivity of SN10 was detected against any other isolated normal peripheral blood cells which include T-cells, granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Furthermore, no significant reactivity of SN10 was detected against normal bone marrow specimens. In immunohistological studies using frozen tissue sections, SN10 reacted well with malignant lymphomas and showed varying patterns of reaction with hyperplastic reactive lymph nodes. Various normal human tissues tested were unreactive with SN10. In general, glycoprotein 36 was more abundantly expressed on fresh (uncultured) leukemia-lymphoma cells than on cultured leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. No significant amount of circulating SN10 antigen was detected in the plasma of leukemia-lymphoma patients or normal healthy donors. Scatchard plot analysis of direct binding of radiolabeled SN10 to a fresh (uncultured) B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell specimen, a fresh B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell specimen, and DND-39 (an American Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) showed equilibrium constants of 5.2, 5.8, and 6.8 x 10(8) liters/mol, respectively. Thus, SN10 shows a high binding avidity to each of the 3 B leukemia-lymphoma cell specimens tested. Ricin A chain conjugate of SN10 killed leukemia-lymphoma cells effectively, whereas the same conjugate showed no cytotoxicity against control cells. Thus, SN10 bound to target antigen on the cell surface was effectively internalized into the cell. The present results suggest the potential of SN10 for therapy as well as for diagnosis of various forms of leukemia-lymphoma, particularly mature B-lineage leukemia-lymphoma.",,,,"['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Heterogeneity of MDS has been demonstrated on the basis of marrow morphology and biologic features and has been useful for prognostication into high and low risk groups for transformation to acute leukemia. Such stratification has been important for evaluating responses to various treatments. These therapeutic options include the differentiation-inducing vitamins retinoic acid and vitamin D, and cytokines such as alpha and gamma interferon, to which there has been a generally low response. The use of intensive or low dose chemotherapy has been associated with relatively low response rates, few durable responses and a high degree of hemopoietic toxicity. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has shown durable responses for a subset of MDS patients, particularly those who are young and who are in the low risk subgroups. however, due to the elderly nature of the majority of MDS patients, and the toxicity associated with BMT, this option has limited utility for most of these patients. Major focus has been on the recent therapeutic use of recombinant human hemopoietic growth factors, particularly G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL3. These agents have been well-tolerated and generally produce a high incidence of sustained improvements in neutrophil counts and marrow morphology, although hemoglobin and platelet counts have generally not been altered. More extensive clinical trials evaluating the impact of these hemopoietic growth factors on the natural history of MDS are ongoing.","['0268-960X(91)90007-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(91)90007-y [doi]']",,,,,,,73,,,,

Large-scale cell culture and genetic technology had to be developed in the seventies in order to provide sufficient amounts of pure substance for meaningful clinical studies and analysis of modes of action. For its specific effects interferon-alpha has first to bind to specific receptors on the cell membrane. The resulting trans-cytoplasmic signals induce a series of biochemical and cellular events, directly or indirectly responsible for anti-tumor or anti-viral effects. Essential initial events are the induction of synthesis of several new proteins such as 2',5'-oligo-A-synthetase, protein-kinase P1 and major histocompatibility-complex antigens (MHC). Further effects comprise a modulation of the cell cycle, cytostatic effects, induction of differentiation as well as modulation of oncogene expression. Finally immunomodulating effects with effects on the monocyte/macrophage system, natural killer cells and indirectly cytotoxic T-cells have been noted. These effects are illustrated by clinical examples such as chronic viral hepatitis, hairy-cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia.",,,,,,,,,"Herstellung, Reindarstellung und Wirkungsmechanismus von Interferon.",,,

Various LCR fragments were inserted into an expression vector consisting of an A gamma-globin promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (gamma-neo). Using these vectors, we determined that a 2.5-kb DNA fragment containing LCR sites I through IV (previously named mu locus activation region [mu LAR]) had activity in all three assays; of the individual LCR sites, only site II was highly active in all three assays. One region within site II, consisting of tandem AP-1/NF-E2 consensus elements, had approximately 10% as much colony assay activity as the entire mu LAR. However, this region did not have detectable activity in a transient enhancer assay in uninduced K562 cells, nor was it capable of conferring hemin inducibility on linked gamma-globin promoters in stably transfected cells. Finally, we tested the ability of the mu LAR to activate promoters (beta-globin and cathepsin G) that are not normally expressed in K562 cells. beta-neo was minimally activated by the mu LAR in transient transfection experiments. The mu LAR increased the number of stably transfected colonies produced by beta-neo, but the absolute number of beta-neo colonies, with or without the mu LAR, was approximately 10% to 20% that of gamma-neo. In contrast, a minimal cathepsin G promoter was activated by the mu LAR in K562 cells. Our results suggest that LCR functions are dependent in part on the environments and the promoters with which the LCR is tested.",['S0006-4971(20)83269-8 [pii]'],,,['DK 38682/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, of 211 cases studied for the expression of CD2 (T-cell marker, sheep erythrocyte binding receptor for T lymphocytes) 45 were positive (21%). In addition, of 298 patients studied for CD19 (B-lymphocyte marker), 41 were positive (14%). Overall, of 170 patients studied for both CD2 and CD19, 56 (33%) were positive. Interestingly, central review of the French-American-British (FAB) morphology of the CD2- and CD19-positive cases showed that FAB M3 was twice as frequent, and M4E eight times as frequent compared with the CD2- and CD19-negative cases. Of 22 lymphocyte antigen-positive cases in which cells were available for studies of Ig or T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, 20 were germline, one had a rearranged Ig heavy chain gene, and one had rearranged TCR beta and Ig heavy chain genes. The presence of messenger RNA for CD2 was demonstrated in four CD2 surface antigen-positive cases, thus validating the cell surface data. Lymphocyte antigen-positive cases had karyotypes commonly seen in AML; 71% of cases with an abnormal clone had t(8;21)(q22;q22), inversion 16(p13q22), t(15;17)(q22;q12), or t(9;11)(p22;q23). The patients with lymphocyte markers had a significantly higher incidence of these karyotypic abnormalities compared with patients with lymphocyte antigen-negative AML (34% v 15%, P less than .02). When the outcome to therapy of the lymphocyte antigen-positive cases was compared with that for the CD2, CD19-negative cases, we found that the CD2, CD19-positive cases actually had higher complete remission rates (75% v 59%, P = .04), and significantly longer time to failure (P = .02; 32.4% +/- 6.0% v 18.0% +/- 4.1% at 2 years) and overall survival (P = .02; 43.5% +/- 6.3% v 26.0% +/- 4.5% at 2 years).

Treatment of HUVEC with 20 microM forskolin or 100 microM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) also increased cell-surface thrombomodulin on HUVEC.

To determine whether activated platelets circulate in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders, we evaluated the binding of monoclonal antibodies against activation-dependent epitopes on resting platelets (P 12, CD 63, and CD 62) in 12 patients with prominent megakaryocytic proliferation (8 patients with essential thrombocythemia, 2 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 2 patients with polycythemia rubra vera). In addition, platelet aggregation in response to collagen, adenosine diphosphate, platelet activating factor, and agglutination with ristocetin was investigated. In 3 patients there was an increased percentage of platelets binding at least 1 activation marker. In 2 other patients, a trend towards increased antibody binding was observed. Binding of the antibody to thrombospondin (P 12) was related to expression of the GMP 140 protein (CD 62, r = 0.76, p = 0.004). There was no correlation of platelet aggregation defects in vitro to increased expression of platelet activation markers or to thrombohaemorrhagic complications. However, circulating activated platelets were detected in three out of five patients with a history of bleeding or thrombotic complications.

The spectrum of diseases associated with leukopenia is wide and includes congenital as well as acquired neutropenias secondary to conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes, AIDS, malignant tumors with or without chemotherapy-enhanced neutropenia, bone marrow transplantation or therapeutic or accidental radiation. The morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases is greatly enhanced during neutropenic phases. Over the last few years attempts have been made to shorten the duration and lessen the severity of neutropenia in patients with the above conditions by administration of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). Both cytokines were successfully tested in phase I and II trials. Treatment with GM-CSF or G-CSF results in a dose-dependent increase of the neutrophil count. GM-CSF also increases the number of eosinophils and monocytes in peripheral blood. The effect of both cytokines on the neutrophil count is transient as long as the underlying disease persists. This prompted the institution of maintenance therapy, which has been successfully used with either cytokine. Long-term treatment is usually well tolerated and results in a reduction in the frequency of infections as well as in the duration of antibiotic treatments. Side effects of GM-CSF or G-CSF are usually mild and include fever, myalgia, bone pain, and erythema. A number of patients developed dyspnea, hypotension, sweating, flushing and erythema after the first dose of GM-CSF in each treatment cycle. This first-dose reaction occurs more frequently after intravenous than reactions were reported with G-CSF. Some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloic leukemia during or after treatment with GM-CSF or G-CSF. Most of these patients presented with an increased fraction of blasts in the bone marrow, which preceded the treatment with the colony stimulating factors. Since GM-CSF and possibly G-CSF may increase the risk of developing acute leukemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, it appears prudent to limit the use of these cytokines in patients with this disease. The subcutaneous route of administration appears to be preferable to intravenous administration, since the incidence and severity of side effects are reduced. While many questions concerning dosage, long-term therapy and combination therapy still remain unanswered, the information presented in this review concerning the clinical use of these cytokines warrants an optimistic outlook.",,,,,,,,120,GM-CSF und G-CSF: Zytokine in der klinischen Anwendung.,,,

A similar pattern of colony growth was detected with all three HGFs in most MDS patients, exhibiting subnormal growth of GM-CFU and markedly poor to absent growth of BFU-E and CFU-GEMM. A common severe impairment in the growth of all colony types with all three HGFs was observed in five patients, four of whom presented with pancytopenia. The stimulation of MDS marrow progenitors with a five-fold higher than control saturating dose of HGFs induced a significant increase in the frequency of one, two, or all three colony types in cultures of 14 patients, whereas colony numbers in control (n = 8) marrow cell cultures were not significantly changed. All four of the non-responders were pancytopenic and three exhibited markedly impaired colony growth. Supersaturating GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-3 increased GM-CFU numbers in six, three, and three patients, respectively. The values for BFU-E were three, six, and seven and for CFU-GEMM two, one, and five. The enhancement of MDS marrow colony numbers by supersaturating HGFs which exert their effects directly or via the action of marrow accessory cells, suggests that the progenitor cell growth abnormalities in these disorders may involve a defect in the capacity of accessory and/or progenitor cells to respond to stimulation with specific haemopoietic growth regulators.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulation of LAM-1 expression is unique in that leukocyte stimulation induces a rapid down-modulation of LAM-1 from the cell surface. In this study, the regulation and function of LAM-1 was studied in detail in normal lymphocytes and compared with the LAM-1 of malignant leukocytes. Modulation of LAM-1 from the cell surface occurred concomitantly with the appearance of LAM-1 in the culture medium indicating that LAM-1 is cleaved from the cell surface. Shedding of LAM-1 was decreased in the presence of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. As with normal lymphocytes, cells transfected with the LAM-1 cDNA and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells also shed LAM-1 following phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure. CLL cells expressed the same Mr LAM-1 protein as normal lymphocytes and LAM-1+ CLL cells were able to specifically bind to HEV. In addition, normal lymphocytes and LAM-1+ CLL cells were capable of binding polyphosphomonester core polysaccharide (PPME) derived from yeast cell wall, a carbohydrate which mimics an essential component of the natural ligand for LAM-1, and PPME and HEV binding was specifically blocked by a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive with LAM-1. The expression of LAM-1 and other adhesion molecules was examined on cells of 118 hematopoietic malignancies. LAM-1 was most frequently expressed on CLL and follicular or diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas, whereas most other malignancies were LAM-1-. Thus, most CLL cells and some non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells express a functionally active LAM-1 molecule which may correlate with their capacity to migrate through the circulation and disseminate into peripheral LN.",,,,"['AI-26872/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

We have characterized Fc gamma R expression on this cell line by flow cytometry, radiolabeled IgG1 and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding assays, and biochemical analysis. Flow cytometric analysis of THP-1 cells with anti-Fc gamma RI, II, and III mAb, and a rabbit anti-Fc gamma RIII F(ab')2 demonstrated that only Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII are expressed by these cells. A panel of anti-Fc gamma RIII mAb (anti-CD16) failed to bind to THP-1 cells. Biochemical studies identified polypeptides of 64 to 78 kDa (Fc gamma RI) and of 42 to 53 kDa (Fc gamma RII). Fc gamma R expression was determined by binding of radioiodinated human IgG1 (to detect Fc gamma RI), mAb IV.3 (to detect Fc gamma RII), or rabbit IgG immune complexes. Thirty-five thousand high affinity binding sites (dissociation constant [KD] = 4.22 x 10(-9) M) for IgG1 were found on THP-1 cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) upregulated Fc gamma RI expression by THP-1 cells 2.8-fold, whereas Fc gamma RI on U937 cells was increased six- to eight-fold by this cytokine. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and vitamin D3 had no effect on IgG1 binding by THP-1 cells. Fifty thousand IgG molecules in immune complexes bound to THP-1 cells. IFN gamma treatment increased this binding by four-fold, PMA treatment resulted in a 50% increase in the number of IgG immune complexes bound, whereas vitamin D3 treated THP-1 cells bound half as many IgG immune complexes as control cells. Binding assays utilizing mAb IV.3 identified 50,000 sites per cell. Treatment of THP-1 cells with IFN gamma, TNF alpha, PMA, or vitamin D3 had no effect on Fc gamma RII expression. That Fc gamma RI plays a predominant role in immune complex binding was demonstrated by inhibition studies. Human IgG1 as well as mouse IgG2a mAb to Fc gamma RII inhibited immune complex binding by 76 to 84%, whereas mouse IgG1 mAb to Fc gamma RII had minimal effect on immune complex binding. Fc gamma R expression may not be linked to differentiation of THP-1 cells since only 1,25 vitamin D3 was able to induce the expression of CD14, a marker of mature monocytic phenotype.",['10.1002/jlb.49.6.556 [doi]'],,,['CA 38055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that cultured normal human bone marrow stromal cells constitutively express LIF message. Further, exposure of these cells to other hematopoietic modulators including interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (but not interferon-alpha [IFN alpha]) increases the level of LIF RNA.

The sequence of the gene and the cDNA predict a 382 amino acid-long protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide and one transmembrane region 73 amino acids from the C-terminus. The extracellular part of the protein contains: a 140 amino acid-long-N-terminal region, 40% of whose residues are serine or threonine potential attachment sites for O-linked carbohydrate, as well as five potential attachment sites for N-linked carbohydrate. Proximal to the extracellular membrane there is a 79 amino acid-long cysteine-rich region. The homology with the human sequence is highest in the intracellular domain (90% amino acid identity) and lowest in the N-terminal region (43% amino acid identity). The protein is not homologous with any other proteins currently in the databases. The expression of the murine gene by a number of haemopoietic progenitor cell lines suggests that the CD34 function in haemopoiesis may be conserved between man and mouse. The high level of expression in a number of embryonic fibroblast cell lines and in brain imply a function outside of haemopoiesis.",['10.1093/intimm/3.2.175 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined the effects of 3'-CTNU on cellular oncogene (proto-oncogene) expression. We found that the expression of the c-myb proto-oncogene was dramatically enhanced in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by 3'-CTNU in murine leukemia L1210 cells, whereas the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene was suppressed. The enhancement of c-myb gene expression was found to be cell type-specific and to involve an increase of the c-myb transcription rate rather than an alteration of c-myb gene structure or increased stability of c-myb mRNA. Further analysis demonstrated that the altered c-myb gene expression was largely due to the presence of 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine, a decomposition product of 3'-CNTU. The expression of five other proto-oncogenes was unaffected by 3'-CTNU treatment.

Studies on inhibition of tumor growth on an in vitro model, in which human breast carcinoma (HBL-100) and human lung carcinoma (H125) cells were used as target tumor cells, confirmed that interferons (IFNs) alpha and beta can amplify the antineoplastic effects of immunochemotherapy by enhancing the cytotoxic activity of effector cells and by antagonizing the immunodepressive effects of radiation or anticancer drugs. Moreover, data obtained from a pilot clinical trial, designed to test the effect of low concentrations of beta-IFN on natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity, pointed out a good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo responsiveness to beta-IFN in cancer patients. The immunomodulating and antiproliferative effects of BRM were also evaluated in a model of viral leukemogenesis in vitro, after infection of cord blood derived mononuclear cells (CB-MNC) with the human leukemic retrovirus HTLV-I. Alpha-and beta-IFN were previously shown to regulate differentially the antiviral competence of recipient CB-MNC, by interfering with viral replication and delaying the emergence of the transformed clone(s). One of the mechanisms of IFN action that contributes to control HTLV-I infection in vitro can be ascribed to their property of partially counteracting the depression of cell-mediated cytotoxicity that follows exposure to HTLV-I. In the light of data previously and herein described, it seems that alpha- and beta-IFN can be considered potential candidates to define combined therapy with antiviral drugs, to control the early stages of retrovirus-associated disease in human pathology.",,,,,,,,86,,,,

The replication of Rauscher virus in BALB/3T3 cell cultures accompanied by direct cytopathic effect (syncytia formation) was suppressed in the presence of Viva-Natural or the other anti-HIV agents in the culture medium. In spite of the antiviral potentials of the four agents in vitro, only Viva-Natural and AZT demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against Rauscher leukemia in mice.","['0304-3835(91)90003-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(91)90003-z [doi]']",,,['CA 12733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Because these cells recognize and kill their targets independently of their antigen specific CD3 receptor, it is unclear how they might discriminate between normal and malignant cells. We now propose one such mechanism for the selective killing of myeloid leukemia blasts. While both CD2+ and CD2- activated killer cells may inhibit the clonogenic growth of myeloid leukemia cells, only the CD2+ subset effectively inhibits the growth of normal myeloid (granulocyte-macrophage and granulocyte) progenitors. This difference appears to reflect differential requirements for cell adhesion molecule recognition between normal and malignant progenitor cells. Inhibition of the growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colonies by CD2+ LAK cells is blocked by antibodies to the CD2-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) (CD58) cell adhesion system. In contrast, these antibodies have no effect on CD2+ LAK-mediated inhibition of malignant cell clonogenic growth. Instead, antibodies to the LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18)-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (CD54) adhesion system reduce inhibition. These differences correspond to differential expression of the CD54 cell adhesion molecule by normal and malignant myeloid progenitor cells because less than 15% of normal CD34 positive cells are CD54+ while greater than 85% of CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia blasts express the CD54 antigen. LFA-3, the ligand for CD2, is strongly expressed by erythrocytes, and these cells competitively inhibit killing of normal but not malignant clonogenic cells in an analogous way to the effects of monoclonal antibody to the CD2-LFA-3 adhesion system. The operation of this effect in vivo may be a basis for selective cytotoxicity by CD2+ LAK against clonogenic myeloid blast cells, and could be exploited further with infusion of appropriate monoclonal antibodies.",['S0006-4971(20)82419-7 [pii]'],,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,

Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels in plasma from patients with septicemia decreased the ratio of the plasma clot lysis rate induced by an anti-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor monoclonal antibody to the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration. This decrease was not as prominent in plasma from patients with DIC, especially those with APL. To explore the character of PAI-1 in these plasmas, we measured the specific activity of PAI-1 by determining the ratio of active PAI-1 antigen to t-PA-unbound PAI-1 antigen. To calculate the amount of active PAI-1 antigen, the amount of t-PA/PAI-1 complex before and after the addition of a fixed amount of t-PA to the sample was measured by a sandwich solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-PAI-1 and anti-t-PA monoclonal antibodies. The assay to measure total PAI-1 antigen used three monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies and had similar sensitivities to free active, latent, vitronectin-bound and t-PA-bound PAI-1. The specific activity of PAI-1 decreased in patients with DIC (43.7% +/- 30.6%) and in DIC cases with APL (10.3% +/- 6.0%) in comparison to patients with septicemia (83.7% +/- 20.2%) or normal controls (85.8% +/- 27.3%). In DIC associated with APL, degraded forms of PAI-1 were detected in plasma by immunoblotting.

Yet, the killing of K562 can be specifically induced by antibodies to CD3 or delta-chains. Although this phenomenon may be caused by redirected lysis, it also raised the possibility that K562 may possess ligands capable of specifically interacting with the gamma/delta receptor. We found that K562 specifically induced both CD3 and delta modulation as well as IL-2R expression and IL-2 production by gamma/delta cells, supporting the idea that the TCR-gamma/delta is specifically triggered by K562 cells. Moreover, although the gamma/delta cell clones lysed other target cells (e.g., Molt 4, U937, Jurkat etc.), these latter targets did not induce delta modulation or IL-2R expression. In addition, F(ab)2 anti-CD3 antibodies inhibited activated gamma/delta T cells from killing K562 but did not inhibit the lysis of the other targets. Taken together, these results suggest that gamma/delta cells lyse some targets by utilizing receptors (perhaps NK-like) distinct from the gamma/delta receptor. We also found that triggering of the gamma/delta receptor by K562 inhibited the capacity of resting gamma/delta to lyse Molt 4 cells under conditions in which the K562 cells were not lysed.

Polystyrene microtitre plates, wells or sticks were firstly coated with a mixture of purified MAbs and then non-purified viral antigens were adsorbed from tissue culture fluid obtained from BLV-producing cells. The optimal conditions for adsorption of MAbs and viral antigens as well as for the ELISA procedure were established. The test is more sensitive and cheaper (no need for virus antigen purification) than the routinely used ELISA using purified virus antigens. The assay is highly specific, rapid, practical and could be easily automated. It is suitable for the detection of BLV-antibodies in blood serum or milk in the large-scale screening programs for BLV-infected animals.","['0166-0934(90)90045-H [pii]', '10.1016/0166-0934(90)90045-h [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh leukemia cells from 19 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were then studied. Specific receptors for G-CSF were demonstrated on blast cells in all 19 cases, the mean number of G-CSF receptors per AML cell ranging from 95 to 1436. G-CSF receptors on AML cells appeared to be a single affinity type, although some variations were observed. The mean number of G-CSF receptors on leukemic cells from patients with either FAB M3 or FAB M2 was greater than that of cells from patients with M1 (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.10, respectively). Moreover, the mean number of receptors for G-CSF on CD13- and CD34-positive AML cells was higher than that on CD13-negative and CD34-positive AML cells (p less than 0.01), and the mean number of G-CSF receptors on CD7-positive AML cells was lower than that for CD7-negative AML cells (p less than 0.10).

Biochemical studies with a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562) grown in cell culture have been done in order to better understand its mechanism of action. Cl-F-ara-A was a potent inhibitor of K562 cell growth. Only 5 nM inhibited K562 cell growth by 50% after 72 h of continuous incubation. The 5'-triphosphate of Cl-F-ara-A was detected by strong anion exchange chromatography of the acid-soluble extract of K562 cells incubated with Cl-F-ara-A. Competition studies with natural nucleosides suggested that deoxycytidine kinase was the enzyme responsible for the metabolism to the monophosphate. Incubation of K562 cells for 4 h with 50 nM Cl-F-ara-A inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA by 50%. Incubation with 0.1, 1, or 10 microM Cl-F-ara-A for 4 h depressed dATP, dCTP, and dGTP pools but did not affect TTP pools. Similar inhibition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools was seen after incubation with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine. Both Cl-F-ara-ATP and Cl-dATP potently inhibited the reduction of ADP to dADP in crude extracts of K562 cells (concentration producing 50% inhibition, 65 nM). The effect of Cl-F-ara-ATP on human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma isolated from K562 cells grown in culture was determined and compared with those of Cl-dATP and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP). Cl-F-ara-ATP was a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. Inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha was competitive with respect to dATP (Ki of 1 microM). The three analogue triphosphates were incorporated into the DNA by DNA polymerase alpha as efficiently as dATP. The incorporation of Cl-F-ara-AMP inhibited the further elongation of the DNA chain, similarly to that seen after the incorporation of F-ara-AMP. Extension of the DNA chain after the incorporation of Cl-dAMP was not inhibited as much as it was with either Cl-F-ara-AMP or F-ara-AMP. Cl-F-ara-ATP was not a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta, DNA polymerase gamma, or DNA primase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,['CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

This inhibition resulted in major changes in the size of the nucleotide pools in CCRF-CEM cells. After a 4-h incubation with 1 microM (6R)DDATHF, dramatic reductions in the ATP and GTP pools were observed, with almost no effect on CTP, UTP, and deoxyribonucleotide pools. When the incubation was continued in drug-free medium, recovery of ATP and GTP pools was protracted. ATP did not return to normal until 24-36 h, and GTP pools were only partially repleted by 48 h. The ATP and GTP pools were not affected when the initial 4-h incubation with (6R)DDATHF was conducted in the presence of 100 microM hypoxanthine. Addition of hypoxanthine to the medium after a 4-h incubation with (6R)DDATHF caused rapid recovery of the ATP and GTP pools. Similar effects were seen when the purine precursor aminoimidazole carboxamide was used in place of hypoxanthine. The effect of (6R)DDATHF on nucleotide pools and the capability of hypoxanthine or aminoimidazole carboxamide to prevent or reverse this phenomenon correlated directly with the inhibition of cell growth. Presumably as a consequence of the decrease in purine nucleotide triphosphate levels, the conversion of exogenously added uridine, thymidine, and deoxyuridine to nucleotides was markedly decreased. These effects were protracted for almost 48 h and were also reversed by hypoxanthine. Differential repletion of ATP and GTP pools after (6R)DDATHF pre-treatment demonstrated that diminished precursor phosphorylation is primarily a consequence of GTP rather than ATP starvation.",,,,"['CA 42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Expression of the transfected gene was found to result in elevated levels of c-myb transcripts, which were not subject to normal down-regulation by differentiation induction.

The complete coding sequence has been determined. The sequence is capable of directing expression of a protein with high sequence homology to HLA-A,B,C molecules but with a shortened cytoplasmic tail. Sequence comparisons demonstrate that this gene is from a separate locus to the 'classical' HLA-A,B,C and 'non-classical' HLA-E and HLA-G loci. Dew3 is equally distantly related to all of these previously described, functional class I genes. It is, however, extremely homologous to a third 'non-classical' gene, HLA-5.4, and to the chimpanzee gene, Ch28. The RNA species it transcribes is shorter than that of the classical genes, due to an altered acceptor splice site which results in the loss of exon 7. The transcription of Dew3 RNA shows a unique pattern of tissue distribution, being expressed in B cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes and absent from T cell lines, fibroblasts and a myelomonocytic leukaemia. A Dew3 protein product was detected after transfection into a human EBV-transformed B cell line but was located intracellularly. The HLA-5.4 gene has been recently designated HLA-F. The Dew3 and X5.1 clones thus represent two new alleles of the HLA-F locus in man.

For this purpose the class II-restricted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme [HEL-(46-61)] was studied in class II-positive B-lymphoma cells (M12.C3) transfected with genes encoding HEL molecules either (i) secreted in high (hi) or low (lo) amounts as soluble antigen [sHEL(hi/lo)], (ii) localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/salvage compartment (ER-HEL), or (iii) anchored on the cell surface as an integral membrane protein (mHEL).

Class II-positive cells endogenously expressing all three forms of HEL antigen constitutively presented the immunodominant HEL-(46-61) determinant with differential efficiency (mHEL, sHEL greater than ERHEL) to a class II-restricted T hybridoma.

The formation of HEL-(46-61)/I-Ak complexes in the ERHEL and sHEL(lo) transfectants was therefore limiting. Mixing experiments with different antigen-presenting cells indicated that the HEL-(46-61) determinant was derived from endogenous antigen rather than by reuptake of shed or secreted HEL determinants.

For example, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been implicated in a variety of immune responses. Conversely, cytokines, a class of immunoregulatory glycoproteins, affect the synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors. This paper examines the role of cytokines in regulating neuropeptide expression in sympathetic neurons. Exposure of cultured explants of the rat superior cervical ganglion to the cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) increased levels of SP. IL-1 beta increased neuronal SP expression in dissociated cultures of ganglion neuronal and nonneuronal cells but had no effect on peptide content in pure neuronal cultures. By contrast, treatment with a differentiation-promoting protein, leukemia inhibitory factor, increased SP in both pure neuronal and mixed cultures, indicating a different mechanism of action for the two molecules. The specificity of the IL-1 beta effect was further demonstrated by the lack of response to treatment with other cytokines, including interleukin 2, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The cell type necessary for the IL-1 beta activity is probably the ganglion Schwann cell. Treatment with a synthetic immunosuppressant glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, blocked the increase in SP after treatment with IL-1 beta. These observations support the hypothesis that neuropeptide expression is regulated, in part, by interactions with specific immunoregulators. In addition, the data suggest a role for SP in mediating the response of the superior cervical ganglion to injury of the ganglion itself or to the fibers innervating it.",['10.1073/pnas.88.8.3200 [doi]'],PMC51413,,"['NS20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

With respect to the effect of IL-6 on growth and survival, three types of lines were found: (1) U-1958, dependent on IL-6 both for growth and survival; (2) U-1996, dependent on IL-6 for growth but not survival; and (3) U-266-1984, Fravel, L363, and Karpas 707, independent of IL-6. Feeder-cell supernatants were as efficient as feeder-cell monolayers in stimulating growth and contained IL-6 as the only growth promoting activity. IL-6 was growth stimulatory and sustained the growth of U-1958 only when the medium contained fetal calf serum. The nature of the serum factor(s) is unknown, but it was excluded to be the IL-6 carrier protein a2-macroglobulin. IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IGF-1, and insulin were neither co-stimulatory with IL-6 nor stimulated growth on their own. Only U-266-1984 expressed IL-6 mRNA.

The mechanism is controversial and suggestions for it include changes in ara-C metabolism, changes in cell cycle parameters, and changes in the balance between self-renewal and determination in blast stem cells. We addressed this issue by measuring the cisplatin sensitivity of freshly obtained AML blasts in rG-CSF, rGM-CSF, or the two together. For comparison, simultaneous measurements of ara-C sensitivity were made. We found that exposure to different factors in suspension altered the cisplatin sensitivity of AML blasts in the same direction as the change observed in ara-C sensitivity. Similar changes in cisplatin sensitivity were seen when cells were briefly exposed to the drug, washed, and then grown in suspension in the presence of different growth factors. Control experiments showed that the conditions in suspension, not in the clonogenic assay in methylcellulose, were responsible for the changes in cisplatin sensitivity. The capacity of high specific activity to inactivate clonogenicity was tested at several times under growth conditions which altered the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin. Whereas changes in survival after 3HTdR and cisplatin both were seen with time, growth conditions that altered cisplatin sensitivity were not associated with changes in 3HTdR toxicity. The data do not support explanations of the effects of growth conditions on drug toxicity which depend either on drug metabolism or cell cycle effects. Instead, the findings are consistent with a model that postulates an association between drug sensitivity and the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in the blast population.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nedocromil sodium caused dose-related inhibition of HRA-N generation by human neutrophils (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L; inhibitory concentration of 50%, 1.5 x 10(-8) mol/L). In contrast, the presence of nedocromil sodium had no effect on HRA-N-mediated serotonin release from RBL cells. In five experiments, with one crude and four partially purified HRA-N preparations, serotonin release from RBL cells exposed to native HRA-N or HRA-N in the presence of nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) was 28% +/- 6% and 26% +/- 5%, respectively. Similar results were found with all concentrations of nedocromil sodium studied. Preincubation of RBL cells with nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) for 0 to 60 minutes also did not affect HRA-N-mediated serotonin release. Likewise, nedocromil sodium (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) had no effect on anti-IgE-induced serotonin release from RBL cells. In 10 experiments, anti-IgE alone or in the presence of nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) induced 32% +/- 6% and 32% +/- 5% serotonin release, respectively. Preincubation of RBL cells with nedocromil sodium before anti-IgE exposure had no further effect. This is the first study of pharmacologic manipulation of the generation of a histamine-releasing factor. It is hypothesized that one possible mechanism whereby nedocromil sodium protects against asthma and allergic rhinitis is through inhibition of HRA-N generation.","['0091-6749(91)90127-A [pii]', '10.1016/0091-6749(91)90127-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively. The sensitivity of a cytochemical-staining combination of PAS positivity and myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase negativity in defining cases of lymphoblastic leukemia remained at 52%; however, the specificity of this combination for lymphoblastic leukemia was 100% (no false positives). Thus, a positive PAS stain, in combination with negative myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase stains, continues to have a diagnostic role in the distinction between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia, and greater immunologic sophistication serves to support this position.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The definitive diagnosis contained prognostic, diagnostic, and treatment information beyond the FAB classification that affected the disease course and patient management. All diagnostic variables were evaluated in each case and were labeled essential, ambivalent, supportive, or noncontributory. Except for gene rearrangement analysis, all variables we studied contributed essential data to establish the definitive diagnosis. Ambivalent findings were rare but could be explained with the knowledge of the total data. All variables, except cytochemical study, whose results were almost always essential, contributed supportive data. Noncontributory data only occurred with cytogenetic analysis in cases that demonstrated normal karyotypes. The FAB classification was established in 20 (74%) of the cases by use of morphologic examination, cytochemical study, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study. With use of the same variables, however, the definitive diagnosis, whose determination required all data, was established in only 15 (55.5%) of the cases. The addition of immunophenotyping increased the definitive diagnosis to 25 (92.5%) of the cases. The use of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase and platelet peroxidase analysis enabled us to definitively diagnose the remaining two cases (27 cases [100%]). Cytogenetic analysis revealed four cases in which essential information was added to the diagnosis. However, because the cytogenetic information usually was not immediately available, the result did not affect the immediate diagnosis or treatment. Surprisingly, the gene rearrangement studies did not yield essential data in any case and in a few cases contributed ambivalent data. This finding should not exclude gene rearrangement analysis in selected cases; however, the data should always be interpreted in light of all clinical and laboratory findings. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to the understanding of the acute leukemias and related entities and shows the impact of newer technologies on reaching a definitive diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A CD14-specific monoclonal antibody was used to isolate the antigen from normal B, B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and a representative Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line (EBVLCL). A soluble form of this protein was detected in the culture supernatant of all the B cell types tested. The molecule expressed in the normal B and B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells was identical in size to the 52,000 mol. wt monocyte-isolated CD14 glycoprotein. A 64,000 mol. wt antigen was isolated from the lymphoblastoid cell line. Similar 2-D gel electrophoretic patterns to that of the monocyte-derived CD14 were obtained from the normal B and B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell-isolated molecules. These similarities were reflected in minor isoelectric point (pI) differences between the polypeptide spots (pI 4.8), in the first dimension, and identical molecular weight (52,000) in the second dimension. The EBVLCL-isolated polypeptide, when analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis, showed a pI identical to that of the myeloid antigen (pI 4.6). The isolated soluble form was of smaller (47,000 mol. wt, normal B and B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells) or similar size (64,000 mol. wt, lymphoblastoid cell line) compared with their corresponding membrane-bound forms. Interestingly, two-colour immunofluorescence analysis showed that only two out of four CD14-specific mAb tested bound to the B cells. We conclude that the CD14 antigen is, in fact, expressed in the B lineage.

They have attracted attention because of their involvement in autoimmunity and lymphoid malignancy in both mice and humans. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome were found to show a striking increase in the number of CD5+ B cells. B cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells frequently express CD5. However, there are arguments against the role for CD5+ B cells in autoimmune disease, particularly in murine and human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Whereas most IgM anti-DNA antibodies are produced by CD5+ B cells, high-affinity, pathogenic IgG antibodies are produced mainly by CD5- B cells. Either of two possibilities can explain the failure of CD5 expression of B cells responsible for producing IgG anti-DNA antibodies: either the cells are conventional B cells or the cells are CD5+ B cells that lack CD5 expression. In studies using SLE-prone NZB x NZW F1 mice and their H-2-congenic progeny, we discussed herein the possibility that CD5+ B lineage cells are also responsible for the pathogenic IgG autoantibody production by phenotypic switching from CD5+ to CD5-, probably under a particular genetic background. A line of H-2-congenic NZB x NZW F1 progeny failed to produce IgG anti-DNA antibodies, but in turn, showed a marked clonal proliferation of CD5+ B cells. Thus, it appears that genetically determined signals for either proliferation or differentiation would lead CD5+ B cells to cause distinct disease, i.e., autoimmune disease or lymphoid malignancy. Further studies using H-2-congenic New Zealand mice may provide insights into the correlation between autoimmunity and related lymphoid malignancy.",['10.1016/0090-1229(91)90016-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,80,,,,

The arylamine carcinogen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), was used as the model substrate in the form of 2-[9-14C]AF, and was incubated with HL-60 cell cultures, both in the presence and absence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) which induces the respiratory burst. The HL-60 cultures were generally employed after having been induced to undergo differentiation to neutrophils by the action of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Comparisons of the amounts of DNA and RNA binding by 2-AF between HL-60 and normal human granulocyte cultures demonstrated close similarities in the amount and nature of nucleic acid binding by this arylamine substrate. HL-60 cells that had been induced to differentiate to neutrophils to the extent of about 80% showed high levels of the respiratory burst along with extensive covalent binding of 2-[9-14C]AF to cellular nucleic acids. Although normal human granulocytes tended to metabolize 2-AF slightly faster than did highly differentiated HL-60 cells, the extent of nucleic acid binding relative to the amount of 2-AF metabolized was similar. A major difference in the metabolic fate of 2-AF in these cell cultures was the unique ability of HL-60 cultures at all stages of differentiation to effect the slow N-acetylation of 2-AF to give 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). Extensive analyses of incubation extracts showed that the major differences in apparent metabolites were quantitative. With few exceptions, both activated HL-60 and granulocyte cell cultures produced the same metabolites, most of which remain unidentified. Studies with inhibitors such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and azide ion further suggest that these two related cell cultures metabolize 2-AF in similar manner. The DMSO-differentiated HL-60 culture is proposed as a convenient model with which to investigate the metabolism and bioactivation of arylamines by human granulocytes or pure neutrophils.","['0009-2797(91)90101-C [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(91)90101-c [doi]']",,,['ES 03631/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

H7 affected a dose-dependent inhibition of PMA-induced thymidine and uridine uptake with ID50 values of 41 microM and 32 microM, respectively. A comparable ID50 value (34 microM) was obtained for H7 inhibition of B-CLL PKC activity in a cell-free system. PMA-induced changes in cell morphology, expression of CD20, CD37 and FMC7 surface antigens together with increased secretion of immunoglobulin were variably abrogated by H7 suggesting that PKC activation is more important in B cell activation/DNA synthesis than in the differentiative response. Consistent with this, expression of a sizable proportion of PMA-inducible genes was not significantly affected by H7.

The latter cytokine also induces the morphological and functional differentiation of these myeloblasts toward monocytes. Each of these two different cytokines suppresses the expression of the c-myc nuclear oncogene, and the selective reduction in c-myc mRNA and protein precedes the cell cycle changes. In order to investigate whether one or more of the growth-suppressive effects of interferon and interleukin 6 are mediated by c-myc reduction, M1 cells were transfected with SV40-driven c-myc plasmid, whose expression fails to be turned off by these two cytokines. A detailed analysis of the responses to interferon and to interleukin 6 revealed that all of the myc-transfected clones have lost the cytokine-mediated G0/G1 type of growth arrest. However, not all of the growth responses to these cytokines were rescued by this specific genetic manipulation, and the cytokine-treated transfected cells stopped to proliferate in a new fashion which was not cell cycle specific. In addition, the myc-transfected cells developed the differentiated phenotype in response to interleukin 6, as determined by the morphological change, expression of Fc receptors, and cytochemical analysis, suggesting that these molecular events can occur in the monocyte cell lineage in spite of the abnormal constitutive expression of c-myc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

RNA-primed Okazaki fragment synthesis was monitored by first incubating whole cell lysates for 10 min in the presence or absence of the compound and then following the incorporation of [alpha-32P]ATP and [3H]dTTP into the primer RNA and DNA portions, respectively, of the Okazaki fragments. In whole cell lysates the degree of DNA synthesis inhibition induced by Fara-ATP was directly related to the extent of primer RNA synthesis inhibition over the entire range of Fara-ATP concentrations tested (10-50 microM). In contrast, primer RNA formation was stimulated by concentrations of ara-CTP (25-200 microM) and aphidicolin (0.5-5 micrograms/ml) that inhibited DNA synthesis. The primer RNA recovered from cell lysates incubated with either Fara-ATP, ara-CTP, or aphidicolin was of normal length, predominately 11 nucleotides. Fara-ATP was a more potent inhibitor of the polydeoxythymidylate primase activity than of the DNA polymerase alpha/delta activities present in the 100,000 x g supernatants of CCRF-CEM cells. Fara-ATP was a noncompetitive inhibitor of DNA primase with respect to ATP [50% inhibitory concentration, 2.3 +/- 0.3 (SD) microM, Ki = 6.1 +/- 0.3 (SE) microM] and the Km(ATP)/Ki (Fara-ATP) was 25. The 50% inhibitory concentration values of Fara-ATP for DNA polymerases alpha/delta activities on calf thymus DNA were 43 +/- 1.6 (SD) microM and greater than 100 microM with respect to dATP and dTTP. The effects of ara-CTP and aphidicolin on these enzymes were opposite those seen with Fara-ATP, since 50% inhibitory concentrations of either ara-CTP or aphidicolin for DNA polymerases alpha/delta did not inhibit polydeoxythymidylate primase activity. The results provide evidence that fludarabine phosphate blocks DNA synthesis in CCRF-CEM cells through inhibition of primer RNA formation. In contrast, the accumulation of primer RNA and RNA-primed Okazaki fragments that is induced by ara-CTP and aphidicolin could lead to the rereplication and amplification of chromosomal DNA segments.",,,,['CA-44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The management of this disorder has been revolutionized in the last decade with the discovery of the efficacy of alpha interferon and the inhibitors of adenosine metabolism, deoxycoformycin and chlorodeoxyadenosine. The best treatment protocol for hairy-cell leukemia has not yet been defined. Patients may still die from their disease, particularly in the early phases of treatment. Conversely, some patients appear not to require treatment and others respond well to splenectomy and need no further therapy. An individualized clinical approach is recommended, with a role for splenectomy in the patient with cytopenia and a relatively low number of hairy cells in the bone marrow. The first line drug treatment remains interferon alpha given for 12-18 months, following which the patient is observed for clinical relapse. Deoxycoformycin remains a useful experimental agent but cannot be recommended for routine clinical use until issues of long term toxicity are resolved. Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a very promising experimental drug, but confirmation of the early data in larger group trials is required. Similarly the adjunctive use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor appears useful, but will need further study in larger groups of patients. There is little or no role for alkylating agents or more intensive chemotherapy in the modern management of hairy-cell leukemia.","['0268-960X(90)90003-B [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(90)90003-b [doi]']",,,,,,,49,,,,

It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia.

Little is known of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in hematopoietic cells. We examined the expression and modulation of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in various proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells. Constitutive expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA was detected in various kinds of hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and activated T lymphocytes, as well as in cell lines KG-1 (myeloblasts), HL-60 (promyelocytes), ML-3 (myelomonoblasts), U937, THP-1 (monoblasts), K562 (erythroblasts), and S-LB1 (HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes). Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases (kb), and no variant sizes were observed. All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA and protein; however; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid suggested that suppression of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in B lymphocytes may be a dominant characteristic. HL-60 cells were cultured with 10(-7) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 to 72 hours, and levels of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and its RNA were examined. Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand. Levels of occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells; but the total number of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors decreased about 50% at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours. Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages. Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA. In contrast, nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased markedly. Half-life (t1/2) of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short (1 hour) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t1/2, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited. Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in myeloid cells and proliferating T lymphocytes.",['S0006-4971(20)83021-3 [pii]'],,,['CA-43277-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis.

Tiazofurin (NSC 286193), through its conversion to the active metabolite, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), is a strong inhibitor of IMP DH. In our clinical trial, tiazofurin caused return to the chronic phase in patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis (Tricot, G.; Jayaram, H.N.; Weber, G.; Hoffman, R. Tiazofurin: Biological effects and clinical uses. Int. J. Cell Cloning 8:161-170; 1990). In K562 human leukemic cells, tiazofurin down-regulated the expression of c-Ki-ras and c-myc oncogenes, which was followed by induced differentiation. We now report down-regulation by tiazofurin of the c-Ki-ras oncogene in a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis. A single tiazofurin infusion (2,200 mg/m2) on days one and two decreased IMP dehydrogenase activity (the apparent t1/2 was 30 min), GTP concentration (the apparent t1/2 was 6 hr), and expression of ras (the apparent t1/2 was 8 hr) and c-myc (the apparent t1/2 was 38.5 hr) oncogenes in the leukemic cells. No further tiazofurin was given, because on days three and four the chemotherapeutic impact became evident in a tumor-lysis syndrome and the blast cells were cleared from the periphery by day five. The decrease in IMP DH activity, GTP concentration, and expression of c-Ki-ras oncogene were early markers of the successful chemotherapeutic impact of tiazofurin in a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis.",['10.3727/095535491820873579 [doi]'],,,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['c-Ki-ras', 'c-myc', 'c/abl']",,,,,,,

This cell line can be induced to differentiate along either the granulocytic or monocytic lineages thus permitting an independent assessment of the effect of p210bcr/abl on growth and differentiation. Cells expressing p210bcr/abl displayed a complete non-autocrine abrogation of IL-3 dependence and an enhanced response to an activity in FBS which is not IGF-I or IGF-II. During the first few generations following infection with the bcr/abl vector, cells became larger with an increased fraction of cells in G2/M and monocyte/macrophage markers were expressed. Four cytoplasmic proteins phosphorylated in response to IL-3 in the parental cell line with apparent molecular weights of 98, 70, 62, and 52 Kd were amongst those constitutively phosphorylated in p210bcr/abl expressing cells. These results suggest that the functional substitution of IL-3 by p210bcr/abl is due to constitutive activation of proteins involved in IL-3 signal transduction.

In response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 32D cl3 cells are induced to differentiate into mature granulocytes (Valtieri et al., 1987). In contrast, no differentiation was observed following G-CSF treatment of 32D cl3 cells infected with a murine retrovirus carrying the wild-type v-src oncogene. Furthermore, cells infected with a v-src temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant did not differentiate at the permissive temperature, however, at the nonpermissive temperature G-CSF induced granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation of 32D cl3 cells infected with ts WP31A (ts LA31A src gene inserted into amphotropic murine leukemia virus 4070A; Anderson et al., 1987) occurred with the same kinetics as uninfected 32D cl3 cells. Temperature-shift experiments indicate that after 72 hours of treatment with G-CSF at the nonpermissive temperature, approximately half of the 32D cl3 cells infected with ts WP31A virus become committed to differentiation. Prior to that time, activation of v-src by shifting the cells to the permissive temperature resulted in the presence of only undifferentiated blast cells after six days in culture. In contrast to normal 32D cl3 cells, cells infected with the wild-type v-src were tumorigenic when injected into nu/nu Swiss mice. Lesions appeared in the spleen, liver, kidney, lungs and lymph nodes following subcutaneous injection. Growth factor-independent cells were recovered from the tumor, spleen, bone marrow and a lymph node of tumor-bearing nude mouse. Analysis of the proviral integration site by inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that the tumor cells were of donor cell origin.",,,,['CA45241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['v-src'],,,,,,,

Supplementation of TNF to culture resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced granulocytic colony formation and also erythropoietin (Epo) induced erythroid burst formation. However, the number of erythroid bursts, stimulated by interleukin-3 (IL-3) plus Epo, increased when TNF was added at comparable concentrations. Further, TNF enhanced eosinophilic colony growth induced by IL-3 or granulocytic-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In GM-CSF cultures TNF (100-1000 U/ml) also induced granulocytic and macrophage colonies. The addition of neutralizing antibodies against G-CSF, GM-CSF, or interleukin-6 (IL-6) to culture did not abrogate the observed effects of TNF, so that stimulation of myeloid colony growth was unlikely to result from the secondary induction of G-CSF or GM-CSF. TNF therefore exerts favourable effects on hematopoietic progenitors responsive to the more primitive colony-stimulating factors (IL-3, GM-CSF) and potent negative effects on precursors reactive to the single lineage G-CSF and Epo. These contrasting effects of TNF suggest that TNF, when available to marrow progenitors at similar tissue concentrations, may drive hematopoiesis within the progenitor cell compartment into selected directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On pre-culture cells, CD33 expression was frequently observed in CD19+, CD10- B-precursor ALL, and CD14 was expressed only on the cells from B-precursor ALL expressing CD19, CD10 and CD20, and B-ALL. After 2 or 3 days of culture without TPA, CD13 emerged on the cells from 21 of 29 patients irrespective of the presence or the absence of fetal calf serum in the culture. Of four patients with CD10+ B-precursor ALL, which showed no expression of CD13 after culture, two had T-cell associated antigens. Whereas the addition of TPA to the culture enhanced the expression of CD13 on the cells from acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), TPA reduced the expression of this antigen on B-precursor cells. These findings suggest that the regulatory mechanism of CD13 expression may be different between B-precursor ALL and ANLL.

B43 MoAb was produced in vitro by hollow fiber technology and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. PAP toxin and B43 MoAb were modified via their free amino groups prior to their intermolecular conjugation. 2-iminothiolane was used to introduce reactive sulfhydryl groups into PAP and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate was used to introduce 2-pyridyl disulfide bonds into B43 MoAb.

Incubation of blasts from three patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/ml), and subsequent binding studies using 125I-G-CSF reveal that TNF downregulates the numbers of G-CSF receptors by approximately 70%. G-CSF receptor numbers on purified blood granulocytes are also downmodulated by TNF. Downregulation of G-CSF receptor expression becomes evident within 10 min after incubation of the cells with TNF at 37 degrees C and is not associated with an apparent change of the dissociation constant (Kd). The TNF effect does not occur at 0 degrees C and cannot be induced by IL-2, IL-6, or GM-CSF. TNF probably exerts its effect through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as the TNF effect on G-CSF receptor levels can be mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate. The PKC inhibitor Staurosporine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as well as protease inhibitors can completely prevent G-CSF receptor downmodulation. Thus, it appears TNF may act as a regulator of G-CSF receptor expression in myeloid cells and shut off G-CSF dependent hematopoiesis.

Eighteen of 20 patients demonstrated specific binding, and Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity (Kd 15-130 pM) G-CSF receptors on the AML blasts. The number of G-CSF receptors varied from 55 to 1,200 per cell (mean 278). In the remaining two patients, specific binding was not observed. The number of G-CSF receptors did not differ significantly between various AML subtypes, but the mean receptor number was the highest on type M2 blasts. A chemical cross-linking study revealed that the G-CSF receptor has an approximate molecular weight of 140,000. Autoradiography showed heterogeneity of the distribution of G-CSF receptors on the AML blasts obtained from a single patient. The number of colonies stimulated by the addition of rhG-CSF varied from 0 to 566 per dish, and blast colony formation was observed in eight of 20 patients. The population mean of G-CSF receptor number expressed by blasts that formed colonies on stimulation with rhG-CSF was significantly higher than that on blasts which did not form colonies. These results suggest that a proliferative response of AML blasts to G-CSF may be predicted when the blasts express a large number of G-CSF receptors. Accordingly, it may be safer to restrict the clinical use of G-CSF to AML patients who have blasts with a low G-CSF receptor expression and no response to G-CSF in blast colony assay.",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07948.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A high-titer, helper-free recombinant retrovirus was used to introduce an activated Harvey RAS gene under the transcriptional control of the Moloney leukemia virus LTR into murine bone marrow cells. Eleven of fifteen mice reconstituted with these bone marrow cells developed fatal thymic lymphomas 10-12 week post-transplant. Analysis of DNA and RNA from tumor cells revealed the integrated proviral genome and provirally encoded RAS mRNA respectively. Immunophenotyping and T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis of fresh tumor cells and of cell lines derived from these tumors showed them to be T-cells arrested midway through thymic development. Despite evidence of proviral integration in marrow cells of mice with thymic tumors, no other hematologic abnormalities were detected. The short latency and reproducibility of thymic lymphoma development in mice transplanted with marrow transduced with this retrovirus suggests a direct causal effect of expression of an activated RAS gene in the transformation of a bone-marrow-derived lymphoid progenitor.",,,,,['RAS'],,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, simultaneous incubation with 1 microM CPT increased the survival of etoposide-treated cells as much as 30-fold. Inhibition of etoposide cytotoxicity was observed at CPT concentrations as low as 0.01 microM and was one-half maximal at 0.1 microM. CPT also antagonized the cytotoxicity of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-M-anisidide and daunorubicin, two structurally unrelated topo II-directed agents. Topotecan, a CPT analogue currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials, had a similar effect. Studies using an alkaline unwinding assay (to measure DNA strand breaks) and Western blotting (to assess formation of covalent adducts involving topo II) revealed that CPT did not alter the ability of etoposide to stabilize topo II-DNA adducts. CPT is a potent inhibitor of both DNA and RNA synthesis. To further assess the mechanism by which CPT diminished the cytotoxicity of topo II-directed agents, inhibitors of DNA synthesis or RNA synthesis were substituted for CPT.

Following a 72-hr exposure to 1 microM 5-Aza-C, the incorporation of [3H]dCyd into DNA was increased 6-fold and the total dCK activity was increased 12-fold, with a peak for both on day 6. The onset of dCK induction was dependent on the length of exposure time. The IC50 values for cell growth inhibition by Ara-C on day 3 were 0.08 microM for HL-60 cells, 12.5 microM for HL-60/Ara-C cells, and 0.55 microM for HL-60/Ara-C cells pretreated with 5-Aza-C for 40 hr. The Km and Vmax of dCyd for HL-60 dCK were similar to those for 5-Aza-C-induced HL-60/Ara-C dCK. The restriction enzymes Hpall, which cleaves CCGG sequences but cannot cleave at sites methylated at the internal cytosines (5'-CMeCGG), and Mspl, which cleaves sequences with internal methylated cytosine but cannot cleave at sites methylated at external cytosines (5'-MeCCGG), were used for DNA methylation pattern determination. The newly synthesized DNA of HL-60 wild-type cells was cleaved by Mspl to a greater extent than that of HL-60/Ara-C cells. After exposure to 1 microM 5-Aza-C for 40 hr, methylation patterns of newly synthesized DNA reverted in HL-60/Ara-C cells to a clevage pattern similar to that in HL-60 wild-type cells. When compared with untreated control, DNAs from 5-Aza-C-treated resistant cells were cleaved to a greater extent by Mspl than by Hpall, suggesting that internal cytosine-residue methylation was relatively uninhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,"['CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that this proliferation is dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and that removal of monocytes from the cell population before culture eliminates this ""spontaneous"" myeloproliferation, suggesting a paracrine role of monocyte stimulation. However, subsequent studies have shown that increased GM-CSF production from the JCML monocytes is not a consistent finding and therefore not a plausible sole mechanism.

Although the primary structure of GM-CSF is known from cDNA cloning, the relationship between structure and function of GM-CSF is not fully understood. Fifteen different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human GM-CSF were generated to map immunologically distinct areas of the molecule. Each of the MoAbs was biotinylated and shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to bind to recombinant GM-CSF that had been affixed to a solid phase. Each of the 15 unconjugated MoAbs was then used to compete with each biotinylated MoAb for binding to GM-CSF. These cross-blocking studies identified eight distinct epitopes of native GM-CSF. Seven of these epitopes were also present in denatured GM-CSF by Western blotting, and four of the epitopes were at least partially conserved on GM-CSF that was reduced in beta-mercaptoethanol. MoAbs to four of eight epitopes neutralized both recombinant (glycosylated and nonglycosylated) and natural human GM-CSF in a GM colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assay and blocked GM-CSF-induced activation of neutrophils. For most of the antibodies there was a good correlation between neutralizing activity and the capacity to block binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils or blasts. Non-neutralizing antibodies to one epitope partially blocked binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils. None of the MoAbs neutralized interleukin-3, G-CSF, or M-CSF. The locations of seven of the epitopes could be partially mapped with regard to the amino acid structure by determining reactivity to GM-CSF synthetic peptides or to human-mouse chimeric GM-CSFs. The neutralizing antibodies were found to map to amino acids 40-77, 78-94, or 110-127. Thus, these MoAbs are useful to identify functional domains of GM-CSF and in identifying regions that are likely to be involved in receptor interaction.",['S0006-4971(20)84197-4 [pii]'],,,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Two approaches have been used to identify these epitopes. At the nucleic acid level, we have constructed env genes with either of two in-frame deletions: pKR2, an env gene with a 681-bp deletion in the gp70 region and inserted into the pSV2-gpt-1 expression vector; and pKR1, an env gene with an 81-bp deletion in the p15E region and inserted into pSV2-gpt-1. Cell clones were established by transfecting Fisher rat embryo cells with pDb (the H-2Db restriction element), pNEO (for G418 selection) and either pKR1 or pKR2. Db and env gene expression was monitored by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies or by detection of viral RNA on Northern blots. Expressor cell clones were tested for susceptibility to lysis by polyclonal anti-FV/Db CTL in 51Cr-release assays. Whereas cells expressing pKR1 were lysed to the same extent as cells expressing the intact env gene, cells expressing pKR2 were resistant to lysis, suggesting that all detectable env epitopes are encoded within the 681-bp deletion. Polypeptides representing the two most likely candidate epitopes encoded in this segment were synthesized and tested for their abilities to sensitize FRE cells expressing Db alone for lysis by the CTL. One 17-mer polypeptide, AGTGDRLLNLVQGAYQA [corrected], functioned as a strong CTL epitope in this assay, but the other 18-mer polypeptide was inactive.

This feature was distinct from the other anti-transferrin receptor antibodies such as OKT9. In the present study, further immunochemical analysis was performed to define the nature of the antigenic site recognized by the Trump antibody. Trump was found to block the binding of transferrin both to solubilized and to surface transferrin receptors; conversely, transferrin could block the binding of Trump only to surface transferrin receptors. Therefore, the epitope recognized by Trump is near but not identical to the transferrin binding site. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin induced both the OKT9 epitope and the Trump epitope, but 12-phorbol 13 myristate acetate induced only the OKT9 epitope. Growth of some cell lines was inhibited by Trump but not by OKT9. No structural difference was found between transferrin receptor molecules reactive with Trump and those reactive with OKT9. In support of these results, Trump was able to immunoprecipitate transferrin receptor molecules solubilized from low-grade follicular lymphoma cells even though it did not bind to the receptors exposed on the surface of these cells.

Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1.

We previously observed acquired IFN resistance in association with neutralizing IFN-alpha 2a antibodies in small numbers of patients with HCL. This finding suggests that the requisite long-term therapy may be compromised if there is an increasing incidence over time of neutralizing antibodies. We performed a follow-up study of IFN antibodies in our patients receiving continuous IFN therapy. All 16 patients who were previously antibody negative remained so. Surprisingly, all nine patients who previously had non-neutralizing IFN antibodies became antibody negative after a median of 14.5 months. Moreover, 3 of 10 patients who had neutralizing antibodies became antibody negative and five had only non-neutralizing antibodies a median of 10 months from the time neutralizing antibody had first been detected.

Inhibition of neopterin synthesis, inhibition of generation of 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetase activity, and inability to detect IFN in serum after subcutaneous injection of IFN-alpha 2a was observed only in the one patient tested with neutralizing IFN antibodies confirming that these antibodies have functional significance in vivo.

DNA synthesis in P388 cells was inhibited by the agents in a manner which was consistent with their ED50 values for cytotoxicity. When P388 cells were treated with these platinum complexes in vitro at doses which caused more than 80% inhibition of DNA synthesis, no significant inhibition was observed for thymidine, kinase, thymidine monophosphate kinase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, or aspartate transcarbamoylase activities. Thus, there was no evidence that these agents inhibited de novo purine, pyrmidine, or deoxynucleotide synthesis. All of the agents did inhibit the nuclear DNA polymerase activity, but the extent of inhibition was 20% or less at doses which caused greater than 70% inhibition of DNA synthesis. Thus, the inhibition of DNA synthesis appeared to be due to cisplatinum(II) drug binding to the DNA bases. This was estimated to be 1 atom of platinum per 1500-3000 DNA base pairs which is consistent with other studies. The platinum complexes with chloro leaving ligands caused considerable DNA strand scission by 24 h at 10 times the ED50 dose, most likely a measure of impending cell death. In contrast, the platinum complexes with malonato leaving ligands did not cause significant strand scission by 24 h at similar doses. They also exhibited a significant delay in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. These data were interpreted as resulting from slower monoadduct to diadduct conversion, but it is not possible to eliminate the possibility of a different mode of interaction with DNA or a different mechanism of cytotoxicity for the malonato compounds.",,,,['CA 34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In order to determine whether this is a cis- or transacting effect, we sequenced the 550 base pairs upstream of the SMS-SB c-fos coding region and found no mutations upstream of the mRNA CAP site. However, two point mutations at positions +23 and +98, respectively, were found in the 5' noncoding region of the first exon. Consistent with the overexpression of c-fos mRNA, the 55 kD c-fos protein is present in SMS-SB cells through detection by immunoprecipitation, but could not be detected in NALM-6 cells. SMS-SB cells however, do not appear to contain more abundant AP-1 DNA binding activity than NALM-6 cells.",,,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myb', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,

Both phenotypic and functional aspects of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation were significantly augmented by gamma interferon (IFN). Gamma interferon had little effect alone but increased butyrate esterase staining and expression of CD14 antigen and the 40 kD Fc receptor (FcRII) in response to 1,25(OH)2D3. Ability to phagocytose IgG-opsonized bacteria, and superoxide burst in response to both IgG-opsonized bacteria and phorbol ester, was greater after incubation with both IFN and 1,25(OH)2D3 than with either agent alone. The degree of functional activation of cells showed a positive correlation with FcRII expression. In addition, IgG-induced generation of superoxide by differentiated cells was considerably reduced by pre-incubation with the anti-Fc receptor antibody IV3. We conclude that gamma interferon augments 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation and functional activation of the U937 cell line.

To define both the phenotype of the responding CTL and the fine specificity of this response, long term T cell lines were generated from two HAM/TSP patients who were from two different countries. Patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes were repeatedly stimulated in vitro with an HTLV-I expressing autologous T cell line. The resultant long term T cell culture was shown to be CD4+ and cytotoxic for targets expressing HTLV-I Ag. Using a panel of synthetic peptides that span hydrophilic regions of the HTLV-I gp46 envelope glycoprotein, the CTL lines generated from both patients were shown to recognize the same region of the HTLV-I envelope between amino acids 196-209 as defined by the synthetic peptide sp4a1. Interestingly, this sequence overlaps a region of HTLV-I envelope that had also been shown to elicit a strong B cell response in HAM/TSP patients (amino acids 190-203). One CTL line recognized this HTLV-I epitope in the context of HLA DQ5 whereas the other CTL line was restricted by HLA DRw16.

Expression of DIA/LIF by mesenchymal cells was shown to be controlled in a paracrine manner by polypeptide regulatory factors. Specific expression of the two forms of DIA/LIF was also demonstrated in the egg cylinder-stage mouse embryo.

Treatment of the erythroleukemia cell line K562 with PI-PLC had no effect on its NK susceptibility. PI-PLC-treated and untreated Molt-4 bound equally well to lymphocytes in target-binding studies with effector cell preparations enriched for NK cells. Susceptibility to cytolytic granules isolated from rat LGL tumor cells remained the same after treatment of Molt-4 or K562 with PI-PLC. Combined treatment of Molt-4 with PI-PLC and rlFN-alpha or rlFN-gamma resulted in additive reductions of the NK susceptibility, suggesting that PI-PLC and interferons act on different mechanisms to protect cells from NK lysis. When expression of a number of antigens on Molt-4 and K562 was analyzed in flow cytometry, only the expression of CD58 was reduced after PI-PLC treatment. The susceptibility of Con A blasts to MLR derived cytotoxic T-cells was not altered by treatment with phospholipase.

During the process of normal liver regeneration, the levels of RaLV RNA were dramatically increased, whereas the levels of 30S RNA did not change. The present study examined several factors that might influence the expression of these sequences in the Rat 6 embryo fibroblast cell line. Rat 6 cells in either log-phase or confluent cultures were treated with cycloheximide, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or the activated carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) for various periods of time up to 48 h. Northern blot analyses of total RNA indicated that cells in untreated cultures in log phase had higher levels of RaLV and 30S RNAs than did confluent cells. Within 10 h cycloheximide (2 or 10 micrograms/mL) markedly increased the levels of RaLV and 30S RNAs in both log-phase and confluent cells. BPDE (100 ng/mL) induced a marked increase in the levels of RaLV RNA at 4 to 10 h, which returned to the basal level by 24 h in the log-phase cells; but no significant change was seen in the confluent cells. The level of 30S RNA also increased moderately in the BPDE-treated log-phase cells and was maximal at 24 h; but no change was seen in confluent cells. Treatment with TPA (100 ng/mL) induced no significant increase in either RaLV or 30S RNA levels in the log-phase or confluent cells. The exposure of Rat 6 cells to 5-azacytidine (3 microM for 24 h) led to a marked increase in the levels of both RaLV and 30S RNAs, which persisted during at least 15 subsequent passages in the absence of the drug. Thus, inhibition of protein synthesis, DNA damage, or hypomethylation can increase the expression of certain endogenous retrovirus-like sequences, but an activator of protein kinase C does not.",['10.1002/mc.2940030606 [doi]'],,,['CA02111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The underlying disorders were glioblastoma multiforme, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and stomach cancer associated with disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow. All patients died eventually. When the underlying disorder has a rare incidence of DIC as in glioblastoma multiforme or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, the possibility of DIC and the need for immediate initiation of replacement therapy should be recognized, although the mortality is very high because the underlying disorder cannot be eliminated quickly. When the underlying disorder has a high incidence of DIC as in acute promyelocytic leukemia or disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow, it is mandatory to start replacement therapy and treatment for the underlying disorder simultaneously. DIC can be controlled when the treatment for the underlying disorder is effective.","['JST.Journalarchive/nmc1959/30.610 [pii]', '10.2176/nmc.30.610 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, p120 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in cells expressing enzymatically activated, nonmyristylated pp60src. Furthermore, p120 was tyrosine phosphorylated in avian cells expressing middle T antigen, the transforming protein of polyomavirus, as well as in rodent cells stimulated with either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor. Analysis of the time course of p120 tyrosine phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells revealed a rapid onset of tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, both the extent and duration of p120 phosphorylation increased when cells overexpressing the EGF receptor were stimulated with EGF. Biochemical analysis showed that p120 (in both normal and src-transformed cells) was membrane associated, was myristylated, and was phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues.

CD34+ myeloid progenitors bound to the extracellular matrices of marrow stromal cell and fibroblast monolayers and to laminin and fibronectin to a lesser extent than to cellular stromal layers. These adhesive interactions were not inhibited by polyclonal antibodies to laminin or fibronectin, nor by 1 mM Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS)-containing peptides. Also, although both normal and leukemic cells expressed the CD18 antigen, binding of these cells to stroma was not inhibited by blocking anti-CD18 monoclonal antibodies. Finally, KG1a adhesion was not blocked in the presence of anti-CD54 (ICAM) antibody, nor was it blocked when galactosyl or mannosyl pyranosides were added.

Based on two light scattering and three color immunofluorescence signals, the normal maturation pathways of both the monocyte and neutrophil lineages could be elucidated. Gradual changes of light scattering properties and cell surface antigen expression defined the pathways of each of the lineages. The consistency of the location of these lineage specific pathways found in normal individuals provided the basis for the discrimination between normal and leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia (ANLL). The position of leukemic cells in patients with ANLL in a five-dimensional space was compared with the position of the maturation tracks in normal individuals. The expression of normal antigens on leukemic cells provided the tools to: (1) distinguish normal from clonal populations of leukemic cells in all 15 patients; (2) detect a lineage predominance, either monocytic or neutrophilic, in all 15 patients; (3) detect maturation heterogeneity in all 15 patients. Although maturation pathways of the monocytic and the neutrophilic lineages were analogous to the normal patterns they were distinct in several ways. The expression of normal antigens on leukemic cells may provide the tools to: (1) obtain a new frame-work for classification of leukemia based on the ability to quantify the aberrant antigen expression and to define a 'distance from normal' based on the characteristics studied (the maturation heterogeneity of the leukemic cells also can be correlated with the clinical outcome of the patients); (2) detect minimal residual disease using the difference in locations of the leukemic cells in the multidimensional space from the normal maturation pathways (3) monitor relapse and changes in phenotypes which may accompany chemotherapy, suggesting the appearance of variant or new clones.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CD7 is also expressed on T lymphocytes in multiple stages of T-cell development, including a major subset of mature peripheral T cells. In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of the human CD7 gene and 5' flanking region. Sequence analysis revealed that the CD7 gene comprises four exons that span 3.5 kilobases. The 5' flanking region (506 base pairs) has a high G + C content and no ""TATA"" or ""CCAAT"" elements. DNase I sensitivity analysis of chromatin from the CD7+ progenitor cell leukemia line, DU528, and the CD7-, CD4+, CD8+, TCR alpha beta + T-cell line, DU980 (where TCR is the T-cell receptor), revealed two distinct hypersensitive sites 5' of the CD7 gene. Hypersensitive site 1, present in the DU980 T-cell line, was located 4.5 kilobases upstream of the presumed CD7 transcription initiation site. Only DNase I hypersensitive site 2, which mapped to the promoter region, was found in the DU528 line. Comparison of the organization of the CD7 gene with that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily revealed that the human CD7 gene most closely resembles the murine Thy-1 gene. Both CD7 and Thy-1 are encoded by small genes with four exons, contain TATA-less promoters, and have a similar functional organization.

Hairy cells produce B cell growth factor (BCGF)-related growth factor(s) and we have previously shown that low mol wt (LMW)-BCGF-induced proliferation of hairy cells is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by IFN-alpha. We therefore suggested that this effect might contribute to the exquisite sensitivity of HCL to IFN-alpha therapy. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha, we have analyzed the pattern of phosphorylated proteins in hairy cells. We detected the presence of a hyperphosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa. This protein was identified as the CD20 molecule (B1), which is a structurally unique phosphoprotein exclusively detected on B cells and expressed during most stages of B cell development. Incubation of hairy cells with mitogenic concentrations of LMW-BCGF induces an additional increase in CD20 protein phosphorylation. In contrast, preincubation of cells with IFN-alpha, but not IFN-gamma, decreases both basal and LMW-BCGF-induced CD20 phosphorylation. CD20 phosphorylation in hairy cells is also reduced after in vivo IFN-alpha administration. In contrast, in one case of a patient unresponsive to IFN-alpha therapy, CD20 phosphorylation is not altered by in vitro IFN-alpha treatment, whereas LMW-BCGF still elicits CD20 phosphorylation stimulation. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha may act in HCL, at least in part, by inhibiting leukemic cell proliferation via regulation of phosphorylation, since CD20 phosphorylation is thought to be associated with cellular proliferation. A model involving dysregulation of CD20 is discussed.",,,,"['GM 37905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 42508/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The mAb AD1 did not inhibit the binding of IgE or of several antibodies directed to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI). Likewise, IgE did not inhibit mAb AD1 binding. However, several anti-Fc epsilon RI antibodies did inhibit mAb AD1 binding as intact molecules but not as Fab fragments. Therefore, the sites on the cell surface to which mAb AD1 binds are close to Fc epsilon RI. The mAb AD1 immunoprecipitated a broad, 50-60-kDa band from 125I-surface-labeled RBL-2H3 cells that upon peptide N-glycosidase F treatment was transformed into a sharp 27-kDa band. A similar 27-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from surface-radiolabeled cells after culture with tunicamycin. Thus, the protein recognized by mAb AD1 is highly glycosylated with predominantly N-linked oligosaccharides. The N-terminal sequence of 43 amino acids was found to be different from any subunit of Fc epsilon RI but nearly identical to that of the human melanoma-associated antigen ME491.

The differentiative capacity of clonogenic granulocyte and macrophage precursors was not altered in children with ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Low density (less than 1.077 g/ml) bone marrow cells were labeled with a panel of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) for the lymphoid (CD2 + CD19), T-lymphoid (CD2), B-lymphoid (CD19), erythroid (anti-glycophorin-A), myelomonocytic (CD13, CD33; single and as cocktail) and monocytic (CD14) lineages. A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse label was used as second step. Unfixed, MoAb-labeled cells were incubated for 24 h with a hypotonic propidium iodide solution for DNA staining. Cells were analysed on a single-laser flow cytometer, operating at 488 nm. The effect of the combined staining protocol upon both s-IF and DNA stainability was evaluated. Only a slight decrease (mean: 29.0%) in s-IF intensity was observed after DNA staining. The percentages of immunofluorescent cells in the bone marrow samples of 10 normal individuals before and after DNA staining were essentially unchanged for all the MoAbs used. The DNA histograms of the immunophenotypically defined subpopulations were of excellent quality with a mean coefficient or variation of 1.8%. This procedure allows the assessment of very low levels of S-phase DNA content, as measured in normal low density blood cells of 8 healthy volunteers (mean 0.07%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['10.1002/cyto.990110710 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Some cases of M1, M5a, M7, and L2 are morphologically similar. In such cases, cytochemical stains can provide an inexpensive and available diagnostic tool. M1 is positive for SBB and MPO. M5a is usually NSE positive, whereas SBB and MPO are negative. M7 usually is ANA esterase, PAS, and AP reactive, and do not stain with SBB, MPO, and ANB esterases. The megakaryocytic lineage usually is confirmed by ultrastructural cytochemistry for PPO or immunocytochemistry for platelet glycoproteins and von Willebrand factor. PAS block positivity and AP dotlike reactivity are suggestive of lymphoid lineage. NSE stains are useful in differentiating M2 from M4. Morphologic and cytochemical techniques also can suggest the presence of certain chromosomal abnormalities such as t(8;21) and inv(16), which may have an influence on prognosis.

Standard remission induction therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia includes L-asparaginase, since the leukemic cells lack asparagine synthetase (AS) activity and require exogenous asparagine. We have used the Chinese hamster ovary cell line N3, which lacks AS activity, as a model to examine a novel mechanism involved in the development of drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Expression of AS in Chinese hamster ovary cells is associated with hypomethylation in the 5' region of the gene. Activation of AS in concert with hypomethylation occurs spontaneously at a frequency of about 10(-6); we have found that treatment with the hypomethylating drug 5-azacytidine induces a reversion frequency of 10(-2). To investigate the possibility that chemotherapeutic drugs induce similar changes, the asparagine auxotrophic cell line N3 was treated with the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase, vincristine, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate. Both L-asparaginase and ethyl methanesulfonate increased the frequency of reversion to asparagine prototrophy to about 10(-5), whereas vincristine and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine had no such effect. Asparagine prototrophy correlated with the demethylation of CpG sites in the 5' region of the AS gene and with the appearance of AS mRNA in revertants. In addition to the specific effect seen with the AS gene, L-asparaginase and ethyl methanesulfonate induced global reductions in methylation of up to 25 and 10%, respectively. The ability of chemotherapeutic drugs to inhibit DNA methylation and thereby activate previously silent genes may enable them to promote the aggressiveness of cancers in vivo, including the expression of drug resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Neomycin-resistant cells expressing surface EGFR were selected by cell sorting using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody 225. The selected cells expressed a Mr 170,000 protein immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 225 and apparently identical to EGFR from A431 carcinoma cells. Infected Namalwa cells expressed 42,000 epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding sites/cell, and Scatchard analysis showed two affinities (Kd approximately 5 nM and approximately 0.5 nM). EGFR autophosphorylation was detected using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies after 5 min exposure to EGF. EGF binding induced rapid EGFR internalization (t1/2 = 9 min) and mobilization of transferrin receptors to the cell surface within 1 min. In fetal bovine serum-containing and serum-free cultures, EGF did not stimulate Namalwa cell proliferation. However, in the presence of 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), EGF caused a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis. DMSO induced a cell cycle block in G1, which was partially reversed by EGF. DMSO induced changes in some B-cell markers suggesting cellular differentiation and increased surface EGF receptor number. Cells grown in DMSO and EGF were established as an EGF-dependent cell line for greater than 12 weeks, whereas cells grown in DMSO without EGF died within 1-2 weeks. Namalwa cells expressing EGFR demonstrated more rapid tumor growth in athymic mice. These studies demonstrate expression of functional EGFR mediating early biochemical and growth responses in a human hematopoietic cell, and indicate that EGFR can be used as an effective model in human hematopoietic cells. Results using DMSO are consistent with studies in other human leukemia cells indicating that agents inducing differentiation can restore growth factor dependence in previously factor-independent leukemia cells.",,,,"['CA23150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

IL-4 was found to co-stimulate the proliferation of splenic B cells in the presence of anti-Ig coupled to polyacrylamide beads (anti-Ig beads) for a period of 4 days. In contrast, IL-4 had little co-stimulatory effect on the proliferative response of splenic B cells to the more potent mitogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC). Moreover, IL-4 inhibited interleukin 2 (IL-2)-induced proliferation of cells co-stimulated with SAC. Mitogen-induced pre-activation of B cells in the presence of IL-4 resulted in a reduction in subsequent IL-2-induced IgM secretion without significantly affecting proliferation. Human B-cell tumours were also cultured over a 2-3 day period in the presence of anti-Ig beads plus IL-2, or IL-4 or both IL-2 and IL-4. IL-4 inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation in all cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and the majority of cases of low-grade lymphoma (LGL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL).

DDATHF has been shown to be an excellent substrate for mouse liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase in vitro, suggesting that intracellular conversion to polyglutamates could play an important role in the action of this antifolate. In this report, metabolic studies of the 6R-diastereomer of DDATHF in the cultured human leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and HL-60 are presented. At both 1 and 10 microM (6R)-DDATHF was rapidly converted to polyglutamates in both cell lines. DDATHF(Glu)5 and DDATHF(Glu)6 were the main intracellular metabolites. After incubation in drug-free medium, (6R)-DDATHF polyglutamates were better retained intracellularly with increasing glutamate chain length. (6R)-DDATHF showed reduced cytotoxicity toward a folylpolyglutamate synthetase-deficient cell line, CCRF-CEM30/6 related to a dramatically diminished accumulation of polyglutamates. The activity of (6R)-DDATHF in CCRF-CEM30/6 cells was decreased after both short and prolonged exposures.

In the present study, we studied the expression of BM5d and BM5e in tissues of infected mice at various times after inoculation in relation to the expression of cytokine genes that may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Northern (RNA) analysis of total RNA showed that BM5d was expressed at significant levels in lymphoid tissues within 1 week of infection and that the levels of expression increased with time after inoculation. By 16 weeks postinfection, BM5d was expressed in all tissues examined. Expression of BM5e was relatively more restricted to lymphoid tissues and was detected at lower levels than expression of BM5d at early times after infection, but this virus was expressed in all tissues by 16 weeks. Infection with the virus mixture was associated with constitutive expression of tumor necrosis factor in all tissues examined and of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in lymphoid tissues within 1 week of infection, and at later times with widespread expression of these cytokines and gamma interferon. Also, the levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 mRNA were significantly increased in all infected tissues during the infection.

To study gamma-GT expression in limited populations, we used a histochemical stain to analyze gamma-GT semiquantitatively in cells of hematopoietic origin. Several human leukemic cell lines, including one with inducible increases in gamma-GT, were stained for gamma-GT and graded 0 through 4+ for the amount of positive granules.

To date, the clinical utility of the interferons has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of their mechanism of action. However, there is supporting evidence that the route of administration, i.e. the pharmacokinetic behaviour, is an important treatment variable. The pharmacokinetics of interferons have been fairly well described. The decline in serum concentrations of interferon is rapid after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution approximates 20 to 60% of bodyweight. Work in animals suggests that the catabolism of interferons falls within the natural handling of proteins. Clearance values vary (4.8 to 48 L/h) across the family of interferons and probably reflect the natural internal digestion and turnover of these proteins. Terminal elimination half-lives range from 4 to 16 hours, 1 to 2 hours and 25 to 35 minutes for alpha, beta and gamma, respectively. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of interferons alpha and beta results in protracted but fairly good absorption: greater than 80% for interferon-alpha and 30 to 70% for interferon-gamma. Interferon therapy is associated with adverse events which are usually mild and reversible. Temporal relationships exist between the degree and duration of adverse effects and the route of administration. Attempts to relate inducible biochemical markers, such as 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, to dose or concentration have met with some success although alterations in these markers have not been shown to relate to clinical response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['10.2165/00003088-199019050-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,85,,,,

In this manner, the treatment of a hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-deficient HL-60 variant (HL-60/var) with 6-thioguanine (TG) was accompanied by lower c-myc mRNA levels. This occurred in the absence of 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate (TGMP) synthesis and without alterations in cellular nucleotide pool sizes. Paradoxically, inhibition of c-myc expression in the wild type HL-60 (HL-60/wt) cell, which is only weakly induced to differentiate by TG, was 5-fold more sensitive to the thiopurine (IC50 = 35 microM). Furthermore, inosine, which blocks the formation of TGMP and enhances the extent of differentiation of HL-60/wt cells, decreased the sensitivity of c-myc expression in the HL-60/wt to TG. These actions of TG and inosine on c-myc were also observed in the human colon carcinoma cell line COLO 320, further dissociating some of the effects of TG on c-myc expression from granylocytic differentiation. The hematopoietic granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) elevated c-myc expression and antagonized the actions of TG on c-myc in the HL-60 cells. GM-CSF more readily antagonized the inhibitory action of TG in the HL-60/var cell line when compared to the HL-60/wt cells, restoring c-myc levels to that of the untreated controls. Hence, TG inhibited c-myc expression by two distinct mechanisms in cells which express high levels of the oncogene: a TGMP-dependent, differentiation-independent process with an IC50 of 35 microM, and a TGMP-independent action with an IC50 of 175 microM that was associated with induction of differentiation and was reversed more readily by GM-CSF.","['0006-2952(90)90085-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90085-y [doi]']",,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

In Mov13 mice, a retroviral provirus has inserted into the first intron of the COL1A1 gene and blocks its expression at the level of transcriptional initiation. We found that regulatory sequences in the COL1A1 promoter region that are involved in the tissue-specific regulation of the gene are unmethylated in collagen-expressing wild-type fibroblasts and methylated in Mov13 fibroblasts, confirming and extending earlier observations. To directly assess the role of DNA methylation in the repression of COL1A1 gene transcription, we treated Mov13 fibroblasts with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. This treatment resulted in a demethylation of the COL1A1 regulatory sequences but failed to activate transcription of the COL1A1 gene. Moreover, the 5-azacytidine treatment induced a transcription-competent chromatin structure in the retroviral sequences but not in the COL1A1 promoter. In DNA transfection and microinjection experiments, we found that the provirus interfered with transcriptional activity of the COL1A1 promoter in Mov13 fibroblasts but not in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In contrast, the wild-type COL1A1 promoter was transcriptionally active in Mov13 fibroblasts. These experiments showed that the COL1A1 promoter is potentially transcriptionally active in the presence of proviral sequences and that Mov13 fibroblasts contain the trans-acting factors required for efficient COL1A1 gene expression. Our results indicate that the provirus insertion in Mov13 can inactivate COL1A1 gene expression at several levels. It prevents the developmentally regulated establishment of a transcription-competent methylation pattern and chromatin structure of the COL1A1 domain and, in the absence of DNA methylation, appears to suppress the COL1A1 promoter in a cell-specific manner, presumably by assuming a dominant chromatin structure that may be incompatible with transcriptional activity of flanking cellular sequences.",['10.1128/mcb.11.1.47-54.1991 [doi]'],PMC359585,,['2 707 RR07004/13/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],['COL1A1'],,['GENBANK/X54876'],,,,,

Polyglutamation defect, therefore, is one of the important factors in drug resistance. In this study, reversal of MTX cytotoxicity by l-leucovorin (l-LV) was investigated using normal human bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cells (G-CFCs), and MTX-sensitive and -resistant leukemic K562 cell lines; the latter showed diminished polyglutamation. Cytotoxicity of 10(-7)M MTX to G-CFCs was completely reversed by an equimolar concentration of l-LV, but with higher MTX concentrations, relatively more l-LV was required. The reversal of MTX cytotoxicity by l-LV was more effective against bone marrow cells than MTX-sensitive K562 cells; this reversal seemed to be correlated to the total intracellular MTX levels as well as MTX-PG formation (low in bone marrow cells and high in K562 cells). When MTX-sensitive and -resistant K562 cells were incubated with MTX under conditions in which the total intracellular MTX levels of both cells were similar, successful reversal of MTX toxicity by l-LV was demonstrated in MTX-resistant cells, but not in MTX-sensitive cells, suggesting that an increase of MTX-PG formation in MTX-sensitive cells may explain the failure of l-LV to overcome MTX cytotoxicity. In addition to competitive reversal of MTX cytotoxicity by LV, noncompetitive reversal relating to variable formation of MTX-PGs is suggested to be another important factor in the mechanism of the reversal of MTX cytotoxicity by LV.",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02529.x [doi]'],PMC5917995,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, hairy cells retained their characteristic phenotype, e.g. positivity for CD22, CD11c, CD25, CD32, and the HCL-associated trimeric protein (t-GP) recognized by the mAbs HML-1, B-ly7, LF61 and Ber-Act8. The most specific marker for identifying a small percentage of hairy cells in peripheral blood cytospins, was t-GP. In alkaline phosphatase/anti alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) stained preparations, t-GP+ hairy cells (provided with large cytoplasm and hairy surface) could be usually distinguished from t-GP+ normal lymphocytes (small-sized cells with smooth surface). In doubtful cases the percentage of residual hairy cells could exactly be estimated by double immunofluorescence staining for CD22 (B-cell marker) and t-GP. The rationale of the test is based on the finding that the small percentage (about 1%) of t-GP+ lymphocytes circulating in the peripheral blood of normal individuals are T-cells of the CD8 subset and not B-cells. The best markers for identifying residual hairy cells in routine bone marrow biopsies were CD45RA (mAb 4KB5) and CD20 (mAb L26).

The exposure of noninduced stem cells to 60 mM ethanol results in an increase in G1 cells, but there is no increase in superoxide production or expression of the Mo1 antigen. When HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate along the myeloid line with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), there is a shift to smaller cell size, an increase in G1 cells and acquisition of the ability to produce superoxide as reported previously by several authors. When ethanol is present during differentiation, there are further increases in G1 cells, and increases in the percentage of cells which produce superoxide and express Mo1, and decreases in mean cell size and total growth during the incubation period. Regrowth experiments after periods of differentiation indicate that the increased G1 arrest seen in the presence of ethanol represents terminal commitment if inducer is present, but in the absence of inducer the increased G1 percentage is readily reversible. Examination of RNA content by flow cytometry reveals a decrease in both the peak and mean G1 RNA content during DMSO or RA induced differentiation. These decreases are accentuated by the presence of ethanol, resulting in a higher G1A/G1B ratio than in nonexposed cells. These findings indicate that ethanol enhances G1 growth arrest in HL-60 cells exposed to myeloid inducers. Partial differentiation occurs during this process, resulting in terminally arrested cells, some of which have undergone fewer postinduction cell divisions than normal and may not be fully competent.",['10.1111/j.1530-0277.1990.tb01229.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In order to clarify the mechanism which underlies the lineage-specificity of the NFE-1 expression, as well as the relationship between the expression of this factor and growth factor responsiveness, we have evaluated the capacity of erythropoietin (Epo)-, granulomonocytic (GM)-colony stimulating factor (CSF)-, and granulocyte (G)-CSF-dependent subclones derived from the interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line 32D, to express 1) NFE-1 mRNA, 2) NFE-1-related nuclear proteins, and 3) chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity when transfected with a CAT gene under the control of NFE-1 cognate sequences. NFE-1 mRNA was found to be expressed not only in cells with mast cell (IL-3-dependent 32D) and erythroid (Epo-dependent 32D Epo1) phenotypes, but also in cells with predominantly granulocyte/macrophage properties, such as the GM-CSF- (early myelomonocytic) and G-CSF- (myelocytic) dependent subclones of 32D. However, a gradient of expression, correlating with the lineage, the stage of differentiation, and the growth factor responsiveness of the cell lines, was found among the different subclones: Epo greater than or equal to IL-3 greater than GM-CSF greater than G-CSF. Binding experiments demonstrated NFE-1 activity in all cell lines except the G-CSF-dependent line. Function of the NFE-1 protein was assessed by the expression of the CAT gene linked to the SV40 promoter and a mutant (-175 T----C) HPFH gamma-globin promoter. High level CAT expression was seen only in the Epo1 cells although low level expression was also seen in the parent 32D. These results demonstrate that the specificity of the expression of NFE-1 for the erythroid--megakaryocytic--mast cell lineages is obtained by progressive inactivation of its expression in alternative lineages.",['10.1093/nar/18.23.6863 [doi]'],PMC332743,,['DK-41937/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The mechanism of cytotoxic action of the compound appears to involve metabolic conversion to the active triphosphate. Fludarabine phosphate has substantial activity against lymphoid malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its single-agent activity in CLL appears at least comparable to those of other conventional combination regimens. Its activity in Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides, and macroglobulinemia, although suggestive, needs to be further defined and clinical trials are warranted in hairy cell leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, and previously untreated myeloma. The compound does not appear active against most common solid tumors. Early clinical trials indicated significant myelosuppression and the potential for severe neurotoxicity. Toxicity on the currently used low-dose schedules includes transient and reversible myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue, and elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum creatinine. Possible pulmonary toxicity has been suggested in several patients. The currently used low-doses of fludarabine phosphate, even with repeated administration, are well tolerated and appear safe with a negligible risk for severe neurotoxicity. Based on its single-agent activity and tolerability, the Food and Drug Administration recently granted group C designation of the drug for the treatment of patients with refractory CLL outside the clinical trials setting. The use of fludarabine phosphate in combination regimens and its impact on the natural history of the lymphoid malignancies is yet to be determined. Fludarabine phosphate may well occupy a pivotal role in the management of CLL and low-grade NHL.",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.1.175 [doi]'],,,,,,,96,,,,

The present study demonstrates that CR2 associates with a complex of membrane proteins that may mediate signal transduction by ligated CR2. Monoclonal antibodies to CR2 immunoprecipitated from digitonin lysates of Raji B lymphoblastoid cells a membrane complex containing CR2, approximately equimolar amounts of CD19, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and three unidentified components: p130, p50, and p20. The complex, which was immunoprecipitated also with anti-CD19, could be dissociated by Nonidet P-40, accounting for its absence in previous studies of CR2. Expression of recombinant CR2 and CD19 in K562 erythroleukemia cells led to formation of a complex that contained not only these two proteins but also p130, p50, and p20, and another component, p14. These unidentified components of the CR2/CD19 complex coimmunoprecipitated with CD19 and not with CR2 from singly transfected cells, indicating primary association with the former. CD19 replicated the capacity of CR2 to interact synergistically with mIgM for increasing free intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the complex mediates this function of CR2. Therefore, CR2 associates directly with CD19 to become a ligand-binding subunit of a pre-existing signal transduction complex of the B cell that may be representative of a family of membrane protein complexes. This interaction between the complement and immune systems differs from that between immunoglobulin and Clq by involving membrane rather than plasma proteins, and by having complement involved in the afferent phase of the immune response.",['10.1084/jem.173.1.55 [doi]'],PMC2118751,,"['AI-22833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28191/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM-07309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Comparison of clinical characteristics between the 58 patients whose leukaemia expressed CD34 and the 33 which were CD34-negative found that patients with CD34-positive AML had a higher incidence of SAML and AHD, a lower WBC at diagnosis, and a more frequent incidence of chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and/or 7.

Using young or Poly I:C stimulated hosts, but not mice with low levels of natural resistance (i.e. older animals or mice treated with cyclophosphamide), slower elimination of treated cells was observed with: (a) FLC-745 cells treated with IFN alpha/beta and IFN gamma and (b) FLC 3C18 treated with IFN gamma. Such a delayed clearance was not observed with: (a) FLC-3C18 cells treated with IFN alpha/beta and (b) EL-4 leukemia cells preincubated with IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma. These results suggest that under selected conditions IFNs can protect leukemic cells from in vivo natural reactivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The HIV-2 RT expression clone was used to generate mutations in HIV-2 RT. There is a strong correlation between the effects of individual mutations on the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. Mutations that profoundly affect the two catalytic functions are not clustered in any particular region of the polypeptide. Those few mutations that selectively affect either the RNase H or the DNA polymerase suggest that, like other retroviral RTs, the DNA polymerase is associated with the amino-terminal portion of HIV-2 RT and the RNase H with the carboxy-terminal portion.

Preincubation of HL-60 cells with human immunoglobulin preparation clearly negated the reactivity by 4A, suggesting that 4A antibody is not reactive to CD7 itself, but it probably binds with immunoglobulin G Fc receptors expressed on HL-60 cells. Five cases of ANLL which were positive with 4A antibody were selected and tested with Tp40 antibody, and only two were found to be positive. Expression of CD7 mRNA in these two cases (but not in other cases) was also demonstrated by Northern blotting with a cDNA probe for CD7 recently cloned in our laboratories, indicating that CD7 is expressed on a certain fraction of ANLL, although the positive cases may be smaller than the reports so far appeared. A Northern blot study was also conducted with two acute lymphocytic leukemia cases and one lymphoblastic lymphoma case with CD7+, CD2-/+/-, CD5-/+/- phenotype and germline T cell receptor beta genes.

Among the cytokines, the interferons (IFN) have been examined in great depth for the therapy of melanoma. IFN are able to modulate host effector cell function, including the tumor cytolytic function of lymphocytes and monocytes. IFN also have the capacity to regulate the distribution of circulating immunoregulatory (T) lymphocytes and the expression of tumor cell surface antigens, as well as class I and II products of the major histocompatibility locus. These activities of the IFN have led to their early application for treatment of human melanoma. The empirical evidence that IFN alpha exerts clinically significant anti-tumor effects against melanoma is reviewed, and evolving status of adjuvant trials of IFN alpha and gamma is noted. New indirect host-mediated anti-tumor activities that may potentially be manifest by IFN have yet to be fully harnessed. The opportunity to obtain meaningful anti-tumor activity in advanced disease or adjuvant settings, at dose ranges below those which are toxic (conventional maximal tolerable), are at hand. The U.S. cooperative groups [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and South West Oncology Group (SWOG)] are studying IFN gamma in pursuit of this goal in advanced and adjuvant settings for melanoma and other tumors. The determination of the clinical role of IFN as biologic response modifiers demands equal commitment to the clinical assessment of immunobiologic mechanisms and anti-tumor effects. The immunologic assessment of IFN and a number of other cytokines is a major focus of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Regional delivery of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) may be the most appropriate and least toxic approach, given their half-life. Regional therapy by the intralesional route has yielded enhanced activity for a range of biologics, including bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Intralymphatic therapy with methanol extraction residue of BCG (MER-BCG) has been tested, and trials are now in progress with IL-2 to assess the optimal dosage by this route. It is likely that the optimal role of IFN and other cytokines will be found in combination with one another, and with different biologic modalities such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, to allow expansion and heightened activity of the desired effector cell populations in the host. Enhanced host toxicities, as well as anti-tumor effects, may require that special attention be devoted to optimal sequence of administration to enhance the therapeutic index.","['0022-202X(90)91217-Y [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12875497 [doi]']",,,,,,,32,,,,

Macrophages harvested from the peritoneal cavities of these mice at 4 or 9 wk postinoculation with LP-BM5 MuLV were analyzed by Northern hybridization for the presence of the defective LP-BM5 virus and their ability to synthesize various cytokines upon induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or (LPS). Neither IFN-alpha or IFN-beta was found to be constitutively expressed in LP-BM5-infected macrophages and in NDV induction studies, and the levels of biologically active IFN-alpha and its mRNA were found to be lower in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in the macrophages from uninfected controls. Similarly, after NDV or LPS induction, the levels of TNF mRNA and TNF protein were significantly lower in LP-BM5-infected macrophages than in macrophages from uninfected mice. The LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages constitutively expressed low levels of IL-1 beta, and when induced with LPS, the relative levels of IL-1 beta were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected macrophages. Although no constitutive expression of IL-6 was detected, the levels of IL-6 mRNA induced with NDV were higher in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in controls. Thus, we found alterations in the expression of selected cytokines in macrophages from mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV rather than a general deregulation of all cytokine expression. These results show that macrophages infected with the defective LP-BM5 virus respond differently to NDV- or LPS-stimulation and suggest that aberrant expression of certain cytokine genes may play a role in the immunopathologic condition in mice with murine AIDS.",,,,"['5T32CA09243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI19737/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

No morphologic features, of hairy cells were evident; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase cytochemistry was negative in all cases. Bone marrow biopsies were available in 8 of 14. Four showed focal nodular infiltrates and two had diffuse infiltrates similar to CLL; two showed only minimal interstitial involvement. All cases expressed multiple B-cell markers, and 12 of 14 had monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. The leukemic cells of all cases strongly expressed CD11c, while CD5 was expressed in 7 of 14; only 1 of the 14 cases expressed the lymph node homing receptor, Leu-8. This unique group of leukemias appears to represent the malignant transformation of lymphocytes arising from a stage of lymphocyte differentiation between that found in typical cases of CLL and that of HCL. CD11c is known to have an important function in cellular adhesion and may be important in determining the pattern of lymphocyte tissue distribution found in this group of patients.",['S0006-4971(20)84864-2 [pii]'],,['Blood. 1992 Aug 15;80(4):1095-6.

However, some patients are resistant and others develop late resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment. To understand the molecular mechanism of this resistance, we have analyzed the expression of 10 IFN-inducible genes in the cells of three resistant patients, two responsive patients, and six healthy controls. Northern blot hybridizations showed that all the genes were induced in in vitro IFN-alpha treated peripheral blood cells of the patients and healthy controls. These genes were also inducible in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of two out of two resistant patients administered an injection of IFN-alpha. We conclude that the resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment of the chronic myeloid leukemia patients we studied is not due to (1) the absence of induction of any of the 10 IFN-inducible genes we studied, including the low-molecular-weight 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthetase; (2) the presence of an antagonist of IFN-alpha in the peripheral blood or bone marrow cells; and (3) the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-alpha antibodies.",['S0006-4971(20)84860-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

From rats that had been treated with either a single, fibrogenic, intratracheal dose of BLM (BLM-AM) or a comparable volume of saline (C-AM), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected, and AM were isolated using Percoll gradient centrifugation. Using a spectrophotometric assay, production of nitrites by AM was measured. C-AM released low levels of nitrites, whereas BLM-AM as well as C-AM activated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide released significant amounts of nitrites. The addition of N6-monomethylarginine, a substrate-specific inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism in activated macrophages, reduced the amount of measurable nitrites released from both BLM-AM and activated C-AM. Similar results were observed when 12 x 10(6) RBC were added to the cocultures. In the presence of N6-monomethylarginine, BLM-AM had no effect on two consequences of BLM-AM-induced cytostatic activity, DNA synthesis inhibition and aconitase activity reduction in the L1210 target cell.

This rather rare enzymatic activity is shared by receptors for some polypeptide growth factors and by the products of Class 1 oncogenes. The antibodies are able to detect proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF. The major phosphorylated protein species are the receptors themselves, which undergo phosphorylation only after the addition of the exogenous factor and only transiently. Phosphotyrosine antibodies were able to detect the products of the retroviral Class 1 oncogenes, which are endowed with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. In fact, in these cases a constitutive phosphorylation of the relevant proteins was observed, which occurred continuously and independently of the presence or lack of exogenous ligands. A tyrosine kinase constitutively activated in human gastric carcinoma cells was detected by P-Tyr antibodies. This molecule has been characterized at the molecular level, and the mechanisms responsible for its enzymatic activation have been investigated. The question of whether the tyrosine kinase identified is responsible for the induction and the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in gastric carcinomas remains to be answered. It is reasonable to suggest that this might be the case by analogy with other situations such as Class 1 oncogenes activated by transduction by retroviruses, abnormal expression of EGF receptors, or deregulated activity of c-abl-encoded proteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, the search for deregulated kinases by means of phosphotyrosine antibodies seems to be useful for identifying new activated oncogenes in clinical oncology.",['10.1164/ajrccm/142.6_Pt_2.S16 [doi]'],,,,,,,38,,,,

A number of genes have been localized in this region including the c-erbA-1 and c-erbB-2 proto-oncogenes, the genes coding for the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and the myeloperoxidase enzyme (MPO). However, the precise location of these genes in relationship to the 17q11-21 breakpoint(s) has not been determined. Using in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosomes, we established the position of the breakpoints in relationship to the c-erbA-1, c-erbB-2, G-CSF, RAR alpha and MPO loci in a series of AML cases bearing 17q11-21 rearrangements. We report: (i) that the respective position of the five genes is centromere - c-erbA-1 - G-CSF - c-erbB-2 - RAR alpha - MPO - telomere; (ii) that the breakpoints of the various AML subtypes are variably located between the centromere and c-erbB-2 in M1 and M2; (iii) that the breakpoints are consistently located between c-erbB-2 and RAR alpha/MPO in M3; and (iv) that the breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the 15;17 translocation is located on 17q21 and not on 17q11-12 as previously reported.",,,,,"['c-erbB-1', 'c-erbB-2']",,,,,,,

Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression was enhanced by both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, and suppressed by TGF-beta and dexamethasone. Northern blot analysis revealed that these reagents regulate the Fc epsilon R2/CD23 expression from mRNA level: both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma increased the amount of Fc epsilon R2/CD23 mRNA, while both dexamethasone and TGF-beta decreased Fc epsilon R2/CD23 mRNA, where the effect of dexamethasone was much stronger than that of TGF-beta.

The antibody is of the immunoglobulin G2a isotype and was derived after fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells with spleen cells from a Fischer rat immunized with a Friend polytropic MuLV. The antibody reacted with nearly all members of the ecotropic, polytropic, xenotropic, and amphotropic classes of MuLVs. Unreactive viruses were limited to the Friend ecotropic MuLV, Rauscher MuLV, and certain recombinant derivatives of Friend ecotropic MuLV. The presence of an epitope common to nearly all MuLVs facilitated a direct quantitative focal immunofluorescence assay for MuLVs, including the amphotropic MuLVs for which no direct assay has been previously available. Previously described MAbs which react with all classes of MuLVs have been limited to those which react with virion core or transmembrane proteins. In contrast, protein immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses established that the epitope reactive with MAb 83A25 resides in the envelope glycoproteins of the viruses. Structural comparisons of reactive and nonreactive Friend polytropic viruses localized the epitope near the carboxyl terminus of the glycoprotein. The epitope served as a target for neutralization of all classes of MuLV with MAb 83A25.

The results revealed a diverse pattern of VH family utilization common to both disease groups in which VH regions most proximal to the IgH joining locus were preferentially rearranged relative to their family sizes with recurrent utilization of several known developmentally restricted VH genes in close to germ-line configuration. These results indicate that biased VH family usage is independent of tumor cell phenotype in B lineage leukemias. This bias may reflect similar stages or compartments in normal B lymphopoiesis from which diverse types of B cell malignancy may arise.

We demonstrate that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta treatment of these cells led to stimulation of DNA synthesis (as shown by increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation up to 35-fold) and also resulted in colony formation of leukemic megakaryoblasts. However, the stimulatory effect of IL-1 was dependent on endogenous production of IL-6, because addition of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to IL-6 abrogated the stimulatory activity of IL-1. In contrast, neutralizing MoAbs to granulocyte (G)-colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and macrophage (M)-CSF failed to counteract the growth-enhancing effects of IL-1. Leukemic megakaryoblasts accumulated IL-6 mRNA and released IL-6 protein into their culture supernatant when exposed to rh IL-1 but failed to disclose transcripts for G-, GM-, and M-CSF under these conditions. Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transcript levels demonstrated that megakaryoblasts constitutively expressed IL-6R mRNA and that these transcripts are down-regulated to undetectable levels upon exposure to IL-1 and IL-6. Increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation by megakaryoblasts could be duplicated by exogenous IL-6 that could be blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6. In conclusion, our results suggest that leukemic megakaryoblasts could produce and secrete IL-6, and express IL-6R, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on these cells is indirect, via production of IL-6 by leukemic cells.",['S0006-4971(20)82105-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of both processes is dose-dependent, with half-maximal and maximal inhibition occurring at 1.5 and 10 ng of TPA/ml respectively. At a similar range of concentrations TPA does not inhibit, but rather enhances, IgE-dependent secretion. When added to antigen-activated cells. EGTA immediately abrogates secretion and stimulates InsP3 production. In contrast, EGTA has only a small inhibitory effect on IgE-induced secretion from TPA-activated cells. In antigen-activated cells, EGTA partially inhibits InsP1 formation, suggesting that, unlike InsP3, InsP1 may in part be formed directly from phosphatidylinositol in a Ca2(-)-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that under physiological conditions the stimulated formation of InsP3 is insufficient for triggering secretion, and that Ca2+ influx is essential. Moreover, InsP3 formation is not obligatory for IgE-mediated exocytosis, provided that the cells are activated by TPA. Secretion from TPA-activated cells, which is independent of InsP3 formation and the rise in internal Ca2+, does not require the presence of external Ca2+, implying that the presence of external Ca2+ during IgE-induced secretion is required for producing the Ca2+ signal and not for exocytosis per se.",['10.1042/bj2700685 [doi]'],PMC1131786,,,,,,,,,,

One of these proteins is decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and the absence of DAF on the surfaces of blood cells leads to the haemolytic symptoms. The molecular biology of DAF and its relationship to paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria symptoms is described in this brief review.

G-CSF functions as an endogenous growth factor in SP CML, and thus is responsible for divisions in maturing leukemic cells leading to an expansion of the compartment of mature cells. In the investigations to be reported below, the effects of various hematopoietic inhibitor molecules on the expression of the G-CSF gene by SP CML bone marrow cells enriched for promyelocytes/myelocytes were examined at the mRNA and protein level. We show that exposure of SP CML bone marrow promyelocytes/myelocytes to recombinant human (rh) interferon (IFN)-gamma but not to rh IFN-alpha, rh tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and rh lymphotoxin (LT) leads to downregulation of G-CSF expression and interruption of the G-CSF-mediated endogenous growth stimulation.

However, the expression and function of CD40 on human B cell precursors (BCP) have not been examined in detail. Two new anti-CD40 MoAb were produced and shown to recognize an epitope indistinguishable from the anti-CD40 antibody G28-5. CD40 was readily detected on normal and leukemic BCP by flow cytometry, and cell surface expression was upregulated by phorbol ester. Despite the ability of normal and leukemic BCP to respond to phorbol ester (PMA) and/or low molecular weight B cell growth factor (L-BCGF), anti-CD40 exerted no stimulatory action and could not enhance the response of these cells to PMA, L-BCGF, or both. Cross-linking anti-CD40 MoAb with rabbit anti-mouse Ig also failed to induce a proliferative response in normal BCP. We conclude that anti-CD40 does not exert demonstrable agonistic effects on normal and leukemic human BCP.

The total cellular uptake of 5-AZA-CdR was greater than Ara-C for the myeloid and B-cell leukemic cells, whereas for the T-cells the uptake of the arabinosyl analogue was greater. Ara-C produced a potent inhibition of DNA synthesis, whereas no inhibition was detected with 5-AZA-CdR during a short incubation. In contrast, 5-AZA-CdR produced a potent inhibition of DNA methylation whereas Ara-C produced a slight increase in the methylation of DNA. This study shows that there are significant differences in the antineoplastic activity of Ara-C and 5-AZA-CdR against human leukemic cell lines of different phenotype and that these differences are related to differences in the metabolism of these two deoxycytidine analogues and to their effects on DNA synthesis and methylation.","['0145-2126(90)90068-K [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90068-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using cDNA probes for human IL-6, granulocyte-monocyte-CSF, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), we identified mRNA for these cytokines by RNA blot analysis of total RNA preparations derived from TE cells. We demonstrated that TE cells produced IL-6 transcripts and that TE cell culture supernatants contained IL-6 biologic activity, as determined by the ability to support proliferation of the T1165 plasmacytoma line. The 1.0-kilobase (kb) transcript of granulocyte-monocyte-CSF was also detected in TE cell-derived total RNA. TE cell culture supernatants contained LIF activity, as determined by proliferation of the murine cell line DA-1a, and a 4.0-kb LIF transcript was detected in TE cell-derived total RNA preparations. The 4.0-kb LIF transcript from TE cell-derived total RNA corresponded in size to the LIF transcripts in PMA-activated T lymphocytes. Thus, using biologic assays and RNA blot analysis, we demonstrated that cultured normal human TE cells produced both immunoregulatory cytokines and cytokines that drive various differentiation stages of human hematopoiesis. Our findings support the hypothesis that TE cells may play a role in providing cytokines that are important for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells that migrate to the thymus during fetal and postnatal human thymic development.",,,,"['AI12026/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR34808/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In fact, these figures underestimate the potency of CS-A, since studies with 3H-CS-A showed substantial adsorption to plastic experimental wares which was inversely proportional to drug concentration. With anti-IgE and A23187, the drug acted promptly when added at the same time as the inducers but, with antigen, inhibition increased with time of pre-incubation.

For TPA-induced release, the drug inhibited the Ca2(+)-dependent but not the Ca2(+)-independent component. In Ca2(+)-free conditions, ionophore A23187, which caused little or no histamine release on its own, was able to synergize with TPA in causing release, apparently by mobilizing intracellular Ca2+. CS-A blocked the synergism but not the original TPA effect. CS-A was compared with the calmodulin inhibitors, W7, TFP and ABCNS; all inhibited histamine release.

In the same cases, biosynthetic labelling and immunoprecipitation studies using monospecific anti-GM-CSF antibodies showed that IL-1 also increased the levels of GM-CSF protein synthesis. Addition of neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies to AML cell cultures completely abolished ongoing GM-CSF synthesis, suggesting that endogenous IL-1 is needed to maintain autocrine production of CSFs. The effects of rIL-2 were investigated in a larger series of 21 patients. The cytokine reduced spontaneous AML cell proliferation in 8 cases. It caused complete disappearance of GM-CSF mRNA in 1 case, and marked reduction of G-CSF mRNA in 2 cases. Increased AML cell proliferation was observed in 2 of 21 cases.

Several reports indicate that conditioned medium obtained from leukemic cells might inhibit the formation of normal hematopoietic progenitors. However, these blast-conditioned medium (BCM) inhibitory activities are not well characterized. In order to evaluate whether BCM might contain an activity inhibiting the growth of normal marrow progenitors, BCM from 13 consecutive patients with ANLL were tested on normal bone marrow in methylcellulose assays. In all the cases, a significant inhibition of the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) progenitors was observed, whereas erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) progenitors were not affected. Further characterization of the BCM inhibitory activity showed using both a biological assay and RIA, the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in 10 out of 13 BCM. Northern blot analysis performed in six patients showed a correlation between the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA by leukemic cells and the presence of TNF-alpha in BCM.

These data indicate that leukemic cells express and release frequently TNF-alpha, which may therefore play an important role in the inhibition of granulopoiesis during leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of topo II mRNA in 16-h stimulated cells in serum-free medium with G-CSF (10 ng/ml) was approximately 2-fold higher than that in cells without G-CSF. Enhanced topo II mRNA expression was detectable within 3 h after the addition of G-CSF. Topo II activity in crude nuclear extracts from 16-h G-CSF-stimulated cells was also found to be approximately 2-fold greater than that from unstimulated cells. According to in vitro cytotoxic assay, the sensitivity of G-CSF-stimulated cells to intercalating (daunorubicin) and nonintercalating (etoposide) topo II-targeting drugs increased significantly, whereas no enhancement of sensitivity was observed with an alkylating agent (4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide). The augmented drug sensitivity observed was not due to the increased level of drug transport, as suggested by the similar extent of [3H]etoposide uptake between G-CSF-stimulated and unstimulated cells. By measuring the topo II mRNA and the cytotoxicity of the above mentioned drugs, we obtained essentially the same results in G-CSF-responsive leukemia cells isolated from three acute myeloblastic leukemia patients, as observed in the cultured cell lines. These findings strongly suggest that the sensitivity to ""topo II-targeting drugs"" could be augmented by exogenous G-CSF through elevated topo II activity in G-CSF-responsive leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1978 and 1985, 177 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) and 97 patients with other intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomized to receive therapy with three courses of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) every 3 weeks with or without low-dose bleomycin by continuous IV infusion. Responders after three courses were further randomized to 3 weeks of therapy with either high-dose methotrexate (3 gm/m2/week intravenously with leucovorin rescue) or standard-dose methotrexate (30 mg/m2/week orally without rescue). Therapy was concluded with three additional courses of CHOP. Neither the addition of low-dose infusion bleomycin nor the use of high-dose rather than low-dose methotrexate had significant effects on response for patients with DLCL; complete response rates for the four treatment programs ranged from 47% to 51%. Median failure-free survival (FFS) for the entire group of DLCL patients was 12 months; 5-year FFS was 27%. There was no significant effect on FFS from the addition of either low-dose bleomycin to CHOP (5-year FFS: CHOP, 28%; CHOP-B, 26%, P = 0.81), or from the use of different doses of methotrexate (5-year FFS: high-dose, 34%; standard-dose, 33%, P = 0.51). Patients with follicular large cell lymphoma, with or without diffuse areas, had a better FFS (5-year FFS, 47%) than patients with DLCL (5-year FFS, 27%), while the patients with the other histopathologic subtypes of diffuse lymphomas had the poorest FFS (5-year FFS, 16%).",['10.1002/1097-0142(19901101)66:9<1888::aid-cncr2820660906>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,,"['CA-04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate whether human basophils express IL-4 binding sites. For this purpose, basophils were enriched to homogeneity (93% and 98% purity, respectively) from the peripheral blood of two chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) donors using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement. Purified basophils bound 125I-radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-4 in a specific manner.

Hypericin was not virucidal to the non-enveloped viruses tested (adenovirus and poliovirus). These data indicate that the mechanism of viral inactivation for hypericin is dependent upon the presence of a viral lipid envelope. In vivo, hypericin (50 mg/ml) was effective against FLV or HSV-1 if incubated with the virus for 1 h at 37 degrees C before infecting mice, but was not effective if pre-incubated with virus for 1 h at 4 degrees C or if administered concurrently with virus.","['0166-3542(90)90015-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(90)90015-y [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The authors compared these two methods in a retrospective study of 36 patients with CML in which they found the bcr/abl DNA recombinant event in 100% (29 of 29) of those patients who had the Philadelphia chromosome. To achieve this sensitivity, a battery of two bcr probes and three restriction enzymes is necessary. The authors propose a sequential algorithm for efficient use of these probes and enzymes. In 76% of the patients, bcr/abl rearrangement can be detected with a Bgl II digest and a 3' commercial probe. An additional 21% of patients can be detected by a second assay in which the same membrane is rehybridized to a 3' and 5' combination bcr probe. One patient (3%) required an additional restriction enzyme digest with BamH I to detect the recombinant event by the same 3' probe. Karyotype analysis is used to determine cytogenetic remission in patients with CML under therapy. The authors studied the use of DNA analysis by the Southern blot technique to detect a decrease in the relative number of leukemic cells. By dilution studies and densitometric scanning of autoradiographs, the authors were able to detect a 15% decrease in the relative number of cells having the bcr/abl recombinant event. The authors report the preliminary results of three patients in whom they compared the karyotype and recombinant DNA analysis at multiple time points in their clinical course. In conclusion, the bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis is superior to karyotype for the diagnosis of CML and can be used for monitoring treated patients.",['10.1093/ajcp/94.4.404 [doi]'],,,"['CA 16086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 43201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In the treatment of leukemia, decreased GVHD has often been associated with diminished antileukemia or graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity resulting in higher relapse rates. However, we have not seen a loss of the GVL effect following transplantation of marrow grafts depleted of CD3+ T cells. This suggests that non-T-cell effectors may play a role in preventing leukemic relapse. To study whether natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity in BM was compromised by T cell depletion, the effect of T-cell-specific monoclonal antibodies against CD3 and CD6 determinants alone, or in combination, on the generation and expansion of NK/LAK cells was examined in vitro and compared to the effect of T depletion on mitogen-driven T cell proliferation. Limiting dilution analysis revealed that T depletion with CD3 and/or CD6 specific antibodies significantly reduced the number of proliferating T lymphocytes but did not significantly affect the frequency of cells able to expand and mediate LAK activity. Bone marrow, depleted of CD3+ or CD6+ T cells, generated levels of LAK activity equivalent to non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow following long-term culture in recombinant interleukin 2. CD3- NKH-1+ cells were the predominant population in rIL-2 expanded marrow cultures prior to transplant and in the peripheral blood of patients who had received a CD3-depleted marrow graft 21-65 days earlier. These studies show that it is possible to selectively reduce GVH-reactive T cells in allogeneic bone marrow while retaining non-T-effector cells with potential to mediate an antileukemia effect in vivo.",['10.1097/00007890-199010000-00020 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The high response rate in relapsed and refractory patients with CLL suggests that Fludara I.V. is the most active single agent for this condition. Nevertheless, a number of issues for the future development of Fludara I.V. must be considered: the optimal dose, schedule, and route of administration (intravenous v oral) remain to be determined. To improve on single-agent results, combinations of Fludara I.V. with other agents are under development for patients with CLL and NHL. Phase III clinical trials will be performed to compare Fludara I.V. with standard therapy versus the combination regimen in previously untreated patients with CLL. A similar study is under consideration for low-grade NHL.

(fludarabine phosphate) is a purine analogue that has been synthesized and found to have activity in lymphoid neoplasms in phase I and II studies. Fludara I.V. has been used extensively in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the last 5 years. In studies of Fludara I.V. as a single agent, the response rate was 59% in 78 patients. The true complete remission (CR) rate (no evidence of disease) was 13% with 16% having a CR with persistent lymphoid nodules. These patients are considered to be in CR using the National Cancer Institute Working Group Guidelines. The other patients (31%) achieved a partial remission (PR). Fludara I.V. has also been used as a single agent in previously untreated patients. Thirty (83%) of the 36 patients obtained a complete or partial response. Thirty-six percent of the patients achieved a true CR and 39% a CR with persistent lymphoid nodules in the bone marrow. Thus, the complete remission rate was 75%. Fludara I.V. has now been combined with prednisone in the management of 101 previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fourteen percent of patients have achieved a true CR, 24% a nodular CR, and 19% a PR. The results were very similar to those obtained with Fludara I.V. as a single agent. Other investigators have explored Fludara I.V. by continuous infusion. Twenty-two of 42 evaluable patients, in that study, achieved a PR. Fludara I.V. had minimal evidence of toxicity except for episodes of fever. The episodes of fever were more common in patients who had received previous treatment and had stage III or IV disease according to the Rai staging system. Some of these episodes of fever were associated with pneumonia. It appears that the spectrum of organisms causing the febrile episodes is that usually associated with immune deficiency (monocyte or T-cell deficiency). Future studies with Fludara I.V. will explore different schedules and combination approaches.",,,,,,,,59,,,,

(fludarabine phosphate) (NSC 312887), which is the 5'-phosphorylated derivative of the novel antimetabolite, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine. The comprehensive phase I evaluation of this new antitumor agent was conducted in 51 patients with advanced malignancy and 15 additional patients with aggressive forms of leukemia. Three separate phase I schedules of drug administration were examined. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity on each schedule administered to patients with solid tumors. The drug was also examined at higher doses in patients with leukemia, and the dose-limiting toxicity on the high-dose protocol was unacceptable: serious neurologic toxicity. The observation of antitumor responses in patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma prompted additional phase II investigation in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancy. The encouraging phase II data demonstrate that Fludara I.V. has promise for patients with low-grade histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. While interesting additional basic and clinical research projects regarding Fludara I.V. remain, it is important to expeditiously pursue approval for this drug. Adequate data exists to demonstrate that the low-dose administration of Fludara I.V. is both safe and effective.

To assess its importance for transcriptional activity, we compared the -202 (C----G), -198 (T----C) and -196 (C----T) HPFH mutations with the normal sequence in binding studies with nuclear proteins from erythroid and non-erythroid cells. Wildtype DNA and HPFH mutations at -202 or -196 showed only a weak protein interaction of unclear functional significance. In contrast, -198 (T----C) generated overlapping, high-affinity binding sites for two ubiquitous nuclear proteins. One cognate protein was identified as the transcription factor Sp1. The second one was termed NF-G.C as it interacted strongly with the homopolymer poly(dG).poly(dC). The generation of additional recognition sites for trans-acting factors by the -198 HPFH mutation correlated with a modest increase in promoter activity in vitro specifically with nuclear extracts from erythroid cells. The activation appears to be mediated by binding of Sp1, but it requires interaction with an erythroid-specific factor, most likely GF-1. Templates containing the -196 HPFH mutation showed a transcriptional activity identical to wildtype. This suggests that despite the topological proximity of the mutations, the HPFH phenotype may be established by different mechanisms.",['10.1093/nar/18.19.5685 [doi]'],PMC332301,,,,,,,,,,

However, the number of target binding lymphocytes was found to be normal in these precancers. Treatment of effector cells with interferon-alpha resulted in highly elevated active killer cell activity, although no change was observed in target binding lymphocyte counts. This finding could imply that precytotoxic cells that are activated by interferon exist in peripheral blood or that direct recruitment of a new cell population takes place. In addition, altered target lysis kinetics was observed, with interferon-activated killer cells demonstrating a tremendous lytic activation that is completed so quickly that a statistical kinetic analysis could not be accurately done.

Specificity studies under conditions that prevent receptor internalization showed that the binding of IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 was not inhibited by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1 beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, or G-CSF. However, receptors for IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 interacted with each other on the basophil membrane, showing a unique spectrum of cross-reactivity, with IL-3 competing for GM-CSF and IL-5 binding, whereas GM-CSF and IL-5 showed little or no competition for IL-3 binding. In order to relate the binding properties of these cytokines to function, they were tested for their ability to influence basophil histamine release in an IgE/anti-IgE-dependent system. We found a hierarchy in the stimulation of basophil with the order of potency being IL-3 greater than GM-CSF greater than IL-5. In addition, IL-3 stimulated larger amounts of histamine release than GM-CSF or IL-5.

Recent studies indicate that HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is unusually error prone and that the number of generated mutations is disproportionately high within repetitive base sequences. To study the ability of recombinant and wild-type HIV RT to traverse specific homo-oligomeric stretches, we used bacteriophage M13 DNA templates that contain different oligo(purine) and oligo(pyrimidine) inserted tracts. The progress of HIV RT along these templates was potently inhibited from further progression only at a (dA)16 insert. Comparison with other polymerases indicates that the almost complete blockage of polymerization beyond an oligo(dA) insert is unique to HIV RT and Moloney murine leukemia virus RT, which has high sequence homology with HIV RT. The extent of termination of HIV RT at the oligo(dA) run is not affected by alterations in the concentration of KCl, Mg2+, dNTP, or by a decrease in pH. Obstruction of HIV RT opposite the oligo(dA) insert is not alleviated by moving the primer position further upstream from the oligo(dA) insert. Lastly, HIV RT purified directly from virions is also specifically arrested at an oligo(dA) tract. Competition experiments indicate that the concentration of active HIV RT in the presence of M13(dA)16 DNA is similar to that observed in the presence of M13(dG)16 DNA. In addition, preincubation of M13(dA)16 DNA with HIV RT does not subsequently inhibit avian myeloblastosis virus RT from successfully traversing the (dA)16 insert. Therefore, it appears that the blockage of chain elongation of HIV RT at the (dA)16 insert is not the result of trapping the enzyme at this site.",['S0021-9258(17)44806-X [pii]'],,,"['68-0570/PHS HHS/United States', 'R35-CA-39903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Both mutants exhibited normal RNase H activity as well as the ability to bind to RNA or DNA templates as judged by UV-mediated cross-linking of the enzyme to the template primers. The enzyme with mutation at codon 421 (Lys----Ala) exhibited properties that were indistinguishable from the wild type with respect to its mode of catalysis, i.e. preference of template primer and divalent metal ion, RNA- or DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, RNase H activity, and the processive mode of DNA synthesis.

Because we experienced some difficulties in radioiodinating intact recombinant human G-CSF, we developed a new derivative of human G-CSF termed YPY-G-CSF. It was easy to iodinate this protein using the lactoperoxidase method because of two additional tyrosine residues, and its radioactivity was higher than that previously reported. The biological activity of YPY-G-CSF as G-CSF was fully retained. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that CML neutrophils had a single class of binding sites (1400 +/- 685/cell) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 245 +/- 66 pM. The number of sites and Kd value of CML neutrophils were not significantly different from those of normal neutrophils (p greater than 0.9).

These CD5 changes have been analyzed simultaneously with modifications of cell growth, cell cycle, cell surface phenotype, and PKC content. CD5 expression was found 6- to 17-fold increased by TPA in a dose-dependent manner on phenotypically mature T-cells (Jurkat, JM, and T-CLL) while T-cells from earlier stages of differentiation (CEM III, CEM 95, and CEM 44) were found unresponsive. CD5 upregulation on TPA-sensitive JM cells appears correlated with inhibition of cell growth, blockage in G1 phase, and phenotypic maturation (downregulation of CD7 and CD1 antigens) and seemed to be related to PKC activation since DiC8 (a PKC activator) mimicked this TPA effect and H7 (a PKC inhibitor) partially reduced it. On the other hand, on CEM III cells TPA induced no modulation of CD5 antigen, a less dramatic effect on cell growth and cell cycle, but a CD7 downregulation. TPA appeared fully effective in binding and translocating PKC in both CEM III and JM cells, although the PKC activity level was three times higher in the latter. Finally, our study suggests that CD5 expression is at least partially under control of PKC in phenotypically mature neoplastic T-cells while PKC could not be directly involved in the regulation of CD5 antigen in leukemic cells arrested at earlier stages of differentiation.","['0008-8749(90)90277-X [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90277-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Intravascular mechanical trauma to cancer cells is thought to be a consequence of shape transitions, occurring when they are deformed from spherical shape by entry into, and passage along, capillaries having smaller diameters than themselves. These transitions from spherical shape require increases in surface area; first, an apparent increase in surface area is accomplished by a reversible, nonlethal surface membrane unfolding. If this is insufficient to meet geometric demands, it is followed by a true increase in surface area, resulting in increased tension in the cancer cell surface membrane, leading to its lethal rupture.",['10.1007/BF02991428 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

We found that two of the multidrug-resistant sublines were significantly less susceptible targets to LAK cells. A third one, however, was as susceptible as the parental CCRF-CEM cell line. Moreover, a multidrug-resistant subline that reverted to an almost drug-sensitive phenotype was observed to be also revertant for resistance against LAK cells. We found an inverse relationship between the expression of the mdr1 gene (P-glycoprotein) and the susceptibility to LAK cells. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, while increasing the drug sensitivity of a multidrug-resistant subline, did not induce a reversal of the suppression of LAK susceptibility. The possibility of enhanced resistance to LAK cells of multidrug-resistant cells should be taken into account when one is looking for therapy strategies to overcome multidrug resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, after a 5-min interval of uptake, free FB levels in dipyridamole-treated cells were 165 pmol/microliters cell water, 2.3-fold greater than in dipyridamole-free cultures. This indicated the presence of a concentrative, dipyridamole-insensitive nucleoside transport (NT) system in L1210 cells, in addition to the equilibrative NT systems known to be expressed in these cells. The concentrative system was demonstrable only in the presence of NT inhibitors and required extracellular Na+. The presence of 8 microM 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D- ribofuranosylpurine or 15 microM dilazep also induced an accumulation of free FB above steady-state levels, although of a lesser magnitude than that observed with dipyridamole. It appears that NT inhibitors induced nucleoside accumulation by inhibiting bidirectional nucleoside movements mediated by the equilibrative component of nucleoside transport in L1210/C2 cells without interfering with inward FB fluxes mediated by the Na(+)-dependent transporter. The presence of NT inhibitors also enhanced the cellular accumulation and retention of arabinosyladenine and its 5'-triphosphate in these cells. The increased cellular accumulation of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine triphosphate by dipyridamole was associated with enhanced antiproliferative activity of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine towards the leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the growth-inhibitory effects of gallium nitrate in combination with clinically relevant inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase fludarabine (an M1 subunit inhibitor), and iron chelators (M2 subunit inhibitors). Fludarabine and gallium nitrate in combination produced a significant increase in cell growth inhibition when compared with either agent alone; however, this effect was partially reversible up to 24 h and was best seen with continuous exposure of cells to both drugs. Incubation of cells with desferrioxamine and gallium nitrate resulted in reversal of gallium-induced growth inhibition. Incubation of cells with N,N'-bis(o-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid and gallium nitrate resulted in a slight increase in gallium-induced growth inhibition, with partial restoration of cell growth occurring only at a single high concentration of N,N'-bis(o-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid. Both chelators inhibited 67Ga uptake by cells and increased cell surface transferrin receptors. In contrast to the coincubation studies, sequential exposure of cells to desferrioxamine or N,N'-bis(o-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid and gallium nitrate resulted in a significant potentiation of the growth-inhibitory effects of gallium nitrate.

ES cells acquired a differentiated phenotype in monolayer, either when in the absence of LIF/DIA or in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). We have now characterized this bipotential differentiation of ES cells in terms of a series of extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins as well as cytokeratin expression, and compared it with the changes observed during the differentiation of two embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines, P19 and F9. ES cells exposed to RA in the presence of LIF/DIA largely resembled F9 EC + RA after 5 days, while ES cells deprived of LIF/DIA formed a culture with mixed phenotype resembling P19 EC + RA.

The cells growing in suspension culture resembled myeloblasts on the basis of morphologic, cytochemical and surface phenotypic analyses. Other CSFs, interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not support the growth of OCI/AML 1a cells so well as G-CSF. The effect on the growth of OCI/AML 1a cells of G-CSF was almost completely abolished by neutralizing monoclonal anti-G-CSF antibody. These findings showed that OCI/AML 1a cells required G-CSF for growth. OCI/AML 1a cell line will be valuable for studies of the biological nature, proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells.

In the malignant cases, the 4F2 antigen was expressed by 94 (64%) B-cell NHL and all six plasma cell tumors. The incidence of positivity and intensity of expression loosely correlated with the three morphologic grades of NHL identified in the Working Formulation. Approximately one half of all low-grade lymphomas, two thirds of intermediate-grade lymphomas, and all high-grade lymphomas were 4F2 positive. Similarly, the mean intensity of 4F2 antigen expression increased with higher grade. However, for certain histologic subtypes, 4F2 antigen expression did not correlate with morphologic grade. For example, in the intermediate-grade category less than one half of diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas were 4F2 positive, and expression was weak, similar to that of low-grade lymphomas. In contrast, all other histologic subtypes of lymphoma in the intermediate-grade category were strongly 4F2 positive. Expression of 4F2 antigen also correlated with plasmacytoid differentiation.

The low complete remission rates were attributable to bone marrow invasion in 64% (16/25) of patients in groups 1 and 2, and 64% (9/14) in group 3; to extensive gastrointestinal tract involvement in 24% (6/25) of patients in groups 1 and 2, and 36% (5/14) in group 3; and to high bulk disease in 24% (6/25) of patients in groups 1 and 2, and 36% (5/14) in group 3. Actuarially predicted survival has not been reached for group 1, is 12 months for group 2, and 8 months for group 3; these different trends are not statistically significant. The trial was discontinued when it became clear that there was no difference between the two- and five-drug treatment regimens and that unacceptably low remission rates were obtained in patients having a high incidence of these poor prognostic factors, particularly when compared with results being reported in regimens that contain high or intermediate doses of methotrexate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effects of various humoral factors on CD5 expression by cells of a subcloned 70Z/3 murine pre-B leukemia cell line were investigated. Among the humoral factors studied, only LPS up-regulated CD5 expression on 70Z/3 cells (three- to fourfold) in a dose-dependent manner. However, this up-regulatory effect of LPS was not observed when cells were cultured in serum-free medium. NZB-serum factor (NZB-SF), a cytokine we have identified and shown to enhance the maturation and proliferation of immature B cells, synergistically enhanced CD5 expression in the presence of suboptimal doses of LPS. IL-4 down-regulated CD5 expression by 70Z/3 cells induced by LPS or LPS plus NZB-SF in a dose-dependent manner. IL-4 also suppressed spontaneous CD5 expression by 70Z/3 cells. No other cytokine tested showed an inhibitory effect. LPS, IFN-gamma, NZB-SF, and IL-1 enhanced sIg expression on 70Z/3 cells and their action on sIg expression was not inhibited by IL-4. Thus, the down-regulatory action of IL-4 on CD5 expression appeared specific for this antigen. IFN-gamma, which inhibits IL-4 induced CD23 and DR expression on B cells, does not abolish the down-regulatory action of IL-4 on CD5 expression by 70Z/3 cells. Changes in mRNA levels on coding CD5 were also examined following the incubation of 70Z/3 cells (24 hr) in the presence of humoral factors which can influence CD5 Ag expression. The levels of mRNA for CD5 Ag were moderately increased in the presence of LPS and NZB-SF. IL-4 appeared to suppress the actions of NZB-SF and LPS at least in part by reducing the levels of mRNA encoding CD5.","['0008-8749(90)90162-K [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90162-k [doi]']",,,"['AI22360/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI25062/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This antigen is also largely expressed on the B cells from bovine leukemia virus-infected animals. Molecules with a similar cell distribution have been described in other species (mouse, human, rat and sheep), and were termed CD5 molecules. In order to confirm the CD5-like nature of the target molecule recognized by 8C11, functional T-cell assays were carried out. We report here that this mAb, like its human and murine homologues, enhances the proliferative responses of T cells to mitogens or alloantigens but does not directly stimulate T-cell division. Moreover, we have shown an enhancing effect of this 8C11 mAb on bovine interleukin-2 production by concanavalin A-stimulated bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","['0165-2427(90)90048-W [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(90)90048-w [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although colony-stimulating factors have been shown to accelerate recovery from severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, their use in acute leukemia has been controversial because in vitro they stimulate leukemic colonies as well as normal granulocyte colonies. Methods. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) after a standard course of intensive therapy in 108 patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia (67 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 30 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 9 in blast crisis from chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 2 with acute leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes). Treatment with granulocyte CSF (200 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area per day in a 30-minute infusion) was begun two days after the end of the chemotherapy and continued until the neutrophil count rose above 1500 per cubic millimeter. Results. Treatment with granulocyte CSF accelerated the recovery of neutrophils significantly (P less than 0.01), shortening it by about a week, but it had no effect on platelet recovery. Although the incidence of febrile episodes was almost the same, documented infections were significantly less frequent in the group treated with granulocyte CSF (P = 0.028). There was no evidence that granulocyte CSF accelerated the regrowth of leukemic cells. Fifty percent of 48 patients in the CSF group who could be evaluated and 36 percent of 50 controls had complete remission. The rate of relapse was almost the same in the two groups. Conclusions. It appears that recombinant human granulocyte CSF is safe in acute leukemia, accelerating neutrophil recovery and thereby reducing the incidence of documented infection without affecting the regrowth of leukemic cells. It should be used with caution, however, pending further confirmation of these early results.",['10.1056/NEJM199009273231304 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The number of CFU-GM in MM was significantly less than in normal subjects (51.2 +/- 30.6 CFU-GM/ml). The number of CFU-GM in PB in all patients began to rise between 2 days before and 8 days after nadir of WBC count, and then reached the peak at the subsequent 5 days.

Active tumour promoter agents (TPA), such as phorbol ester analogues [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PBu2)] and mezerein, were able to increase the expression of CD5 on the cell surface of all T-cell lines), as deduced from immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis. The TPA-induced CD5 up-regulation occurred in a dose-and time-dependent manner and was dependent on protein and RNA synthesis. From the other stimuli tested, the T-cell mitogens [phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A)], as well as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the CD3 complex, also increased CD5 expression, although to a lesser degree. In all cases the increments were shown to be dependent on protein kinase C (PKC), as evidenced by their inhibition with staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC activation. These data suggest that CD5 up-regulation on T cells can be a physiological event that depends on PKC activation.",,PMC1384245,,,,,,,,,,

When transcription is initiated normally, this block is expected to produce a truncated RNA, but to date, this product has escaped direct detection in somatic cells. We have been able to detect a 0.38 kb c-myc exon-1 specific RNA species by northern blot analysis. This RNA appeared not only in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced HL-60 cells, but also in uninduced HL-60 cells, the NALM-6, REH, RPMI-8392 and TALL-1 cell lines, and in human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), indicating that the transcriptional block producing it is constitutive. In HL-60 cells, the 0.38 kb RNA level increased on DMSO induction while the 2.3 kb c-myc mRNA was down-regulated. Upon DMSO removal, as the 2.3 kb mRNA was made again, the 0.38 kb RNA fell to preinduction levels, Thus, modulation of this constitutive block regulates the relative amounts of c-myc message available for translation in response to specific growth stimuli. This mechanism for c-myc gene regulation may be common within the hematologic system.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recently established nude mouse model carrying an ascitic tumor of NALM-6 human pre-B leukemia cells was used as the tumor model. A marked difference was observed in the in vivo antitumor efficacy between SN5d-RA and SN5-RA; SN5d-RA was much more effective than SN5-RA. Several experiments were carried out to gain information concerning the mechanisms involved in the different antitumor efficacy of the two immunotoxins. Although naked (unconjugated) mAb SN5d was much less effective than SN5d-RA conjugates in the in vivo tumor suppression, mAb SN5d was more effective than mAb SN5 in the in vivo tumor suppression. Additionally, marked differences were found between SN5d and SN5 in the induction of antigenic modulation and in the regulation of Ag biosynthesis and expression. Binding of SN5 to NALM-6 leukemia cells caused strong antigenic modulation (down-regulation of Ag expression) and strongly down-regulated Ag biosynthesis and cell surface expression of new Ag. In contrast, binding of SN5d to NALM-6 leukemia cells caused little modulation of overall cell surface expression of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ag; the decrease of old Ag by endocytosis after binding to mAb SN5d was compensated by newly exocytosed cell-surface expressed Ag. The present results appear to reveal a novel mechanism which regulates cytotoxic activities of antibodies and immunoconjugates.",,,,['CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

This increase in G2 + M, as detected by flow cytometry measurement of DNA content, may be due to an accumulation of cells, either in G2 or during the end of S phase; it may also be related to the existence of small tetraploid clones generally ignored by cytogeneticists. In order to identify possible subpopulations of cells with a DNA index greater than or equal to 2.0, we have compared the results of a cytogenetic analysis to the G2 + M values. We have also studied the distribution of S phase cells in 24 cases of ALL by incorporating 5-bromodeoxyuridine, labelling the cells by indirect immunofluorescence, and analysing them by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. The distribution of cells during S phase was quantified: no accumulation of cells was ever observed at the end of S phase.

Hypokalemia is caused by kalium loss from kidney and hypersecretion of mineral corticoid. Hypercalcemia is found in the high frequency among patients with malignant disease.

The excess calcium causes defective urinary concentration with polydipsia, nausea and vomiting leading to volume depletion. At serum calcium levels about 13.8 mg/dl, there may be rapid deterioration or renal function, dehydration, coma and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercalcemia is rarely the first manifestation of cancer. There are three principle pathogenic causes of malignant hypercalcemia, 1) hypercalcemia is a feature of several hematological cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, T cell leukemia, but most commonly with myeloma. The hypercalcemia in these myeloma patients is due to the secretion of an osteoclast activator, a lymphokine by the myeloma cells. 2) all patients with bony metastases have biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption. However, not all patients with bony metastases develop hypercalcemia. Probably the hypercalcemia is due partially to increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, mediated by a humoral factor, with activity similar to that of parathormone. 3) hypercalcemia in the patients without bony metastases is due to increased bone resorption caused by the ectopic secretion by the tumor. Mildly symptomatic patients will benefit from modest salt loading. They are dehydrated and replacement of the extracellular fluid is the first line of treatment. This may require 4-10 l normal saline/24 h. In addition, frusemide will increase calcium excretion. Calcitonin may be given subcutaneously or intravenously to refuse the mobilisation of calcium from bone. Glucocorticoids are unhelpful, but will prolong the effect of calcitonin. A diphosphonate is also useful.",,,,,,,,32,,,,

As cytokine production is regulated by T helper-inducer lymphocytes and might represent a parameter for functional integrity of immunocompetent cells, we have measured the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferons (IFN) by peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC) from 10 patients with hairy cell leukemia 11-24 months after end of therapy with DCF. The patients were in continuous remission at the time of study. Despite an absolute reduction in CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. there were no significant differences in IL-2 or TNF release between patients and controls. Except for a significant reduction in IFN-alpha release stimulated by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), IFN productions induced by other mitogens (phytohemagglutinin, PHA; Concanavalin A, ConA; pokeweed mitogen, PWM) and viral antigens were within normal range. There was also a decrease in proliferative responsiveness to PHA, but responses to ConA, PWM, and other viral antigens were normal. In five of the patients, we have monitored closely the changes in IL-2, TNF, and IFN before, during, and after treatment and could demonstrate a rapid normalization of initially decreased IL-2 release in all cases and also of TNF if the initial production was reduced. This study shows that, even though the absolute number of T lymphocytes and helper cells are reduced in the long-term observation after DCF treatment, the capacity to produce IL-2, TNF, and IFN-gamma was within normal range. Parallel to this observation, no opportunistic infections or frequency of infectious complications occurred in these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-3 and GM-CSF had a similar stimulating activity on AML-CFU growth. G-CSF resulted the most efficient stimulus for colony formation and was additive or synergistic with IL-3 and GM-CSF, M-CSF, used alone, had a negligible stimulating activity. When CD34+ cells were used, IL-1 by itself had a low stimulating activity and displayed little or no synergy with IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. On the contrary, when unfractionated cells were used, IL-1 was very effective in inducing AML-CFU formation and was markedly synergistic with IL-3 and GM-CSF. These results show that IL-1-induced leukemic colony formation is prevalently mediated by accessory cells. IL-6 supported AML-CFU growth in seven of 10 cases, thus showing a direct effect on CD34+ leukemic cells, and enhanced the growth of IL-3-(+47 to +167%) and GM-CSF-dependent (+60 to +110%) AML-CFU. Recloning studies of single colonies demonstrated that primary CD34+ AML-CFU, stimulated by IL-3 and GM-CSF, generated secondary and tertiary colonies, whereas primary AML-CFU stimulated by G-CSF and IL-6 failed to give rise to secondary colonies, thus indicating a complete suppression of self-renewal. Sequential recloning of colonies grown in the presence of IL-3 + IL-6 demonstrated that addition of IL-6 and IL-3-containing plates resulted in a nearly complete suppression of self-renewal. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the heterogeneity of the CD34+ leukemic cell fraction and indicate the existence of complex regulatory events at the level of CD34+ leukemic cells. Data obtained from recloning experiments are of therapeutic interest in view of the clinical application of HGFs in the treatment of myeloid leukemias.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about these changes in fetal BM B cells. In order to compare fetal with adult B cell development, we performed three-color, flow cytometric analyses of cell surface antigens, as well as nuclear TdT staining, on lymphoid cells from fetal BM. Mononuclear cells isolated from fetal BM (18-22 weeks) were stained with combinations of antibodies against CD3, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD34, CD45, PCA-1, IgM, and HLA-DR. Analysis of six separate fetal BM specimens indicated that combinations of cell surface antigens were expressed on analogous populations in fetal and adult BM. Consistent with adult BM, greater than 95% of TdT+ cells within the CD10+ population were CD34+, whereas less than 5% were CD34-. This CD10+/CD34+/TdT+ population constituted 30-40% of the total B cell compartment, compared with 10% in adults. Quantitative changes in CD45 expression on fetal BM B cells defined three clear populations, as has been observed in adults. In striking contrast to adult BM, greater than 95% of CD19+ and greater than 95% of surface IgM+ cells were CD10+, indicating that CD10 is a pan-B cell antigen in fetal BM. Virtually no mature B cells expressing CD21, CD22, or PCA-1 were detected in fetal BM. Our results indicate a preponderance of immature phenotypes exist in the fetal BM B cell compartment. These immature cells can be grouped into three distinct populations, and probably correspond to expanded populations found less frequently in adult BM. This striking increase in the earliest identifiable stages of B cell ontogeny is consistent with an active expansion of cells destined to constitute the humoral immune system during fetal development.",,,,"['P01 CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Toxicity has been relatively mild unless very high doses are administered. Randomised controlled trials are in progress and will help to define the exact role of growth factors in this setting. Future prospects include the increasing availability of other growth factors for clinical use and the potential for combination growth factor therapy to provide a more optimal haemopoietic response.","['0145-2126(90)90102-F [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90102-f [doi]']",,,,,,,62,,,,

MAb YB5.B8 significantly reduced the yield of colonies of all types examined (granulocyte-macrophage, granulocyte, macrophage and eosinophil) in response to GM-CSF but not to IL-3 or G-CSF. However, MAb YB5.B8 failed to influence the proliferation of the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line RC-2A in response to GM-CSF, G-CSF or IL-3. Direct binding studies demonstrated the presence of low numbers of receptors for GM-CSF on RC-2A cells, however, the binding of this cytokine was not influenced by co- and/or pre-incubation with MAb YB5.B8. Therefore the antigen identified by YB5.B8 is probably not a receptor for GM-CSF and may indirectly influence the response of normal haemopoietic progenitors to this cytokine.","['0145-2126(90)90019-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90019-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The assay system involved the use of an end-labeled DNA primer so as to allow the quantitation of elongation on a donor template relative to the amount of elongation achieved by template switching (by means of sequence homology) when an acceptor template RNA was added. We examined several variables that affected the efficiency of the reaction: (i) the reaction time, (ii) the relative amounts of acceptor and donor template, (iii) the extent of sequence overlap between the donor and acceptor templates, and (iv) the presence or absence of RNase H activity associated with the reverse transcriptase. The basic reaction, with RNA templates and normal reverse transcriptase, yielded as much as 83% template switching. In the absence of RNase H, switching still occurred but the efficiency was lowered. Also, when the donor template was changed from RNA to DNA, there was still switching; not surprisingly, this was largely unaffected by the presence or absence of RNase H. Finally, we examined the action of the RNase H on RNA templates after primary transcription but prior to template switching. We found that in most cases, both ends of the original RNA template were able to maintain an association with the DNA product. This result was consistent with the work of others who have shown that RNase H acts as an endonuclease.",['10.1128/JVI.64.9.4321-4328.1990 [doi]'],PMC247899,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

These mutations led to the substitution of a histidine for Tyr-590 and a glycine for Lys-536. Both changes gave rise to strains that were temperature dependent for transformation of both NIH 3T3 cells and lymphoid cells when expressed in the context of a truncated Abelson protein. In the context of the prototype P120 v-abl protein, the Gly-536 substitution generated a host range mutant that induced conditional transformation in lymphoid cells but had only a subtle effect on NIH 3T3 cells. The combination of both substitutions gave rise to a P120 strain that was temperature sensitive for both NIH 3T3 and lymphoid cell transformation. The Abelson proteins encoded by the temperature-sensitive strain displayed in vitro kinase activities that were reduced when compared with those of wild-type proteins. In vivo, levels of phosphotyrosine were reduced only at the restrictive temperature. Analysis of cells expressing either the wild-type P160 v-abl protein or the P210 bcr/abl protein and an Abelson protein encoded by a temperature-sensitive strain failed to correct this defect, suggesting either that tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo is an intramolecular reaction or that the protein encoded by the temperature-sensitive strain is a poor substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo.

Binding stoichiometry revealed that approximately 3 mol of OAPA bound per mole of enzyme, when complete enzyme activation occurred. However, in the presence of template-primer, OAPA does not abolish polymerase activity and 2 mol of OAPA remains bound to 1 mol of enzyme. This observation suggests that only one OAPA reactive site is responsible for the loss of polymerase activity. This site was located on a single tryptic peptide by comparing the maps of the native enzyme and the enzyme treated with OAPA in the presence and absence of template-primer. The appearance of a new peptide peak eluting at 125 min from a C-18 reverse-phase column was consistently noted in the tryptic digest of enzyme treated with OAPA. This peak was absent in tryptic peptides made from the control enzyme or the enzyme protein that was treated with OAPA in the presence of activated DNA or synthetic template-primers. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of this peptide revealed that it spanned residues 312-342 in the primary amino acid sequence of MuLV RT. Since this peptide does not contain arginine residues and Lys-329 exhibited resistance to tryptic digestion, we conclude that Lys-329 is the target of OAPA action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['10.1021/bi00474a006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although remission induction rates were not significantly different between patients with CD34+ and CD34-ALL (P = .23), event-free survival was shorter for patients with CD34- leukemia (P = .0014). Even though CD34 expression was associated with certain other known prognostically favorable variables including hyperdiploidy and lack of cytoplasmic Ig, it had an independent favorable effect on treatment outcome, even after adjusting for competing prognostic factors.",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.8.1389 [doi]'],,,"['CA 15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

More recently, homologous but non-identical spectrins (fodrins) were also found in various non-erythroid tissues. Spectrin mRNA in erythroid and various non-erythroid cells was examined by direct hybridization with human alpha-spectrin, beta-spectrin (erythroid spectrins), and alpha-fodrin (non-erythroid spectrin) cDNA probes. Northern blot analysis of poly (A)+ RNA revealed a distinct pattern of expression in erythroid vs. non-erythroid cells. Erythroid cells from early erythroblasts to reticulocyte stage expressed two mRNA species of beta-spectrin, whereas they expressed only a single species of alpha-spectrin, and no alpha-fodrin mRNA. In contrast, non-erythroid cells (platelets, myeloid cells, liver, muscle, heart, cerebellum, and eye lens) expressed either no alpha-spectrin mRNA or a different molecular weight transcript(s) of this gene, and a single species of alpha-fodrin mRNA. Additionally, they also expressed from none to multiple species of beta-spectrin, and these were of different molecular size(s) from that found in erythroid cells (with the exception of platelets). Transcripts of non-erythroid spectrin, alpha-fodrin, were found as a single copy only in non-erythroid tissues. Human and murine erythroleukemia cells expressed both erythroid spectrin transcripts in addition to alpha-fodrin and raise the possibility that erythroid progenitors may have the potential to express both erythroid and non-erythroid species. These data indicated that several mRNA species of beta-spectrin could be detected in both erythroid and some non-erythroid cells. Whether multiple spectrin peptides could also be found with functional heterogeneity is unclear.

As in the murine system, B cells predominate over other cell types, and all differentiation stages from pre-B to plasma cell are observed. Although these human long-term cultures pass through stages resembling phases I to III of murine Whitlock/Witte cultures, no outgrowth of nonadherent cells was seen after cultures had reached the ""crisis"" phase unless Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformants appeared. The stromal cells persisted well beyond crisis, but they could not be maintained and passaged as cell lines, limiting their use in molecular analysis. Transfection of these stromal cells with plasmid DNA containing the simian virus 40 (SV40) early region yielded 124 cloned cell lines. Analysis of these lines showed that all expressed SV40 large T antigen, but they retained most phenotypic markers found on non-transformed stromal cells. When adherent and T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells were cultured on either nontransformed stromal layers or transformed cell lines they proliferated actively and soon yielded predominantly lymphoid nonadherent populations. Moreover, prolonged survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells of pre-B phenotype was regularly achieved on both normal and transformed adherent cell layers. Although the liquid culture system favored lymphocytes, transformed stroma supported colony formation by both human and murine hemopoietic progenitors when marrow was added in agar medium. This was not explained by colony-stimulating factor (CSF) production, because striking heterogeneity in the levels of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) secretion by the lines was noted. Some lines that did not produce detectable CSF demonstrated good support of fresh bone marrow growth and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell survival. The heterogeneity of these cell lines and their capacity to support hemopoiesis suggest that they will be useful in studying the molecular basis of in vitro lymphohemopoiesis in man.",,,,,,,,,,,,

One promising strategy involves the recruitment of leukemic cells into the cell cycle by hematopoietic growth factors in combination with cycle-specific cytotoxic drugs. Because cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), which targets only cells in S-phase of the mitotic cell cycle, is included in most chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, we explored the hypothesis that the recruitment of quiescent immature leukemic blasts into the cell cycle by the early acting growth factor interleukin 3 (IL-3) can increase the efficacy of Ara-C for kill of leukemic stem cells. We show that IL-3 increases the fraction of blasts in S-phase, as assessed by DNA histogram analysis with propidium iodide staining, leading to an enhancement of kill of clonogenic blast cells when combined with Ara-C. Expression of the protooncogenes c-myc, c-fms, and c-fos, known to be linked to cellular proliferation and differentiation, was also altered by IL-3 in Ara-C-treated cultures, further substantiating the role that IL-3 plays as an enhancer of the cytotoxicity of Ara-C.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent growth of normal and chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow CFU-GM was greatly enhanced by TNF-alpha at doses of 0.1 to 100 units/ml. Growth enhancement included neutrophil, eosinophil, and monocyte-macrophage colonies and clusters at 7 and 14 days of culture. Since similar results were achieved with highly enriched progenitor cell populations, devoid of accessory cells, an indirect effect on CFU-GM growth through the release by accessory cells of other cytokines upon TNF-alpha stimulation was thus ruled out. By contrast, the same doses of TNF-alpha inhibited the growth of normal CFU-GM in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-dependent cultures. Taken together, our findings indicate that the final effect of TNF-alpha on normal bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitor growth is dependent on the specific growth factor interacting with it, and that both normal and chronic myeloid leukemia CFU-GM are equally responsive to the combined effects of TNF-alpha and a given colony-stimulating factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis showed that in MT4 cell line, which expresses a low level of viral RNA and proteins, not only are the HTLV-I proviruses heavily methylated but methylation also involves large regions around and within the long terminal repeats.

In this study the human myelomonoblast line THP-1 has been used to study monocytic differentiation in response to various cytokines and the phorbolester TPA. After treatment of THP-1 cells with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL-6) and TPA the cells became adherent, lost their division potential and expressed new surface structures associated with monocytic differentiation. The expression of c-fos and c-fms transcripts was rapidly induced within 45 min by these agents and declined to undectable levels within 24 h. Exposure of THP-1 to TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TPA was associated with a rapid downregulation of c-myc expression, that returned to starting levels within 36 h. However, treatment of THP-1 with other cytokines including Granulocyte (G)-, Macrophage (M)-, Granulocyte/Macrophage (GM)-Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF), Interleukin (IL)-3 and Interleukin (IL)-4 failed to result in monocytic differentiation.

To determine the mechanism(s) by which down-regulation of human c-myb protein (MYB) synthesis interferes with DNA synthesis, we analyzed mRNA levels of DNA polymerase alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transcripts of two genes required for DNA synthesis, in normal and leukemic T lymphocytes exposed to MYB antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Expression of DNA polymerase alpha was inhibited both in normal T lymphocytes progressing from G0 to S phase and in exponentially growing CCRF-CEM leukemic cells, whereas expression of PCNA was inhibited only in mitogen-stimulated PBMC and remained essentially unaffected in the leukemia T-cell line. The functional link between expression of MYB and DNA polymerase alpha mRNAs was further demonstrated by analyzing DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels in a temperature-sensitive (ts) fibroblast cell line (TK-ts13; TK is thymidine kinase) constitutively expressing human MYB mRNA driven by the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. In the MYB-expressing TK-ts13 cells, DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels were unaffected following shift to the nonpermissive temperature of 39.6 degrees C, whereas in the parental line, DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels were readily down-regulated. These findings indicate that the expression of MYB is related to that of DNA polymerase alpha in cells expressing MYB at high levels and suggest that there is a functional link between c-myb and DNA polymerase alpha mRNA expression during cell cycle progression of normal T lymphocytes.",['10.1073/pnas.87.15.5963 [doi]'],PMC54450,,"['CA 09485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Using the mRNA molecules as templates, copy DNA (cDNA) molecules encoding the RT or tat-specific immunoglobulins, are prepared and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. After engineering of the antibody encoding cDNAs to provide appropriate intracellular addressing information, the cDNAs would be used to transfect stem cells of HIV infected individuals in vitro. The presence, in the cytoplasm and nucleus, of antibodies which had been selected to interfere with the reproduction of the virus, would protect these cells from infection. Autologous transplantation of such cells would confer resistance against HIV replication by these stem cells and their progeny in the treated individual. Such a strategy may also be useful against other retroviruses and could provide resistance against retrovirally triggered leukemia.","['0306-9877(90)90027-C [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(90)90027-c [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Actin assembly, studied using 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-phallacidin, was similarly stimulated by vanadate, though considerably higher concentrations were required to observe this effect. In contrast with these responses, the secretion of lysozyme was not stimulated by vanadate, nor did vanadate affect calcium-induced secretion.

Prolonged suppression or elimination of the leukemic cell clone by interferon may ultimately increase survival of patients with CML. Interferon is not effective single-agent therapy for multiple myeloma, but improves response rate when combined with conventional agents. AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrates a 40 percent objective response rate to interferon, with less risk of immune system suppression than conventional cytotoxics.

Detailed analysis of data pooled from 405 patients demonstrated that the 3-year probability of relapse was 48% for recipients of T-cell-depleted bone marrow, but only 9% for recipients of non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow (relative risk, 5.4; P less than .0001). Regardless of transplant T-cell status, however, patients who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were less likely to relapse at 4 years when compared with recipients without chronic GVHD (6% v 24%; relative risk, 3.1; P less than .01). Survival was correlated with severity of acute GVHD and age. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from unrelated donors can be useful in expanding the patient population eligible for transplantation. A study of recipients of transplants from unrelated donors showed a 3-year projected survival of 55% for chronic phase patients, and 22% for patients with advanced disease. However, a high rate of graft failure (10%) and grade II to IV acute GVHD can be expected. Preliminary data suggest that ex vivo treatment of autologous bone marrow with interferon can effect complete or partial Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome negative bone marrow mosaicism, although appearance of Ph chromosome negative metaphases may not be persistent. Thus, interferon treatment of autologous bone marrow may play a more significant role in the treatment of CML.",,,,,,,,33,,,,

Prognostic factors were analyzed using a standard prognostic model. From a univariate analysis of patients with nonblastic Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, percentage of blasts and promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and LDH activity were shown to be factors with a significant negative influence on survival. However, age and the platelet count did not influence survival. The standard prognostic model, generated with the 4 variables (1) percentage of blasts and promyelocytes, (2) spleen size, (3) platelet count and (4) age did not provide a useful representation of risk status in this heterogenous patient population. However, the addition of further variables (LDH, additional chromosomal aberrations, percentage of basophiles/eosinophiles and percentage of bone marrow blasts) to the standard model allowed a separation into 2 patient groups: one with low and the other with intermediate to high risk. Our data support the general validity of the prognostic model; however, the applicability of the model may be compromised in hematologic centers with a heterogenous CML population due to the selection of high-risk patients.

Also, culture cells from megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, MEG-01, and human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, showed a different pattern of expression for the CD36 antigen molecule detected by 5F1 and OKM5 MoAb, individually.

We investigated by means of an indirect enzyme-immunoassay the expression of ""early"" and ""late"" differentiation markers on bone marrow cell suspensions, as well as on agar clones in 18 cases of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as compared with 13 normal controls. Uncultured AML cells carried only low amounts of ""late"" myeloid differentiation antigen (CD15) but expressed nearly normal levels when cultured in agar with colony-stimulating factor (CSF). In contrast to normal bone marrow, AML cells were strongly reactive with ""early"" differentiation markers (CD10, CD20, CD34) and remained so during culture. Normal and leukemic agar clones could be specifically distinguished by CD20- and CD34 antibodies. By means of a double marker technique, it could be shown that ""late"" myeloid differentiation markers (CD15) and ""early"" markers (CD10, CD20, CD34) were coexpressed on the same cells only in AML but not in normal bone marrow. Leukemic clones were identified by phenotyping of agar clones in 17 of 19 cases investigated during complete clinical remission (CR) of the disease. A formal proof of the leukemic origin of CD20/CD34 positive clones grown in CR was made possible in four cases either by Southern blot analysis or by a cytogenetic marker. These results demonstrate that AML cells can partially differentiate in vitro in the presence of CSF. A distinction of AML from normal clones, however, is possible by their reactivity with ""early"" differentiation markers, because this is maintained under the differentiating influence of CSF. The technique described here identifies residual leukemic clones in the majority of AML in CR, which persist at a constant rate and increase 6 months before cytological relapse.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the reaction conditions employed, any one of these flavonoids almost completely inhibited the activity of RLV reverse transcriptase at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml. HIV reverse transcriptase was inhibited by 100%, 100%, 90% and 70% in the presence of 2 micrograms/ml quercetin, myricetin, quercetagetin and baicalein, respectively. The mode of inhibition of these flavonoids was competitive (RLV reverse transcriptase) or partially competitive (HIV reverse transcriptase) with respect to the template.primer complex, (rA)n.(dT), and noncompetitive with respect to the triphosphate substrate, dTTP. The Ki values for RLV reverse transcriptase were found to be 0.37 microM and 0.08 microM for baicalein and quercetin, respectively and those for HIV reverse transcriptase were 2.52 microM, 0.52 microM, 0.46 microM and 0.08 microM for baicalein, quercetin, quercetagetin and myricetin, respectively. Comparative studies with other flavonoids (hydroxyflavones, dihydroxyflavones and polyhydroxyflavones and flavanones) carried out to clarify the structure/activity relationships, revealed that the presence of both the unsaturated double bond between positions 2 and 3 of the flavonoid pyrone ring, and the three hydroxyl groups introduced on positions 5, 6 and 7, (i.e. baicalein) were a prerequisite for the inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity. Removal of the 6-hydroxyl group of baicalein required the introduction of three additional hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 3' and 4' (quercetin), to afford a compound still capable of inhibiting the reverse transcriptase activity. Quercetagetin which contains the structures of both baicalein and quercetin, and myricetin which has the structure of quercetin with an additional hydroxyl group on the 5' position also proved strong inhibitors of reverse transcriptase activity. The inhibition by baicalein of reverse transcriptase is highly specific, whereas quercetin and quercetagetin were also strong inhibitors of DNA polymerase beta and DNA polymerase I, respectively.

In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in signaling by the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI). Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) led to the phosphorylation of several proteins on tyrosine, the most prominent having a mass of 72 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation was rapid, detectable 1 min after stimulation, and correlated with both the time course and antigen dose for histamine release. Reversal of Fc epsilon RI cross-linking prevented continuation of the degranulation process and resulted in rapid loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. The receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation was still induced in the absence of calcium in the medium. Depletion of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not dramatically affect the tyrosine phosphorylation signal or the release of histamine. In contrast, the calcium ionophore A23187 induced histamine release in the absence of a perceptible increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal following Fc epsilon RI aggregation, independent of the exocytotic process itself. Taken together, our findings functionally link protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues to Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction leading to histamine release.",['10.1073/pnas.87.14.5327 [doi]'],PMC54316,,,,,,,,,,

The selective enrichment of CML A-LAK cells depended on their propensity to adhere to plastic and to proliferate when cultured in the presence of rIL-2 for 14 days. In both CP and AD patients, 14-day culture resulted in growth of a uniform population of large granular lymphocytes. While less than 10% of the A-LAK cells were CD56-/CD3+ (mature T lymphocytes), 82% +/- 12% of A-LAK cells from early CP patients (diagnosed less than 1 year from study), 84% +/- 3% of A-LAK cells from late CP patients (studied greater than 1 year after diagnosis), and 87% +/- 3% of A-LAK cells from AD patients were CD56+/CD3- (activated natural killer [NK] cells). No bcr gene rearrangement could be found in A-LAK cells from 13 CP and six AD CML patients studied. A-LAK cells from seven early CP CML patients displayed similar cytotoxicity against K562 (80% +/- 7% lysis at effector:target ratio of 20:1) and against Raji (80% +/- 12% lysis) compared with A-LAK from 17 normal individuals (72% +/- 3% K562 lysis, P = .21; 74% +/- 5% Raji lysis, P = .39).

The ability of GM-CSF to support progenitor growth was inferior to that of IL-3, and the cells were virtually unresponsive when cultured with G-CSF, supporting the notion that these blood-derived progenitors belong to a primitive population of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The results obtained in simultaneous methycellulose cultures (MC) showed the same trend and provided additional information on the ability of GM-CSF and IL-3 to support erythroid progenitor growth. The combination of IL-3 plus G-CSF, but not IL-3 plus GM-CSF, resulted in a synergistic increase in colony number.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IL-1 induces autocrine granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, and these factors may then synergistically induce proliferation in AML blast cells. In this report, we show that IL-1 stimulates DNA synthesis of highly enriched normal bone marrow blast cells (CD34 positive, adherent cell depleted, CD3/CD14/CD15 negative). The stimulative effect of IL-1 can be blocked with neutralizing anti-TNF alpha and anti-GM-CSF antibodies and, most efficiently, by the combination of anti-TNF alpha and anti-GM-CSF, but not with anti-G-CSF antibody, suggesting that IL-1-induced proliferation was initiated through TNF and GM-CSF release. Concentrations of TNF and GM-CSF increased in the culture medium of normal bone marrow blast cells after IL-1 induction. Of the IL-1-induced cells, 12% were positive for GM-CSF mRNA by in situ hybridization, as opposed to 6% of non-induced cells. Thus, in addition to its effect on leukemic blast cells, IL-1 also acts on normal marrow blast cells. We propose a scheme where IL-1 stimulation of normal bone marrow blast cells leads to the induction of TNF alpha and GM-CSF, which in association stimulate DNA synthesis efficiently according to a paracrine or autocrine mechanism within the marrow blast cell compartment.",['S0006-4971(20)82475-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In three cases successfully studied following 0-2 days of culture, metaphase spreads with abnormal karyotypes characteristic of the patients' leukemic clones were seen in five of five, six of nine, and four of four PAS-positive cells successfully studied.

Abnormal karyotypes were seen in five of five and two of two metaphases in PAS-positive cells successfully studied in two patients.

Recent reports described a very strong association between TdT expression and rearrangements of IgH and TcR genes in such AML specimens, suggesting a predominant lymphoid commitment of these TdT positive AML blasts. When submitting 24 serologically and morphologically well-characterized TdT positive AML specimens for additional genotypic analysis to determine the IgH and TcR gene configuration, we observed that only four had clonally rearranged IgH and/or TcR genes, whereas 20 had germ line configuration. This frequency is clearly lower than previously reported and not necessarily different from rearrangement frequencies reported for TdT negative AML (4-40%).

The kinetics of GCT-CM-induced colony formation were comparable to that of G-CSF-induced colony growth, both in MDS and in normal bone marrow cultures. Colony formation was found to be delayed in MDS. The delay in colony formation was most apparent in the GCT-CM (G-CSF) responsive progenitor cell compartment. In MDS cases with clinical features of high risk disease, this delay was more pronounced as compared with low risk cases (7 and 3 days, respectively, in response to GCT-CM). The delay in colony formation was found to be caused by an increase in the time interval before progenitor cells had begun to divide. These results suggest that a prolongation of the time spent in G0 of myeloid progenitor cells in MDS may be the cause of the indolent in vitro colony formation observed in this disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was observed even when the N3dTTP concentration was 0.3 microM, 100-fold less than dTTP. Studies with reverse transcriptases from avian myeloblastosis virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus showed that N3dTTP was also efficiently incorporated into DNA by these enzymes and terminated DNA strand elongation.

It is hypothesized that extracellular ATP derived from platelet storage granules and damaged endothelium at sites of localized tissue damage or infection may potentiate the pro-inflammatory effects of phagocytic cells in vivo. ATP-dependent functional responses in the phagocyte appear to be due to stimulation of putative P2 purinoreceptors that are coupled to the activation of a phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The existence in nature of at least four subtypes of P2 purinoreceptors has been proposed based on the rank order of potency of nucleotide analogs of ATP studied in a variety of cell types. However, no studies involving the structural identification and characterization of the putative receptors have been reported. We have used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to demonstrate acquired adenosine 5'-(thio) triphosphate (ATP gamma S) responsiveness in oocytes injected with mRNA from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 by measuring the accelerated efflux of intracellular calcium. Two peaks of ATP gamma S responsiveness (Peak I and Peak II) were detected in sucrose gradient fractionated RNA that corresponded to transcript sizes of 4 and 6 kilobases and that were distinct from a third peak previously shown to be enriched in formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor activity. Peak I and Peak II RNA endowed receptor activity in the oocyte that was pharmacologically indistinguishable: ADP and AMP were inactive whereas UTP and ITP exhibited activity that was similar in potency to that of ATP gamma S. Both Peak I and Peak II ATP gamma S-dependent activity was inhibited by pertussis toxin. These data strongly support the concept of phagocytic cell receptors for extracellular nucleotide triphosphates whose ligand specificity is distinct from all other previously described P2 purinoreceptor subtypes, with the exception of the P2 receptor described in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, by virtue of the ineffectiveness of ADP as a stimulus. These receptors are most likely composed of a single polypeptide chain that can be expressed in the Xenopus oocyte in a functional form regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein.",['S0021-9258(19)38442-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of Leu 19+ (NKH-1, CD56) and the lytic activity of a purified Leu 19+ population from the peripheral blood of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia as well as from healthy children were determined. This cell population mediates most natural killer and natural killer-like activity in the peripheral blood. Twenty-three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (16 at diagnosis, seven in relapse) as well as six control children were studied. The percentage of Leu 19+ cells was significantly lower in the blood of children either at initial diagnosis (median, 3%; P less than 0.005) or in relapse (median, 1%; P less than 0.01) than that for the control children (median, 12.5%). The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against K562 in 3-hour 51Cr release assay was significantly lower for patients either at diagnosis (median, 8.5 lytic units[LU]/10(7) cells; P less than 0.005) or in relapse (median, 3 LU/10(7) cells; P less than 0.005) than that for normal controls (median, 97 LU/10(7) cells). The lytic activity of a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) purified Leu 19+ population was evaluated. The Leu 19+ cells were sorted from PBMC of 11 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia who had more than 2% Leu 19+ cells in their PBMC (nine at diagnosis and two in relapse). The lytic activity of sorted Leu 19+ cells was significantly (P less than 0.04) lower for patients at initial diagnosis (median, 45 LU/10(7) cells) than that for normal control children (median, 317 LU/10(7) cells). One of the two children studied at relapse had low Leu 19+ lytic activity. The authors concluded that (1) The percentage of Leu 19+ cells in the peripheral blood of the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia either at diagnosis or in relapse is below normal; (2) The lytic activity of PBMC from the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia is reduced both at diagnosis and in relapse; and (3) The lytic activity of Leu 19+ purified PBMC is reduced in the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.

In this report we describe the features of B-cell leukemias with CD11c+CD5+ immunophenotypes and the identification of novel circulating B-cell subsets defined by the expression of CD20, CD5, and CD11c antigens. Morphologic evaluation of 14CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias showed that they generally had larger cellular diameters (14 to 21 microns) and lower nuclear:cytoplasm ratios than typical small lymphocyte CLL. These cases did not exhibit the well-defined nucleoli characteristic of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). The presenting clinical features of CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias were most consistent with CLL or PLL, and none of the evaluated cases had pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and cytoplasmic villi characteristic of HCL. Examination of normal peripheral blood (n = 6) by three-color flow cytometry identified four novel B-cell subsets with the following immunophenotypes (mean percent of total CD20+ B cells +/- SE): CD20+CD5+CD11c+ (8.0 +/- 1.6); CD20+CD5-CD11c+ (12.0 +/- 2.0); CD20+CD5+CD11c- (35.0 +/- 4.9); and CD20+CD5-CD11c- (44.0 +/- 5.0). Our findings suggest that CD11c+CD5+ B-cell leukemias with atypical morphologic features represent forms of CLL or PLL rather than HCL.

Interferon has already been used in the therapy of hairy cell leukaemia, Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS(SIDA) and metastasis of malignant melanoma. Interleukin 2 allows for an increase in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells in producing LAK cells, the lymphocyte infiltrating the tumour (TIL). Therapeutic combinations combining IL2 associated with LAK or of TIL have been evaluated in some private studies. These treatments have shown some interesting response levels on those tumours which are usually resistant, such as malignant melanoma or carcinoma of the kidney. TNF is active in vitro on human tumours; its potential toxicity is important; it is the object of a phase 1 clinical trial.

The mean quantity of MCP was 3000 to 7000 copies/cell in normal blood cells, except for E which have no MCP. Of note, PMN did not fully reveal all MCP sites until incubated for greater than 30 min at 37 degrees C. In most tumor cell lines, except for B cell lineages, expression of MCP increased by 2- to 8-fold in comparison with the normal cell counterparts. Strikingly, recombinant granulocyte CSF treatment of myeloid cell lines and hemin treatment of an erythroblastoid cell line, K562, led to a decrease of MCP to near normal levels. In contrast, C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) tended to increase with granulocyte-CSF treatment in several cell lines. We simultaneously determined levels of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CR1 in these tumor cells, and tested susceptibility to C3 deposition via activation of the alternative C pathway. Of 21 cell lines we examined, 14 lacked CR1 and two lacked DAF; none, however, lacked MCP. A slight amount of C3 deposition was observed in some myeloid cell lines and EBV-infected B cell lines. However, C3 deposition did not reflect a defect in the regulatory proteins. Tumor cells bearing MCP, lacking CR1 or DAF, and undergoing no C3 deposition, may escape C attack due to the compensatory effect of MCP in the absence of the other regulatory proteins. High expression of MCP provides a convenient means for tumor cells to block C attack and survive in blood stream. We favor the interpretation that MCP is up-regulated in association with certain malignant disorders, and that cell differentiation results in a switch from an MCP-dominant state to a CR1-dominant state.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the mechanism whereby FAD104 exhibits good antitumor activity in vivo was studied through experiments in vitro in comparison with doxorubicin (DOX). FAD104 had weaker activity than DOX in DNA single and double strand scission in P388 cells and in binding to calf thymus DNA. FAD104 was taken up by P388 cells faster than DOX. The ester linkage in FAD104 was gradually hydrolyzed at neutral pH. FAD104 was metabolized to 7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone (FT-ADM) when incubated with mouse or human serum. In mouse serum the esterase activity was about 100 times higher than in human serum. The product of nonenzymatic and enzymatic esterolysis, FT-ADM, was rapidly taken up by P388 cells and accumulated, reaching at a 9.7-fold higher level than DOX. Thus FAD104 was less active than DOX in itself, but it showed much higher activity through conversion into FT-ADM, due to the action of esterase or to spontaneous and gradual hydrolysis at physiological pH. 7-O-(2,6-Dideoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinol (FT-ADM-OH), another metabolite found in mouse serum had the least biological activity among the fluorine-containing anthracycline glycosides, but its activity was still higher than DOX.",['10.7164/antibiotics.43.556 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These factors were recognized antigenically by certain antibodies directed against epitopes of p15E, a transmembrane protein of murine leukemia virus which shares regions of identity with proteins deduced from human endogenous retroviral envelope transcripts as well as HIV. These reagents precipitated a single-chain, nonglycosylated, nonviral protein of molecular weight 57,000 Da from SSF-producing cells. There was no cross-reactivity with antisera recognizing the IL-2R alpha-chain (CD25) or tumor necrosis factor.

We have shown that frequent rearrangements of the p53 gene cause loss of expression or synthesis of truncated proteins, whereas overexpression of p53 protein is seen in other Friend cell lines. We now demonstrate that p53 expression in the latter cells is also abnormal, as a result of missense mutations in regions encoding highly conserved amino acids.

It was previously shown that these cells undergo striking morphological changes after IgE-mediated secretion. The present study was undertaken to examine if the morphological changes were dependent on activation of the Fc epsilon receptor. Therefore, the cells were stimulated to release histamine by two different mechanisms: activation of the Fc epsilon receptor by antigen and treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. Cell surface and cytoskeletal changes were examined by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy after either IgE- or ionophore-mediated histamine release. After exposure of the cells to either secretagogue, the cells spread over the surface of the culture dish and underwent rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed that deep ruffles developed on the surface of the cells undergoing IgE-mediated release. The surface changes were not as pronounced with the ionophore. The distribution of the cytoskeletal elements was examined by immunofluorescence using FITC-phalloidin and antibodies against vimentin and tubulin. In unstimulated cells actin was localized at the cell periphery, just under the plasma membrane. In the stimulated cells it was associated with the cell periphery and concentrated in the surface ruffles. As the stimulated cells spread, intermediate filaments and microtubules became distributed throughout the cell body, but there was no obvious association with the membrane ruffles. These morphological changes were dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and on the concentration of ionophore or antigen, and were also correlated with the amount of histamine released. Additionally, IgE-mediated stimulation led to increased uptake of the soluble-phase tracer Lucifer yellow, whereas stimulation with the ionophore A23187 showed no increase in Lucifer yellow internalization. Ionophore A23187 produced changes similar but not identical to those seen in the RBL-2H3 cells after IgE-mediated histamine release. The differences may be owing to the involvement of the Fc epsilon receptor in IgE-mediated secretion.",['10.1177/38.7.1693935 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using the patch clamp technique in the whole cell configuration, we measured the conductance increase induced by perforin in susceptible cell lines as well as in resistant CTL lines (CTLLs). The results showed that although the amplitudes of the first observed conductance steps produced in both cell types were comparable, CTLLs required at least 10-fold higher doses of perforin to form membrane pores. Outside-out patches excised from CTLL-R8, on the other hand, appeared to be more susceptible to channel formation by perforin than intact cells, as lower doses were able to induce conductance increases. Once channels were induced in CTL membranes, however, their conductances (greater than 1 nS) were indistinguishable from the ones obtained in susceptible cell lines. Fluorescence measurements with quin-2 showed that perforin induced rapid increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in susceptible EL4 cells. In marked contrast, a perforin dose 60-120-fold higher than the minimal dose required to elicit Ca2+ changes in EL4 cells was not able to induce any measurable Ca2+ increase in CTLL-R8. The data suggest that the resistance of CTLs to lysis mediated by their own mediator perforin is at least in part due to their ability to avoid pore formation by this protein. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not yet understood, but the observation that outside-out patches excised from CTLL-R8 are more susceptible to channel formation by perforin than intact cells raises the possibility that an intracellular mechanism may be involved.",['10.1083/jcb.110.6.2109 [doi]'],PMC2116140,,"['AI-24755/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-17803/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

(1) The blast cells of all the cases reacted with from at least two to at most eight different antibodies. Each antibody reacted with blast cells in a minimum of two (maximum 30) cases. (2) MT1, Ki-B3, anti-alpha 1-antichymotrypsin anti-neutrophil elastase, anti-S-100 protein, and MAC387 stained blast cells in more than 50% of the cases; MB1, L26, UCHL1, 4KB5, and DAKO-M1 in 20% to 50% of the cases; and anti-Leu-7 and anti-factor VIII-related antigen in less than 20% of the cases. (3) In the majority of cases many T lymphocytes, a small-to-moderate number of B lymphocytes, and a few Leu-7-positive lymphoid cells were intermingled with the blast cells. In some cases, especially where only a minor proportion of the blast cells was immunostained, it was nearly impossible to distinguish the lymphocytes of the tumor's stromal reaction from small blast cells. Thus, AML exhibits a heterogeneous immunophenotype in trephine biopsy specimens. Immunohistologic diagnosis of this disease in such specimens may be extremely difficult. Since staining of the blast cells with one or more of the antibodies generally used to define B cells, T cells, or their neoplastic derivatives is not uncommon, misinterpretation as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of high-grade malignancy could easily occur. These findings also suggest that mixed-type (hybrid) acute leukemias with coexpression of myeloid and lymphoid cell markers could be more common than generally realized.","['S0046-8177(96)90012-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90012-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to the availability of mAbs directed against fixative-resistant epitopes of the CD45 molecule, this distinction can now easily be made even in routinely processed tissues. However, a small percentage of morphologically poorly defined neoplasms are difficult to diagnose even with the help of immunohistochemistry. The investigators report that 63 out of 165 anaplastic large-cell (ALC) lymphomas did not show any reactivity for the CD45 antigen in paraffin sections. In routine biopsies, the lymphomatous nature of these cases, most of which had been sent for consultation, could be always unequivocally established by demonstrating negativity for cytokeratins (mAb KL1) and clear dot-like and/or surface reactivity with the Ber-H2 mAb, which is directed against a fixative-resistant epitope of the lymphoid cell activation antigen CD30. Strikingly, 54% of the CD45-cases reacted with mAbs directed against fixative-resistant epitopes of the T cell-restricted CD45RO antigen (mAb UCHL1) or the B-restricted molecules CD45RA (mAb 4KB5) and L26 (unclustered). In order to avoid confusion of ALC lymphomas with anaplastic nonlymphoid tumors, pathologists must be aware of the existence of CD30+/CD45- ALC lymphomas, as they can mimic the above-mentioned malignancies both morphologically (due to the sinusoidal growth pattern) and phenotypically (due to the expression of EMA). The investigators conclude that the combined use of mAbs directed against fixative-resistant epitopes of the CD30, CD45RO, CD45RA, and L26 antigens and cytokeratins is essential for the correct diagnosis and treatment of these equivocal cases.","['S0046-8177(96)90009-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90009-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Capillaries of most tissues are CD34 positive, as are umbilical artery and, to a lesser extent, vein, but the endothelium of most large vessels and the endothelium of placental sinuses are not. Angioblastoma cells and parafollicular mesenchymal cells in fetal skin are also CD34 positive, as are some stromal elements. An approximately 110 Kd protein can be identified by Western blot analysis with CD34 antibodies in detergent extracts of freshly isolated umbilical vessel endothelial cells, and CD34 mRNA is present in cultured umbilical vein cells as well as other tissues rich in vascular endothelium (breast, placenta). These data indicate that the binding of CD34 antibodies to vascular endothelium is to the CD34 gene product, and not to crossreactive epitopes. Despite the presence of CD34 mRNA in cultured, proliferating endothelial cells, the latter do not bind CD34 antibodies. In addition, CD34 antigen cannot be upregulated by growth factors. We conclude that under these conditions, CD34 protein is downregulated or processed into another form that is unreactive with CD34 antibodies. Electron microscopy of umbilical artery, breast, and kidney capillary vessels reveals that in all three sites, CD34 molecules are concentrated on membrane processes, many of which interdigitate between adjacent endothelial cells. However, well-established endothelial cell contacts with tight junctions are CD34 negative.

Normal resting and stimulated lymphocytes do not express the antigen. The majority of individuals with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection express the antigen on their lymphocytes, and in these patients, the T lymphocyte may also be antigen positive. The antigen was found on B-lymphoid neoplasia from the early pre-B cell stage through terminally differentiated plasma cells, a characteristic not reported for other B cell-associated antigens. Studies on homozygous typing cells and cells from individuals with known HLA phenotypes indicate that the antigen does not segregate in a pattern characteristic for major histocompatibility antigens. The molecule is a heterodimeric polypeptide with the molecular weight and isoelectric points of the alpha and beta chains being 32,000 d/4 and 28,000 d/6, respectively. Evidence is presented that the 1D10 molecule is not HLA-DR, -DP, or -DQ. By extrapolation, we suggest that this novel molecule may represent HLA D-region gene expression of a gene(s) not normally expressed. Potential candidates are D-region pseudogenes. We conclude that the antigenic epitope identified by the 1D10 monoclonal antibody is unique among previously described B-lymphocyte antigens. Further studies of the factors controlling the expression of this molecule, as well as studies designed to look at the possible cellular function, may provide insights for understanding crucial events in the malignant transformation of lymphocytes.",['S0006-4971(20)83137-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although the M-O7E cell line was derived from a patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia, IL-9 has not proved to be a growth or maturation factor for megakaryocytes, but instead has proved to be effective in supporting the development of erythroid bursts (BFU-E) in cultures supplemented with erythropoietin. Using highly purified progenitors from peripheral blood, IL-3 showed a BFU-E plating efficiency of 46% compared with 20% for IL-9. Because of the purity of these cell preparations and the low cell density in culture, IL-9 is likely to interact directly with erythroid progenitors. Analysis of mixing experiments and of the morphology of the BFU-E in culture indicated that IL-9 interacts preferentially with a relatively early population of IL-3-responsive BFU-E. In cultures of human bone marrow or cord blood, IL-9 selectively supported erythroid colony formation, while IL-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor additionally yielded granulocyte/macrophage colonies.

Sixty-two bone marrow transplanted patients (46 with allograft, 16 with autograft) were enrolled in this study, and rhG-CSF was administered intravenously 30 min daily at a dose of 2, 5, 10, or 20 micrograms/kg/day for 14 consecutive days from day 1 or day 5 after transplantation. Compared with historical control, blood neutrophil recovery in greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/day group was clearly accelerated without delay in other blood cells. Consistent with the acceleration of neutrophil recovery, the number of days with body temperature (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) decreased during from day 15 to day 28. No adverse effects were observed, and there was no evidence that rhG-CSF affected the incidence of graft-versus-host disease and relapse rates of myeloid leukemia. These results suggest that the posttransplant use of rhG-CSF may be an efficient strategy for reducing the risk of bacterial and/or fungal infection complications in BMT.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remissions (CR), however, are rare, and a few patients do not respond adequately to alpha-IFN. That the poor response to alpha-IFN treatment could be related to a particular immunologic surface marker profile of the HC was investigated in this study. The results showed that most patients who do not respond adequately to alpha-IFN HC have a peculiar immunologic phenotype with a positive response to the Leu1 (CD5) monoclonal antibody, usually absent on HC but characteristically expressed on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Of nine HCL patients with this phenotype, only three had partial remissions (PR) and six minor responses (MR) compared with the three CR, 16 PR, and three MR observed in the 22 Leu1 (CD5)-negative patients.

Cultures treated with hGM-CSF demonstrated a peak of 12.8-, 21- and 3.2-fold elevations in total nonadherent cells, cluster, and GM-CFC, respectively, and influenced differentiation of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Cultures treated with gIL-3 demonstrated the largest expansion in the GM-CFC population, reaching a maximum of 5.3-fold in relation to that of unstimulated controls. IL-3 treatment also increased the numbers of GM clusters and mature cells (including all myeloid cells and lymphocytes) 7.8- and 4.8-fold, respectively. Similar quantitative and qualitative changes were induced by G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 in LTBMCs of patients in remission after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Overall, the expansion of GM progenitor cells in cultures treated with growth factors was larger in the adherent cell layer than in the nonadherent cell fraction. In addition, hGM-CSF, gIL-3, and hG-CSF to a less extent, increased the cycling rates of GM-CFC progenitors located in the adherent layer. These results indicate that hG-CSF is a much less potent stimulus of hematopoiesis in LTBMC than the other CSFs assayed, and that the increases in cell production after treatment with G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-3 may be achieved by primary expansion of different cell populations within the hierarchy of the hematopoietic system. The effects of the growth factors were transient and the longevity of hematopoiesis in the cultures was not altered, suggesting that treatment with IL-3, GM-CSF, or G-CSF had not compromised the ability of primitive cells to give rise to mature cells. This indicates that the stromal microenvironment in LTBMC can override potential differentiation-inducing activities of the CSFs.",['S0006-4971(20)84295-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The ontogenetic significance of this mixed lineage expression is unclear. We therefore studied the conviction of the lineage commitment in a group of MLL by examining the in-vitro response of five CD2+ (E-rosette receptor) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) to a panel of proliferation and differentiation-inducing agents. Three of the five CD2+ AML were TdT-positive. Antigen receptor gene studies revealed no rearrangements at either the T beta or immunoglobulin heavy chain gene loci in any case. When blast-enriched cell populations were placed in short term suspension cultures with PHA, IL-2, PHA + IL-2, GM-CSF or TPA, three of the leukemias responded in a similar fashion while the remaining two cases showed no response. In the three MLL that responded to the in-vitro culture manipulations, features indicative of differentiation along the monocytic lineage pathway were observed. This differentiation was not pronounced in the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, and was manifested by loss of CD2 and CD7 expression, continued expression of myeloid antigens, and the development by the blasts of morphologic and cytochemical characteristics of monocytic cells. None of the five MLL showed any evidence of induced maturation along the T-lymphocyte line of differentiation with any of the agents used. rGM-CSF was the only exogenously added agent to induce proliferation; the proliferative response was slight and was seen in only one of the five leukemias. Therefore, the phenotypic expression of CD2 and CD7 in blasts from MLL is not indicative of irreversible commitment to T-lymphocyte development. The in-vitro loss of T-cell antigens in concert with the development of monocytic features in three of the five CD2+ AML in this study suggests the leukemic cells were preferentially committed to a non-lymphoid lineage differentiation pathway.",['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90029-9 [doi]'],,,"['CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This therapeutic dose and schedule of drug administration did not produce any evidence of pulmonary histopathologic injury; at a similar dose and schedule bleomycin resulted in greater than 40% consolidation of alveolar lung space. Mouse lung collagen synthesis measured as rate of [3H]hydroxyproline formation was increased almost 4-fold by bleomycin 7 days following a single maximally tolerated i.v. injection (133 mg/kg); in contrast, Liblomycin (60 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the rate of lung collagen synthesis compared to saline injected control animals. Lung function was assessed by whole body plethysmography. Bleomycin produced an increase in breathing rates above control values by day 15 following administration of drug at 10 mg/kg (d1-10).

The only other toxicity noted in this study was the appearance after repeated intraperitoneal administration of Liblomycin of a hepatic collagenous fibrous capsule. The capsule formation resulted in an abnormal and grossly lobulated liver which was believed to have affected animal survival.

The in vitro potencies of these compounds against HIV infection in CEM cells were measured, with FddT and AZT being more potent than D4T. The cytotoxicities of D4T, FddT, and AZT for CEM cells were comparable. The triphosphates of these three derivatives inhibited purified HIV reverse transcriptase, and their affinities for this polymerase were found to be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude greater than that for the normal substrate, dTTP. D4T was less toxic than FddT or AZT for cultured human and mouse bone marrow cells (granulocyte-macrophage CFU). The three compounds had similar toxicities for human progenitor erythrocyte burst-forming units.

At the higher doses of FddT, a significant incidence of lethality occurred. By contrast, D4T was considerably less toxic than both AZT and FddT in this study. The dose-limiting toxicity of D4T in mice was hepatotoxicity.

Our results demonstrated that AZT treatment of C57BL/10 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus efficiently prevented the induction of immunodeficiency if started at the time of virus inoculation.

Although IL-1 induction of the IL-2 promoter in these cells required costimulus with phorbol myristate acetate, the signal induced by IL-1 was qualitatively different. We provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the phorbol ester signal is mediated by protein kinase C, and we show that the IL-1 signal is not. That IL-1 and phorbol myristate acetate represent different stimuli was shown by their response to protein kinase C inhibitors, capacity to synergize with increased intracellular free calcium, and requirement for protein synthesis. In addition we show that pretreatment with IL-1 can prime EL4 cells to subsequent activation by concentrations of phorbol esters not normally sufficient to induce IL-2 expression. Pretreated cells remained primed for at least 40 h after removal of the IL-1.

We have attempted to study this phenomenon in vitro by characterizing the cytolytic response of T cells from normal donors after in vitro activation with allogeneic leukemic cells. As expected, most T cells that react against an allogeneic patient's leukemic cells recognize their foreign HLA antigens and lyse the patient's nonleukemic remission lymphoid cells. In addition, we have shown that a small fraction of the T cells recognize and lyse foreign leukemic targets without lysis of nonmalignant remission targets from the same leukemic patient. These T cells have been isolated and characterized as CD3+, CD4+ cells expressing the alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR). Their lysis appears to reflect specific antigen recognition mediated via the CD3-TCR complex and interactions involving the CD4 receptor. Some of these ""leukemic specific"" T cell lines, which are restricted by HLA class II molecules, can also lyse occasional nonleukemic cells from certain unrelated donors.

Here we have tested LIF/DIA for possible effects on the growth and differentiation of normal human hematopoietic cells in culture. As a single agent, LIF/DIA had no effect on colony formation by CD34-positive human bone marrow cells. However, LIF/DIA was as effective as either interleukin-6 (IL-6) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the enhancement of IL-3-dependent colony formation of very primitive blast colony-forming cells. Studies using neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 or G-CSF demonstrated that this was not due to induction in culture of either of the other known synergistic factors for blast cell colony formation. A 1-day delay in the time course of appearance of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of LIF/DIA relative to those grown in the presence of IL-6 suggests that the different synergistic factors may operate through different mechanisms, although we cannot rule out that high doses of LIF/DIA might yield accelerated blast cell colony formation.

We wished to determine whether the lack of response with AKXL-5 spleen cells was at the level of recognition between effector cell and target cell and whether the relevant mutation was within the emv-14 provirus. It is shown here that EMV-negative SC-1 fibroblast cells transfected with the major histocompatibility complex class I Kb gene and infected with virus isolated from the AKXL-5 strain (SC.Kb/5 cells) were not lysed by H-2b-restricted anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. SC.Kb cells infected with virus isolated from emv-11+ strains, however, were efficiently lysed by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL, indicating that there is nothing intrinsic to EMV-infected SC.Kb cells that would prevent them from being recognized and lysed efficiently by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. Analysis of virus expression for the infected SC.Kb cells by XC plaque assay and by flow cytometry indicated that emv-14 virus expression for SC.Kb/5 cells was not significantly different from that for emv-11-containing SC.Kb/9 or SC.Kb/21 cells. These data show that the mutation responsible for the lack of CTL recognition and lysis is at the level of recognition between target cell and effector cell. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that the mutation is within the emv-14 genome. Flow cytometry experiments with monoclonal antibodies against a number of viral determinants indicated that there was no gross mutation detectable in the viral determinants analyzed. The data suggest that the relevant mutation may be a point mutation or a small insertion or deletion within a coding sequence that is critical for CTL recognition.",['10.1128/JVI.64.6.2608-2619.1990 [doi]'],PMC249439,,"['CA-36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Friend cells contain RI alpha, two RII subunits previously designated RII-52 and RII-54, and C alpha. When the cells are treated with 0.2 mM methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) and either 20 microM forskolin or 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP, RI alpha content declines 50-75% because of a large decrease in the t1/2 value for the dissociated RI alpha subunit; RII-54 expression is invariant, but the amount and rate of synthesis of RII-52 increases 10-15-fold (Schwartz, D. A., and Rubin, C. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6296-6303). We now demonstrate that RII-52 and RII-54 correspond to RII beta and RII alpha, respectively. When cAMP levels are elevated in Friend cells the abundance of the 3.3-kilobase RII beta mRNA increases 25-30-fold in parallel with the rate of RII beta subunit synthesis indicating that pretranslational control is operative. Other R and C mRNAs are not markedly induced. Surprisingly, the rate of transcriptional initiation of the RII beta gene and the stability of RII beta mRNA are not altered during RII beta induction. Rather, the induction of RII beta mRNA is associated with the accumulation of major (3.4 kilobases) and minor (4 kilobases) RII beta pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. It appears that the cAMP signal-transduction system alters a nuclear protein(s) such that either the proportion of RII beta pre-mRNAs that are processed to mature mRNAs and are exported to the cytoplasm is greatly increased or the nuclear precursors are stabilized. Thus, regulation is exerted at a posttranscriptional level. In order to establish directly a causal role for C in RII beta induction and to rule out artifacts introduced by the use of drugs such as forskolin, MIX, and cAMP analogs we stably transfected Friend cells with a vector containing C alpha cDNA under the regulation of the zinc-activated metallothionein I promoter. The addition of 0.15 mM ZnSO4 caused the accumulation of dissociated C subunits and the selective induction of RII beta.",['S0021-9258(19)39050-7 [pii]'],,,"['GM22792/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The quinone group may contribute to antitumor activity by inducing DNA strand breaks through the formation of free radicals and/or by influencing the alkylating activity of the quinone alkylators. The cytotoxic activity and DNA damage produced by the model quinone alkylating agents, benzoquinone mustard and benzoquinone dimustard, were compared in L5178Y murine lymphoblasts sensitive and resistant to the model quinone antitumor agent, hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. The resistant cell lines, L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10, have increased concentrations of glutathione and elevated catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and DT-diaphorase activity. L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells were 7.4- and 8.5-fold less sensitive to benzoquinone mustard and 1.7- and 4.3-fold less sensitive to benzoquinone dimustard, respectively, compared with sensitive cells, but showed no resistance to the non-quinone alkylating agent, aniline mustard. The formation of DNA double strand breaks by benzoquinone mustard was reduced by 2- and 8-fold in L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells, respectively, while double strand break formation by benzoquinone dimustard was reduced only in the L5178Y/HBM10 cells. The number of DNA-DNA cross-links produced by benzoquinone mustard was 3- and 6-fold lower, and the number produced by benzoquinone dimustard was 35% and 2-fold lower in L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells, respectively, compared with L5178Y parental cells. In contrast, cross-linking by aniline mustard was unchanged in sensitive and resistant cells. Dicoumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, increased the cytotoxic activity of both benzoquinone mustard and benzoquinone dimustard in L5178Y/HBM10 cells. This study provides evidence that elevated DT-diaphorase activity in the resistant cells contributes to resistance to benzoquinone mustard and benzoquinone dimustard, possibly by decreasing the formation of the semiquinone intermediates of these agents. The altered reduction of the quinone groups in the resistant cells may be responsible for the decreased DNA-DNA cross-linking and lowered induction of DNA strand breaks by the quinone alkylating agents. These findings demonstrate that the quinone group can modulate the activity of quinone alkylating agents. The study also suggests that the semiquinone intermediates of benzoquinone mustard and benzoquinone dimustard may be the active alkylating species of these two agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The test was highly sensitive (93%) in detecting immune-thrombocytopenia. The specificity, however, was only 57%, which is less than in published studies of adults. In a number of cases presumed to be non-immune-thrombocytopenia, notably a few patients with leukaemia and bone marrow aplasia, we found increased amounts of platelet surface-bound IgG. The significance of this finding is not clear. An indirect assay measuring platelet-specific IgG in plasma was less sensitive (46%) but highly specific for immune-thrombocytopenia (89%). The measurements of platelet-surface-bound IgG and platelet-specific IgG in plasma are of limited diagnostic value in childhood thrombocytopenia but are useful in following the treatment in chronic ITP.",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1990.tb11465.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The untreated cells contained typical cytoplasmic coiling bundles, positive for both vimentin and cytokeratin as judged by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Some of the cells also showed bright immunoreactivity for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), as revealed with a Mab and polyclonal antiserum. When exposed to hemin or to sodium butyrate, most of the cells became cytokeratin negative within 3 days and showed dispersion of vimentin fibrils. Upon exposure to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the amount of both vimentin and cytokeratin appeared to be greatly increased within 3 days and was found both in dispersed cytoplasmic fibrils, in large spherical, eccentric aggregates, as well as in cytoplasmic fibrils in cells spreading on fibronectin. TPA induced a complete loss of proliferation, as judged by immunostaining with the Mab Ki-67. The effects of TPA were found to be irreversible and could be induced by only a short exposure to the drug. Western blotting analysis and monoclonal antibodies to individual cytokeratins revealed that untreated K562 cells expressed Mr 52,000 (No. 8), 46,000 (No. 18), and 40,000 (No. 19) cytokeratin polypeptides, which disappeared when the cells were exposed to hemin or to sodium butyrate to induce erythroid differentiation but were greatly enhanced when exposed to TPA. The monoclonal anti EMA antibody reacted in K562 cells with a single Mr 320,000 polypeptide that was also revealed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Human bone marrow cells or other leukemic cell lines with erythroid differentiation capacity (HEL and KG-1) did not contain cytokeratin- or EMA-immunoreactive cells, suggesting that in K562 cells these properties may rather represent abnormal cytodifferentiation or retrodifferentiation toward early embryonic mesenchymal cells, than a more general expression of epithelial features in human leukemic cells.",['10.1002/jcp.1041430215 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This increase in globin chain biosynthesis was reflected by an increase in relative amounts of steady-state gamma-globin mRNA. In contrast to its effect on adult cells, FCS failed to influence gamma-chain synthesis in fetal burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) colonies.

Immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates of purified CGL basophils and CD25 MoAbs showed a protein with a molecular weight of 60 Kd, equivalent to the Tac peptide on human T blasts. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis using radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-2 indicated the presence of 12,000 +/- 4,700 low affinity IL-2 binding sites (kd = 66 nmol/L) per purified CGL basophil. Northern blot analysis with enriched CGL basophils showed two messenger RNA bands of 3.5 and 1.5 kilobases hybridizing to radiolabeled Tac cDNA.

At this concentration, trinitrophenol-ovalbumin increased histamine release from a basal rate of 4.8 +/- 0.5 to 28.5 +/- 4.6% and peptidoleukotrienes from less than 0.1 to 4.2 +/- 1.3 ng/10(6) cells in the activated cells.

Insertion kinetics for the properly matched nucleotide at a given place on the template vary strongly from one enzyme to the next. No significant correlation is found between the site-specific Michaelis constants, while the maximal velocities are more closely connected. For a given reverse transcriptase these parameters are strongly influenced by the DNA sequence. A systematic evaluation of the frequencies of misincorporation was then performed at 46 positions. Again great variability was found, precluding a very accurate evaluation of an average misincorporation frequency for a given enzyme and a given mismatch. Qualitatively however, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is certainly not more error-prone in this assay than the other enzymes assayed. The patterns of misincorporations were again very dependent on the enzyme used to replicate a given template. The variability of the gag sequence observed in vivo among various HIV-1 isolates was compared with the patterns of misincorporations obtained in vitro on the same sequence with HIV-1, AMV and MoMLV reverse transcriptases. A fair agreement was found with the pattern observed in the polymerization directed by the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The correlation is less important in the two other cases. However some specific changes observed in vivo cannot be accounted for by our misincorporation assay, even when performed with the homologous enzyme, suggesting that an important class of mismatches can only be generated during reverse transcription of the RNA strand.

Mutant forms of RT that had been previously analyzed for their RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity were tested for RNase H activity using an in situ polyacrylamide gel assay. Mutations affecting the RNase H are not clustered in a single region of the 66-kDa RT molecule. With only few exceptions, mutations that affect the RNase H activity also cause a substantial decrease in the DNA polymerase function. This suggests that, unlike the RT from murine leukemia virus (MuLV), it is difficult to genetically separate the catalytic domains responsible for the RNase H and DNA polymerase functions of HIV-1 RT. Those few mutations that differentially affect the RNase H and the polymerase activities of HIV-1 RT suggest that, as in MuLV, the polymerase domain is in the amino-terminus and the RNase H domain is in the carboxy-terminus. We have also generated chimeric molecules that are composed of sequences from the RT of HIV-1 and MuLV and these hybrid RTs were analyzed for their enzymatic properties.

In this report, we present the characterization of a new locus of common integration in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas (Mlvi-4) which maps 30 kilobases 3' of c-myc, between c-myc and Mlvi-1. The Mlvi-4 locus, whose chromosomal map location is conserved in rats, mice, and humans, is also the target of chromosomal rearrangements in a variety of animal and human tumors. Evidence presented elsewhere shows that provirus integration in Mlvi-4 enhances the expression of c-myc and Mlvi-1 by cis-acting mechanisms operating over long distances of genomic DNA. In this manuscript, we show that provirus integration in the Mlvi-4 locus activates, by promoter insertion, one additional gene which maps immediately 3' to the cluster of the Mlvi-4 proviruses and which is transcribed in the same orientation as c-myc, giving rise to 3- and 10-kilobase mRNA transcripts. The Mlvi-4 gene is also expressed in normal thymus and spleen at very low levels, giving rise to 3- and 5.5-kilobase messages. Although Mlvi-4 is expressed in normal thymus, it is not expressed in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas corresponding to several stages of T-cell differentiation, but lacking a provirus in this locus. This suggests that Mlvi-4 may be expressed only in a subpopulation of T cells. We conclude that provirus insertion in Mlvi-4 activates c-myc and two additional genes, Mlvi-1 and Mlvi-4, whose expression is restricted to, and may be developmentally regulated in, T cells. Since Mlvi-4 is the target of genetic changes in a great variety of human and animal neoplasms, these results are critical for our understanding of oncogenesis.",['10.1128/JVI.64.5.2236-2244.1990 [doi]'],PMC249384,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,['GENBANK/M36432'],,,,,

These in vitro parameters correlated with in vivo hematologic responses in our Phase I and II clinical trials. In this study 18 patients were treated for two months with s.c. administration (0.1-3 micrograms/kg/day) of G-CSF, escalating doses every two weeks. This study indicated normalization of neutrophil courses in 16 patients and reticulocyte responses with decreased red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements in three of 12 transfusion-dependent patients. Marrow myeloid maturation improved in the responding patients. Extended treatment for additional six- to 16-month periods has indicated persisting neutrophil responses. The relative risk of developing bacterial infections was significantly decreased in patients whose neutrophil level normalized (absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm3) during G-CSF therapy, compared to such episodes in their pretreatment neutropenic period. This therapy was well-tolerated, without serious toxicity being noted. In vitro neutrophil function (chemotaxis and phagocytosis) remained normal or improved in six of the eight tested patients. Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred in two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) during or within a month of the treatment period.

Both the NAP activity and incorporation of amino acids into PMN were enhanced by the addition of G-CSF in a dose-dependent manner. NAP activity induced by G-CSF in PMN from CML patients showed a greater increase than that in PMN from normal controls. In contrast to G-CSF, GM-CSF did not affect the NAP activity in PMN in spite of the enhanced incorporation of amino acids into PMN by GM-CSF. Interestingly, both the NAP-inducing ability of G-CSF and its enhancing ability for amino acid incorporation were suppressed by GM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner when PMN were incubated with various concentrations of GM-CSF in addition to 100 ng/ml of G-CSF. These observations suggest that G-CSF and GM-CSF act differently: G-CSF induces NAP synthesis in PMN, whereas GM-CSF negatively modulates the effect of G-CSF. Further, it is suggested that protein synthesis induced by G-CSF is negatively modulated by GM-CSF in a general fashion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the impact of bcr-abl upon haemopoiesis, lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells enriched for cycling stem cells and infected with a bcr-abl bearing retrovirus. The mice developed several fatal diseases with abnormal accumulations of macrophage, erythroid, mast and lymphoid cells, and marked strain differences in disease distribution and kinetics. Some mice exhibited more than one neoplastic cell type and, in some instances, these were clonally related, indicating that a progenitor or stem cell had been transformed. While classical CML was not observed, the macrophage tumours were accompanied by a mild CML-like syndrome, probably due to myeloid growth factor production by tumour cells. The erythroid and mast cell diseases were rarely transplantable, in contrast to the macrophage tumours and lymphomas, but all disease types displayed limited clonality. These results establish that bcr-abl confers a proliferative advantage on diverse haemopoietic cells but complete transformation probably involves additional genetic changes.",,PMC551781,,['CA 12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells at 11 degrees C, more than 80% of the 0.7 fmol of Ca2+/cell sequestered by the ATP-driven pump could be released by IP3. Half of the stored Ca2+ was released within 200 ms after addition of saturating (1 microM) IP3. The flux rate was half-maximal at 120 nM IP3. Ca2+ release from fully loaded stores was highly cooperative; the Hill coefficient over the 2-40 nM range was greater than 3. The delay time of channel opening was inversely proportional to [IP3], increasing from 150 ms at 100 nM IP3 to 1 s at 15 nM, indicating that the rate-limiting step in channel opening is IP3 binding. Multiple binding steps are required to account for the observed delay and nonexponential character of channel opening. A simple model is proposed in which the binding of four IP3 molecules to identical and independent sites leads to channel opening. The model agrees well with the data for KD = 18 nM, kon = 1.2 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, and koff = 2.2 s-1. The approximately 1-s exchange time of bound IP3 indicates that the channel gating sites are distinct from binding sites having approximately 100-s exchange times that were previously found with radiolabeled IP3.

Five cases with T-ALL, four with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL), and seven with peripheral T-cell lymphomas were positive for beta F1. None showed positive reactivity for delta TCS1. One case with T-LL and four cases with peripheral T-cell lymphomas were positive for WT31. Of the nine cases positive for beta F1 among T-ALLs and T-LLs, six were also positive for CD1 (OKT6), whereas six of seven positive cases for CD1 were positive for beta F1. The authors therefore suggest that TCR beta is expressed in the immature T-cells just earlier than or around the same stage of differentiation as those expressing CD1. The authors' immuno-electron microscopy study revealed that positive reactivity for beta F1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells in the cases with T-ALL, T-LL and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and in the cytoplasm of the reactive T-cells. However, it was not localized on the surface membrane. In contrast, positive reactivity for WT31 was localized on the surface membrane of the neoplastic and reactive T-cells. Only half of the cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas showed positive reactivity for WT31.

The leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a glycoprotein, with intriguing properties, which can either induce differentiation in some myeloid leukaemic cell lines or prevent differentiation in normal totipotential embryonic stem cells.

The latent form of the cell surface protease has been used as a protecting mechanism during a preliminary step to stain all the nuclei of cells with haematoxylin. The enzyme-inhibitor complex was then dissociated and a combination of 9-amino acridine and propidium iodide employed to enable the fluorescent location of cells possessing active guanidinobenzoatase. We were thus able to visualise the nuclei by conventional light microscopy and simultaneously visualise the cell surface of leukaemia cells by fluorescent microscopy.

Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 0.2 micrograms/ml CSA. The effect of CSA on several biochemical parameters involved in receptor-mediated activation of RBL cells was examined. Maximum inhibition of secretion occurred when CSA was added 5 min before activation, and inhibition was nearly maximum when the drug was added 2 min before the cells were triggered. The same results were observed when RBL cells were stimulated with A23187, a calcium ionophore. These results suggest a mechanism other than inhibition of protein synthesis is involved. Inhibition by CSA of release by either secretagogue persisted, even if CSA was removed from the buffer before the cells were triggered. No inhibition was observed of either receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, 45Ca2+ uptake, or the rise in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ under the same conditions that produced greater than 80% inhibition of serotonin release. These results demonstrate that the early events in signal transduction are not affected, and suggest that the intracellular target for CSA participates in a later stage of exocytosis. Furthermore, the data suggest that CSA suppresses cells other than T lymphocytes and predict that patients on CSA therapy may have altered response to allergens.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a study with three monoclonal antibodies which recognize an extracytoplasmic determinant present on all forms of the invariant chain and use them to demonstrate its presence on the surface of the intact cells. The determinants recognized by two of the antibodies were found to be located within the 60 amino acids at the extreme C-terminal (extracytoplasmic) end of the invariant chain. The invariant chain-specific monoclonal antibody, VIC-Y1, was found to bind a determinant located between amino acids 1 and 73, which correspond to mainly cytoplasmic residues. Using the C-terminal specific antibodies, the number of antibody binding sites on the surface of two B lymphoma lines was estimated to be 10(5) per cell. The results of this study appear to resolve the highly disputed question of whether or not the invariant chain can appear as a plasma membrane protein.

The main toxicity associated with BLM therapy is an acute pulmonary inflammation that can culminate in diffuse chronic fibrosis. The effect of BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation on the cytostatic activity of alveolar macrophages (AM) was investigated using AM obtained from rats that had been previously treated with BLM. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected at selected time intervals following a single fibrogenic dose of intratracheally administered BLM (3.6 mg/kg). AM obtained 12 to 72 h following intratracheal BLM (BLM-AM) caused cytostasis of murine leukemia L1210 cells in co-culture, whereas AM obtained from saline-treated controls were not cytostatic. These results indicate that the growth-inhibitory activity of the AM was related to the pulmonary inflammation. Cytostatic activity in control AM could be induced by in vitro exposure to lipopolysaccharide (5 micrograms). When RBC were added to the AM-L1210 co-culture, the cytostatic activity of the BLM-AM was abrogated. The fact that chemical treatment of the RBC with sodium nitrite and potassium cyanide or N-ethylmaleimide did not alter the ability of the RBC to abrogate AM cytostatic activity suggests that the RBC is not acting as a scavenger of oxygen radicals. In contrast, the addition of FeSO4 to the AM-L1210 co-culture mimicked the effect of RBC addition. Aconitase, an iron-sulfur-containing enzyme necessary for mitochondrial respiration, is decreased in L1210 cells that have been co-cultured with BLM-AM but not when the co-cultures also contain RBC. These results suggest that (a) pulmonary inflammation induces cytostatic activity in AM, (b) the alteration of iron homeostasis plays an important role in this cytostatic process, and (c) RBC can prevent this cytostatic activity.",,,,"['CA-01205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The structure recognized by BB10 is distinct from FcE RI and modulates the IgE-dependent histamine release.

During infection, retroviral RNA genomes are first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) and then to double-stranded DNA. Thus recombination could occur during reverse transcription, by RNA template switching, or after reverse transcription, by breakage and reunion of DNA. It has not been possible to distinguish between these two potential mechanisms of recombination because both single-stranded cDNA and double-stranded proviral DNA exist in infected cells during the eclipse period. Therefore we have analyzed for recombinant molecules among cDNA products transcribed in vitro from RNA of disrupted virions. Since recombinants from allelic parents can only be distinguished from parental genomes by point mutations, we have examined the cDNAs from virions with distinct genetic structures for recombinant-specific size and sequence markers. The parents share a common internal allele that allows homology-directed recombination, but each contains specific flanking sequences. One parent is a synthetically altered Harvey murine sarcoma virus RNA that lacks a retroviral 3' terminus but carries a Moloney murine retrovirus-derived envelope gene (env) fragment 3' of its transforming ras gene. The other parent is intact Moloney virus. Using a Harvey-specific 5' primer and a Moloney-specific 3' primer, we have found recombinant cDNAs with the polymerase chain reaction, proving directly that retroviruses can recombine during reverse transcription unassisted by cellular enzymes, probably by template switching during cDNA synthesis.

G-CSF however has a substantial growth including effect which limits its potential as a differentiation inducing agent. We have therefore made a systematic search for agents which might restrain the proliferative effects of G-CSF whilst retaining the differentiation stimulus. Of all the agents we have tested on human bone marrow progenitor cells: (6-thioguanine, all-trans retinoic acid, vincristine, recombinant human alpha-2b and gamma-interferon) only the latter abolished the stimulation of cell growth and retained, or possibly increased, the differentiation effect of G-CSF. The antiproliferative drugs 6-thioguanine and vincristine both antagonized the neutrophil-granulocyte differentiation inducing action of G-CSF. Retinoic acid and alpha-2b interferon both had weak effects on proliferation and failed to enhance differentiation. These results suggest that it may be possible, by combining G-CSF with a suitable second agent, to utilize its substantial differentiation inducing effect without incurring the potentially hazardous effects of increased leukemic cell growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of these antigens was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of plastic embedded sections of bone marrow or isolated cells, and by immunostaining of isolated glycosphingolipids separated by thin layer chromatography. The expression of both antigens was restricted to normal and leukemic myeloid cells. A range of positive immunohistochemical staining was found among normal marrow myeloid precursors, with myeloblasts giving weaker staining than more mature cells (promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes). A similar trend was observed with leukemia cell lines, in that the myeloblastic cell line KG1 was weakly stained compared to the partially differentiated cell line HL-60. Immunohistochemical staining of marrows from acute leukemia patients showed that the VIM-2 antigen is more strongly expressed than the SSEA-1 antigen. Interestingly, both antibodies stained AMMoL cells more intensely than AML cells. Granulocytes from marrows of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients were intensely stained by both antibodies, whereas lymphocytic leukemias (acute lymphocytic, chronic lymphocytic and hairy cell marrows) were negative. Thus, although both antigens are restricted to myeloid cells there are differences in the level of expression depending on the level of cell maturity. Immunostaining of glycosphingolipids isolated from myeloid cells demonstrated that the SSEA-1 epitope is carried by several neutral glycosphingolipids and that the VIM-2 epitope is carried by three or more gangliosides. Major SSEA-1 glycosphingolipids, with seven to more than ten monosaccharides, are expressed by all myeloid cells regardless of the level of maturity, although quantitative differences are apparent in different patient samples. Two strongly immunoreactive VIM-2 gangliosides with ten and twelve monosaccharides, respectively were found in myeloid cells. The ratio of these two gangliosides varied dramatically, with greater amounts of the more complex ganglioside being present in most cell samples. Normal neutrophils and CML cells had much greater quantities of the VIM-2 gangliosides than acute leukemia cells. This observation correlates with our earlier findings that: (1) acute leukemia cells have less total ganglioside than granulocytes and (2) acute leukemia cells have a predominance of short chain gangliosides (i.e. less than five monosaccharide units). Finally, both CML cells and normal neutrophils express a shorter chain VIM-2 ganglioside, which was not detected in acute myelogenous leukemia cells.",['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90040-g [doi]'],,,"['AI24286/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

These enzymes have been shown to be structurally and functionally related to aspartyl proteinases such as pepsin and renin. Cerulenin is a naturally occurring antibiotic, commonly used as an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis. Cerulenin has been observed to inhibit production of Rous sarcoma virus and murine leukaemia virus by infected cells, possibly by interfering with proteolytic processing of viral precursor proteins. We show here that cerulenin inhibits the action of the HIV-1 proteinase in vitro, using 3 substrates: a synthetic heptapeptide (SQNYPIV) which corresponds to the sequence at the HIV-1 gag p17/p24 junction, a bacterially expressed gag precursor, and purified 66 kDa reverse transcriptase. Inhibition of cleavage by HIV-1 proteinase required preincubation with cerulenin. Cerulenin also inactivates endothiapepsin, a well-characterised fungal aspartyl proteinase, suggesting that the action of cerulenin is a function of the common active site structure of the retroviral and aspartic proteinases. Molecular modelling suggests that cerulenin possesses several of the necessary structural features of an inhibitor of aspartyl proteinases and retroviral proteinases. Although cerulenin itself is cytotoxic and inappropriate for clinical use, it may provide leads for the rational design of inhibitors of the HIV proteinase which could have application in the chemotherapy of AIDS.","['0014-5793(90)80595-A [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(90)80595-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

N syndrome fibroblasts were studied to see if the high chromosome breakage rate associated with this apparently X-linked syndrome could be related to a deficiency of DNA polymerase alpha, a product of a gene localized to the X chromosome. Bleomycin, which is known to break double-stranded DNA, produced increased chromosome breakage in normal control, Fanconi anemia, and N syndrome fibroblasts. When aphidicolin was used to inhibit repair mediated by DNA polymerase alpha, both normal control and Fanconi anemia fibroblasts showed significantly more chromosome breakage than was produced by bleomycin alone, but there was no increase in the amount of breakage seen in the N syndrome fibroblasts over that seen with bleomycin alone. This suggests that the N syndrome is due to a mutation affecting the region of the X chromosome on which the gene for DNA polymerase alpha is located, and that the high risk of T-cell leukemia observed in the hemizygote is due to this DNA repair defect.",['10.1002/ajmg.1320350302 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

""Positive selection"" of marrow stem cells for grafting is a possible alternative strategy, using a monoclonal antibody which selectively recognizes lymphohematopoietic stem cells. The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen, CD34, is an integral cell membrane glycoprotein of approximately 115 kD, which has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Although its function has not been determined, the glycoprotein has been characterized biochemically, including preliminary epitope mapping. Collective results from several laboratories indicate that CD34 monoclonal antibodies (My10, BI-3C5, 12.8, etc.) have the appropriate specificity to warrant testing their utility in positive selection for autologous bone marrow transplantation. First, precursors for all human hematopoietic lineages assayed (including most CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-MEG, CFU-EO, CFU-MIX or CFU-GEMM, pre-CFU, CFUBLAST, and terminal transferase+ B [and probably T] lymphoid precursors) are CD34+. Second, only 1.5% (mean) of low density human marrow mononuclear cells express CD34; mature human blood and marrow cells are CD34-. Endothelial cells are the only fixed tissue cells which express CD34. Third, the expression of CD34 in malignancies appears to parallel normal cellular expression: of hematopoietic malignancies, some acute leukemias and chronic myelogenous leukemia blasts are CD34+, but chronic lymphois leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas and non-hematopoietic malignancies are uniformly CD34-. Fourth, it appears feasible to isolate CD34+ cells from clinical marrow harvest samples in large scale, using either columns or immunomagnetic microspheres. Fifth, recent studies in very small numbers of non-human primates and human patients suggest that isolated CD34+ cells include the true hematopoietic stem cell, since transplantation of CD34+ cells, into myeloblated recipients results in at least short-term hematopoietic engraftment. It is anticipated that transplantation of CD34+ marrow cells may have broad applicability in clinical bone marrow transplantation.",,,,"['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Increased tyrosine phosphorylation was evident on at least 12 substrates within 2 min after ligation of the TCR with mAb. Analysis of the time course for increased tyrosine phosphorylation revealed distinct patterns. Increased phosphorylation of 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates was evident within 5 s, whereas increased phosphorylation of the TCR-zeta-chain required several minutes after treatment with anti-CD3 mAb. This rapid cellular tyrosine phosphorylation occurred independent of the cell cycle, as it occurred after stimulation of resting T cells, T cell blasts, and the Jurkat T cell leukemia line. When the TCR complex was cross-linked together with the CD4 receptor by heteroconjugate anti-CD3/CD4 mAb, an increased magnitude of tyrosine phosphorylation occurred, although no new substrates could be detected. The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates was specific in that anti-HLA class I, anti-CD6, anti-CD7, and anti-CD28 antibodies did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Anti-CD4 stimulation of resting T cells did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 and pp135, suggesting that the CD4-associated kinase, lck, does not account for the tyrosine phosphorylation observed after TCR stimulation. Similarly, pharmacologic treatment of cells with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore did not cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates, indicating that activation of protein kinase C or phospholipase C does not account for these early increases in tyrosine phosphorylation. The time of onset of pp100 phosphorylation, and the magnitude of phosphorylation correlated with the magnitude of calcium mobilization when cells were stimulated with different forms of TCR stimulation. When cells were labeled with [3H]myoinositol and analyzed after stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 135-kDa and 100-kDa substrates preceded the activation of phospholipase C, as measured by the appearance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This occurred in both T cell blasts and in the Jurkat T cell line. Thus, these findings show that increased tyrosine phosphorylation is the earliest yet detected signal observed after ligation of the TCR complex, and furthermore suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation might link the TCR to the phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate hydrolysis signaling pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased expression of all three determinants was associated with myelomonocytic leukaemias, with their relative diagnostic value in discriminating monocytic (M4 and M5) from non-monocytic (M1, M2 and M3) subtypes being CD14 greater than CD11c greater than CD11b. However, the results also indicated, because of the heterogenous expression of CD11c in particular, and to a lesser extent CD11b, that the patterns or histograms of fluorescent staining were potentially more informative than an empirical subdivision of blasts into positive and negative subpopulations. In addition, analysis of phenotypic correlations by simultaneous two-colour fluorescence showed that the expression of CD11b and CD11c determinants by leukaemic myeloid blasts was highly correlated, in contrast to the expression of CD14 and CD11c which were relatively independent. Consequently, CD11c+ myeloid blasts almost always coexpressed CD11b whereas CD14+ cases of AML often comprised CD14+ CD11c+ and CD14+ CD11c- subpopulations. It is concluded from these observations that CD11c immunophenotyping is a useful supplementary investigation, particularly in CD14- cases of myelomonocytic leukaemia. However, it is also apparent that the presence of membrane CD11c per se is not lineage-specific and that the level of expression is perhaps a more discriminatory factor.",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1990.tb00342.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Other cellular organelles were unaffected by the drug. The overall morphological effect by 2,5-diamino-3-hexyne was nearly identical to that produced in the same cells by the known lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine. Since the putrescine analogue, 1,4-diamino-2-butyne at 1.2 mM, also produced comparable cytoplasmic vacuolation, and putrescine itself failed to do so at concentrations as high as 5 mM, it was concluded that the apparent lysosomotropic activity of the putrescine analogues was probably due to their weaker basicity related to the presence of an internal triple bond.

Camptothecin specifically inhibits topoisomerase I by stabilization of a covalently linked DNA-enzyme complex and associated DNA single-strand breaks. Whether perturbations in nuclear DNA structure can alter camptothecin-induced DNA damage was examined using the non-intercalative DNA minor groove binders distamycin, Hoechst 33258 and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). L1210 nuclei were treated with camptothecin alone or in the presence of single minor groove binders. DNA-protein crosslinks and single-strand breaks were determined using potassium-sodium dodecyl sulfate precipitation and alkaline elution respectively. Distamycin produced a dose-dependent decrease in DNA-protein crosslinks and strand breaks. This effect was reduced if nuclei were treated with camptothecin prior to distamycin addition. Distamycin was unable to reverse lesions once induced or to prevent repair of damage upon camptothecin removal. Hoechst 33258 and DAPI also decreased camptothecin-induced DNA damage. The order of inhibitory potency was: distamycin greater than Hoechst greater than DAPI. This order corresponded to the molecular weights as well as to the size of the nucleotide binding sites of the drugs. Identifying agents which alter such DNA lesions should provide better understanding of the chemotherapeutic activity of camptothecin as well as help elucidate new leads for drug combinations of improved therapeutic benefit.","['0006-2952(90)90149-F [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90149-f [doi]']",,,['CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

It has the longest period of follow-up and is best studied as to its benefits and acute and long-term side effects. The acute toxicity of the side effects, including nausea and/or vomiting, hair loss, and myelosuppression, may have been reason to modify doses of nitrogen mustard, an agent whose dose intensity may be critical in achieving long-term benefits. The substitution of chlorambucil and vinblastine in the ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone) program has relieved all of these acute toxicities, except myelosuppression. The long-term toxicity of sterility, especially in males, and myelodysplasia is most likely due to alkylating-agent toxicity and would not be influenced by the various MOPP variants, such as MVPP (mechlorethamine, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone), ChlVPP, and COPP (chlorambucil-vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone). Doxorubicin-containing regimens, such as ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and ABDIC (doxorubicin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, lomustine, prednisone), have been second-line treatments that have significant antitumor effect and, as such, have resulted in few, if any, long-term cures in most series. ABVD has been incorporated into alternating MOPP/ABVD schemes or in hybrids that attempt to offer all active agents, such as MOPP/ABV. The initial experience has been encouraging with high and durable complete remissions (CRs). MOPP/ABVD x 12(1) and MOPP-2/ABVD-2(2) have been compared with MOPP alone with a significant superiority for the alternating regimens. Other randomized trials have not shown any superiority for the alternating program. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) has compared MOPP with MOPP/ABVD given with a third arm of ABVD alone. The complete response and time-to-treatment failure rates for MOPP/ABVD and ABVD alone were superior to those for MOPP. Significant modifications of MOPP doses may explain the differences, since only 20% of patients were receiving full doses of nitrogen mustard by the sixth dose. ABVD has unique toxicity, and myelodysplasia and sterility are not seen. Pulmonary fibrosis with radiation and bleomycin is unique to ABVD, as shown in the ABVD experience at the NCl (Milan). Can ABVD be improved? The demonstrated single-dose activity of etoposide in Hodgkin's disease has prompted its inclusion in second-line programs, such as EVA (etoposide, vincristine or vinblastine, doxorubicin). The second-line response rates in the St Bartholomew's (London, England) series (where vincristine was used) was 11 of 19 patients (58%);3 in the ongoing CALGB trial of EVA (vinblastine combination), the response rate is 67%.

Also known as PADGEM protein, GMP-140 is structurally related to two molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium: ELAM-1, a cytokine-inducible endothelial cell receptor for neutrophils, and the MEL-14 lymphocyte homing receptor. These three proteins define a new gene family, termed selectins, each of which contains an N-terminal lectin domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor-like module, a variable number of repeating units related to those in complement-binding proteins, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Here we demonstrate that GMP-140 can mediate leukocyte adhesion, thus establishing a functional similarity with the other selectins. Human neutrophils and promyelocytic HL-60 cells bind specifically to COS cells transfected with GMP-140 complementary DNA and to microtitre wells coated with purified GMP-140. Cell binding does not require active neutrophil metabolism but is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Within minutes after stimulation with phorbol esters or histamine, human endothelial cells become adhesive for neutrophils; this interaction is inhibited by antibodies to GMP-140. Thus, GMP-140 expressed by activated endothelium might promote rapid neutrophil targeting to sites of acute inflammation.",['10.1038/343757a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data indicate that CD5+ leukemic cells may express autoantibody-associated V region genes with little or no somatic mutation. We examined the Heavy chain V genes expressed by an unusual CLL that secretes rheumatoid factor (RF) autoantibodies but does not express the CD5 surface Ag. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the rearranged VH genes of three independent rDNA clones demonstrated intraclonal diversity not apparent in previously studied cases of CD5+ CLL. Comparison of the rearranged VH genes reveals that they belong to the VH4 gene subgroup and share highest homology with a rearranged VH gene (Ab44) that encodes a polyreactive autoantibody. That these productively rearranged VH genes encode the RF generated by this unusual CLL population is demonstrated by immunoblotting of the RF paraprotein using primary sequence dependent antipeptide antisera.

An experimental autoimmune uveitis and pinealitis was induced in Lewis rats with these different synthetic peptides, corresponding to the amino sequence of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, gag-pol polyprotein of Baboon endogenous virus and gag-pol polyprotein of AKV murine leukemia virus and potato proteinase inhibitor IIa, which contain three or more consecutive amino acids identical to peptide M in S-Ag.

Mononuclear cells from monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with peptide M also showed significant proliferation when incubated with either peptide M or synthetic peptides as measured by in vitro lymphocyte mitogenesis assay using [3H]TdR.

The latter is detected by the increased metachromatic stainability of DNA with acridine orange (AO) and sensitivity to S1 nuclease, measured by flow cytometry. Decreased DNA stability is generally characteristic of chromatin condensation and in untreated cells is observed in mitosis or quiescence (G0). The caffeine-induced decrease in DNA stability affects the interphase cells regardless of their position in the cycle and the changes are stochastic, concentration- and time-dependent. Populations of cells responding to caffeine are very heterogenous with respect to the degree of destabilization of DNA; sensitivity of DNA to denaturation of the maximally affected cells is similar to that of untreated cells in mitosis. The present method allows one to quantitatively express effects of caffeine on nuclear chromatin in individual cells of large cell populations and may be employed in studies correlating chromatin changes induced by this agent with its effects in modulation of cell sensitivity to radiation or antitumour drugs.",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1990.tb01107.x [doi]'],,,"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The absolute numbers of CD 57+, CD 16+ and cytotoxic CD 8+ lymphocytes were increased in the peripheral blood of untreated patients as compared with healthy donors, suggesting a causal relation with the accumulation of malignant B-cells. For 5 B-CLL patients and 5 hematological normal donors, the lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, lymph nodes and bone marrow were determined. A significant immune response was observed in the lymph nodes of the patients, as reflected by the CD 3+ lymphocytes, which were 1.7-27 times larger in the patients lymph nodes than in their peripheral blood and bone marrow. In contrast, with peripheral blood this was mainly caused by an increase in CD 4+ lymphocytes. The CD 57 lymphocytes in the lymph nodes of the patients had abnormal orthogonal light-scattering signals and an abnormal density of CD 57+ receptors in comparison with their peripheral blood CD 57+ lymphocytes or the CD 57+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and tonsils of the hematological normal donors.

Correctly initiated ""A gamma-neo"" transcripts were detected with an S1 nuclease protection assay that was internally controlled for transfection efficiency and RNA content. We first optimized the conditions for electroporation, and then determined input DNA concentrations that permitted study of gamma-promoter function in the linear range of the assay. We discovered that a gamma-globin promoter fragment extending from -299 to +36 (with respect to the transcription initiation site) was active in this transient transfection assay, and that the expression of this promoter was increased by the SV40 enhancer. Deletion of the gamma-globin promoter to position -199 did not significantly affect gamma-globin promoter function. However, deletion to -160 reduced gamma promoter strength to 70% that of control, deletion to position -130 to 19% that of control, and deletion to position -61 to 8.7% that of control. Three gamma-globin promoters containing mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (-202 C----G, -196 C----T, and -117 G----A) were not overexpressed in the K562 cell environment, consistent with the hypothesis that these promoters are not overexpressed in fetal erythroblasts, only adult erythroid cells.

Both TAT and PAP were markedly elevated in patients with DIC. When plotted by the underlying disease categories, differences in the magnitude of the elevations of these complexes were recognized among groups. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) had the highest PAP, the lowest TAT/PAP ratio, low a2AP, and low fibrinogen, indicating that the most excessive fibrinolysis can occur in APL. Similar profiles, although less marked, were observed in patients with other leukemias and vascular diseases. Patients with sepsis showed the highest TAT/PAP ratio and the lowest PAP with no decrease in a2AP or fibrinogen, demonstrating a relatively impaired fibrinolysis. Patients with cancer had a relatively high TAT and high TAT/PAP ratio. In addition, both TAT and PAP were markedly elevated in patients with shock.

To address this issue, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to RII beta antisense synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, and the effects on cAMP-induced growth regulation were examined. Exposure of these cells to RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide resulted in a decrease in cAMP analog-induced growth inhibition and differentiation without apparent effect on differentiation induced by phorbol esters. This loss in cAMP growth regulatory function correlated with a decrease in basal and induced levels of RII beta protein.

Twenty-seven patients received symptomatic or palliative treatment only because combination chemotherapy was considered inappropriate. Eighty-eight patients received intensive chemotherapy with curative intent. There was a 48 per cent 'early death' rate and a 24 per cent incidence of resistant disease; complete remission (CR) was achieved in 25/88 patients (28 per cent). By multivariate analysis, a blast count less than 50 x 10(9)/l at presentation was the only factor predictive for achievement of CR whilst the latter and a presentation blast count less than 50 x 10(9)/l predicted for superior survival. Treatment was often curtailed on account of unacceptable toxicity; only 2/88 patients received the planned six cycles of treatment. Two patients died in CR. Four patients are alive in first CR at 3-9 years from treatment; one is alive in second CR following meningeal relapse. Overall survival was significantly worse than that of a contemporaneous group of adults aged 15-59 years treated at this hospital, but duration of CR was comparable.

Moreover, comparative studies with NAO and rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) prove that acridine orange-derivative uptake is independent of transmembrane mitochondrial potential, a property allowing its utilization for the assessment of mitochondrial membrane mass modifications under various physiological states. Using NAO and Rh 123, we have respectively followed the biosynthesis of mitochondrial membrane and its assembly under a functional state during the L1210 cell cycle. Their evolution occurs in two stages according to a well-defined sequential order. Mitochondrial biogenesis, as revealed by NAO incorporation, occurs essentially in the G1 phase (probably mitochondrion enlargement) but also starts in late S phase (probably mitochondrion division). The increased amount of functional mitochondrial membrane, monitored by Rh 123 uptake, is emphasized in late G1 (prerequisite to DNA synthesis) and during G2M phases (prerequisite to mitosis). This alternative succession of phases displays the existence of a time-lag between the biosynthesis of mitochondrial membrane and its functional organization. Such an analysis confirms the potential of the NAO probe to evaluate mitochondrial membrane mass changes in various biological fields.","['0014-4827(90)90219-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(90)90219-z [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

These hybrids segregated the provirus-containing rearranged alleles from the normal nonrearranged alleles of Mlvi-4 and Mlvi-1, and they carried an intact copy of rat Myc.

The observations were made in all HLTBMCs established with normal as well as myelomatous bone marrow (BM). Plasma cells with long extensions were also noticed on May-Grunwald-Giemsa smears of original uncultured BM from normal individuals and patients with myelomatous disorders.

Blast cells from 11 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were incubated with recombinant TNF alpha or TNF beta in serum-free 3H-TdR uptake and colony culture systems in the presence or absence of recombinant interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, or M-CSF. Depending on the supplemented CSF, TNF could upregulate or suppress AML blast proliferation. Enhancement of AML growth by TNF was observed in the presence of IL-3 (in 9 of 11 cases in 3H-TdR assay; 6 of 9 cases in colony assay) and GM-CSF (in 8 of 11 cases in 3H-TdR assay; 4 of 9 cases in colony assay). In certain cases in which IL-3 or GM-CSF alone was unable to induce proliferative responses of AML cells, the simultaneous addition of TNF elicited colony growth and DNA synthesis suggesting a synergistic action between TNF and IL-3 or GM-CSF. In contrast, TNF suppressed G-CSF-induced growth (9 of 10 cases in 3H-TdR assay; 5 of 6 cases in colony assay). TNF could also stimulate DNA synthesis (in 2 of 11 cases) or colony formation (in 2 of 9 cases) in AML cultures without the addition of other growth factors. Experiments with neutralizing antibodies and specific radioimmunoassays for individual CSFs showed that the synergistic and antagonistic effects of TNF on AML growth could not be attributed to a release of one of these CSFs by the AML cells. The opposing consequence of exposure of AML blasts to TNF are of interest in view of our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML growth and the in vivo application of recombinant cytokines in AML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This B cell leukemia is distinctive in that high proportions of patients have leukemic cells that express sIg bearing one or more crossreactive idiotypes (CRIs) that commonly are found on IgM autoantibodies. We performed immunohistochemical studies on fetal spleen at 23 wk of gestation using a panel of mAbs specific for autoantibody-associated CRIs. We find that high proportions (5-17%) of the lymphocytes within each follicle react with any one of the anti-CRI mAbs. Furthermore, there is little variation between primary follicles in the proportions of cells that express a particular CRI. Using a cocktail of four anti-CRI mAbs, we detect autoantibody-associated CRIs on approximately one-third of the lymphocytes within each of the primary B cell follicles. These data indicate that the many of the Igs produced during early B cell development may be structurally related to IgM autoantibodies and to Ig expressed in CLL and related CD5 B cell malignancies.

The eosinophilic differentiation and proliferation of leukemic cells were also observed in the liquid culture system.

Leukemic cells also differentiated to neutrophils or both neutrophils and eosinophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, respectively, but did not respond noticeably to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Although IL-5 acts on normal eosinophil committed precursors as a lineage-specific growth factor, at least some leukemic cells reacted to IL-5 and could proliferate and differentiate along eosinophilic pathway.

Pretreatment of cells with G-CSF or GM-CSF for more than 30 seconds before permeabilization rendered the p75 labeling undetectable, suggesting that ligand-stimulated labeling was rapidly completed within this time in intact cells. Phosphorylation of p75 occurred on serine and tyrosine residues. This conclusion was confirmed by direct phosphoamino acid analysis. Immunoblot analysis of lysates of intact HL60 cells that had been incubated with G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN, or TNF confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a p75 also occurred in response to these cytokines in intact cells. Pretreatment of intact HL60 cells with one biologic agent or dimethyl sulfoxide abolished p75 labeling in response to incubation of permeabilized cells with a second agent, strongly suggesting that the same protein was phosphorylated in response to these treatments. p75 labeling was strictly dependent on expression of the appropriate ligand receptor. Data suggest that activation of a tyrosine kinase system is an early response to the binding of G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, or IFN to their respective cell surface receptors, or to the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, and that the resulting phosphorylation event(s) may play a role in securing common elements in the biologic responses to these agents.",['S0006-4971(20)85822-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Overall event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 43% (SE = 4%). Factors examined included white blood cell (WBC) level, age, gender, race (black v other), presence of a mediastinal mass, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, marked lymphadenopathy, hemoglobin level, platelet count, blast cell expression of antigens such as the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA, CD10), HLA-DR, and T-cell-associated antigens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD5, and THY). Univariate analysis showed that age less than or equal to 5 or less than or equal to 7 years, WBC level less than 10, less than 25, less than 50 or less than 100 x 10(3)/microL, and blast cell expression of CD4, CD8, or CALLA were associated with significantly better EFS, while hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were associated with worse EFS. Recursive partitioning analysis showed that the most important single favorable prognostic factor was a WBC level less than 50 x 10(3)/microL and, for patients with WBC counts below this level, the most important predictor of EFS was blast cell expression of the pan-T antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody (MoAb), L17F12 (CD5). For patients with higher WBC levels, the most important predictor of EFS was blast cell expression of THY antigen.

Their bactericidal effect has been attributed to their capacity to interact with lipid bilayer membranes. We observed histamine release by magainin-2 amide from rat peritoneal mast cells (ED50 = 13 micrograms/ml) but not from human basophils. This histamine-releasing reaction from peritoneal mast cells was due to a secretory rather than cytolytic effect, i.e., release occurred without concomitant liberation of lactic dehydrogenase. Furthermore, the pretreatment of mast cells with magainin-2 amide did not desensitize cells against subsequent challenge with other secretagogues. Maximum histamine release occurred in less than a minute at 25 and 37 degrees C. The addition of Ca2+ was not required for histamine release, although release was enhanced by the addition of 0.3-1 mM Ca2+. The addition of 3 mM Ca2+ or Mg2+ was markedly inhibitory. The presence of Na+ or Cl- ions in the medium was not required for release. Therefore, histamine release is not due to the formation of anion-selective channels in the membrane of mast cells. The results indicated that the characteristics of histamine secretion induced by magainin-2 amide were unlike IgE-mediated release but were similar to the mechanism of release attributed to some other basic peptides and to compound 48/80.",['10.3181/00379727-193-42989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Three of the six cases showed that delayed addition of G-CSF to agar culture initiated by GM-CSF had no influence on the type and number of colonies; whereas, delayed addition of GM-CSF to G-CSF resulted in additional GM colonies. These findings were the same for normal bone marrow progenitors. In two cases, granulocytic colonies markedly increased with delayed addition of G-CSF to GM-CSF. Synergism occurred in one case where GM-CSF was used first. In the next experiment, regardless of whether CSF was used during the 48 hour preincubation, subsequent colony types were affected by the CSF used in agar culture. But colony numbers increased 1.5 fold in two of six cases by preincubation with GM-CSF, and 1.2 to 1.7 fold in all normal cases by preincubation with G-CSF.

In this study, we provide evidence that receptors of these two viruses exist independently on the target cell. We established an HTLV-I-producing CD8+ T cell line (ILT-8M2) with a remarkable cell fusion capacity. When cocultured with MOLT-4 cells, ILT-8M2 cells induced giant syncytia more efficiently than any other tested HTLV-I-producer cell lines. In contrast to other HTLV-I-producers, ILT-8M2 cells were minimally susceptible to cytopathic effects of HIV-1 due to very low expression of CD4, although they were able to be persistently infected by HIV-1. The indicator MOLT-4 cells are known to respond well to HIV-1-induced cell fusion, but they lose this ability if they become persistently infected with HIV-1 because of the reduction of CD4 receptor expression. ILT-8M2 was, however, still capable of inducing syncytia with the MOLT-4 cells persistently infected by HIV-1 (MOLT-4/IIIB). This syncytium formation was dependent on the HTLV-I-envelope, as it was inhibited by HTLV-I-positive human sera or a monoclonal antibody to HTLV-I gp46 but not by monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 gp120 or CD4. Moreover, ILT-8M2 cells persistently infected by HIV-1 (ILT-8M2/IIIB) induced both HTLV-I- and HIV-1-mediated syncytia with uninfected MOLT-4 cells. These results suggest that HTLV-I induces cell fusion utilizing receptors on the target cells independent of HIV-1-receptors.",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1991.tb01606.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced DNA repair has been observed in several cases, but, to date, few cell lines have been adequately investigated for such changes. These observations demonstrate that multiple mechanisms of resistance exist, and often several may occur in the same cell line.

HTLV infection is associated with a malignant form of adult T-cell leukemia, tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and an associated myelopathy (HAM). The pathogenic mechanisms of HTLV are as yet poorly understood. HIV infection is spreading rapidly almost world-wide and has reached epidemic proportions in Central Africa, parts of South America and in certain populations in industrialized countries that have risk behaviour for contracting venereal or blood-borne infections. The mechanisms of HIV-induced immune suppression are still not entirely clear, as direct T-lymphocyte destruction after viral infection cannot account for the almost complete loss of CD4 T-cells in the final stages of disease. Various indirect mechanisms of HIV-induced immune cell destruction are outlined below.",,,,,,,,8,,,,

Following leukemia induction, the mice were given 9.5 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) and injected with mixed marrow and spleen cells from normal MHC-matched--but minor histocompatibility mismatched--B10.S donors. Prior to their injection these donor cells were selectively depleted ex vivo for either CD4, CD8 or Thy-1 by exposure to the appropriate monoclonal antibody (MoAb) plus complement. Following transplant the recipients were observed for 20 weeks, along with parallel control groups, for survival, leukemia relapse, graft failure and graft-versus-host disease; 98% of the controls receiving no transplantation therapy died of leukemia. Among the controls that received TBI plus undepleted B10.S cells 30.9% died of leukemia relapse, but another 34.2% survived free of any clinical evidence of their leukemia. Donor cell depletion for Thy-1 increased the relapse to 68.8%, while survival fell to 10.4%. CD8 depletion resulted in a relapse of 55.6%, with a survival of 19.4%. By contrast, CD4 depletion had no effect on relapse, but did significantly increase the incidence of graft failure. At the end of the 20 weeks additional tests were run to determine whether those transplant survivors that had remained leukemia-free were also free of any residual Rauscher virus. Those tests showed that they were not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,"['1-R01-AI28425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5-R01-CA49437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Automated blood cell separators are usually designed for collection of blood components from healthy donors. We reviewed safety and efficiency of collection data of a new procedure for the Fenwal CS 3000 blood cell separator in 125 collections from normal donors and 101 collections from patients after IL-2 pretreatment or chemotherapy. The new procedure set red blood cell spillovers to occur at 3.5 minute intervals, using procedure 1 with the interface detector set at 1,000 and the standard granulocyte and collection chambers. Despite significant anemia and thrombocytopenia in a large number of patients no serious procedure-related side effects occurred. The lymphocyte yield was 4.74 +/- 1.6 x 10(9) per 5 liters of blood processed in normal donors and 24.2 +/- 12.0 x 10(9) per 10 liters of blood processed after IL-2 treatment. After chemotherapy the lymphocyte yield was 4.5 +/- 3.1 x 10(9) per 10 liters of blood processed; the collection efficiency was found to be significantly lower in this group. The main problem was the platelet loss of 35.6 +/- 12% of the initial count in normal donors, 40.3 +/- 14.1% after IL-2 treatment, and 42.1 +/- 18.0% after chemotherapy. The platelet loss is, however, closely related to the preapheresis platelet count; patients with thrombocytopenia lose fewer platelets than normal donors. Therefore the procedure was found to be safe for patients with a platelet count as low as 20/nl.

Hsc harvesting (marrow or peripheral blood) is performed during complete remission and is cryo-preserved in liquid nitrogen. The HSC graft, infused after treatment intensification, results in a rapidly occurring hematopoietic reconstitution. As the graft is potentially contaminated by residual malignant cells, an ex-vivo treatment by chemical or immunological treatment can contribute to a reduction and maybe even a disappearance of the malignant population. The encouraging results seen after presently autologous transplantation concerns unfortunately only selected groups of patients (acute myeloid leukemia in particular). Progress in biotechnologies (hematopoietic growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, interleukin-2) now allow us to consider new therapeutic strategies and should contribute to improved clinical results after autologous transplantation.",,,,,,,,,Autogreffes de cellules souches hematopoietiques.

Thirteen of the 579 inhabitants (2.2%) were positive for anti-HCV, and this prevalence rate was not significantly different from the frequency of anti-HCV in Tokyo blood donors. A total of 11% (64 of 579) of the subjects were positive for HBsAg and 3.3% (19 of 579) were positive for anti-HTLV.

In THP-1 cells, ethanol had no significant effect on PCA in either non-challenged or LPS-induced status.

In U937 cells, n-alcohols and anesthetics resulted in dose-dependent depressions in PCA.

The nature of in vivo target cell depletion by toxin conjugates is largely unknown. The anti-murine Thy1.1 antibody-diphtheria toxin conjugate possesses high in vitro efficacy, and because mice are remarkably resistant to the native toxin, the conjugate possesses in vivo efficacy. When administered intravenously, the conjugate is shown to deplete peripheral blood Thy1.1+ target cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. When the log kill of Thy1.1+ tumor cells was analyzed by the life span extension method, it was determined, however, that the log kill is inversely proportional to the number of target cells. That is, the presence of an endogenous cell population, which is expressing the same surface antigen targeted by the antibody conjugate as on the pathological cell, may drastically lower the clinical efficacy of the immunotoxin. Thus, the greatest potential for antibody-toxin conjugates will be for low target cell burdens and for pathogenic cell populations expressing unique surface antigens. These are important considerations in the design of bioconjugates to insure high in vivo efficacy in elimination of intended target cells.",['10.1021/bc00010a003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All four patients had received a T-cell depleted graft. Onset of the first clinical symptoms (palpable lymph node enlargement in three and IgA-lambda paraproteinemia in two patients) occurred between 41 and 188 days post-BMT (median 76 days). The course of the LPS was rapidly progressive in all cases, leading to death in 2-5 weeks. The peripheral blood showed progressive pancytopenia with disproportionally high numbers of activated NK cells, apparently compensating for the T-cell deficiency. Post-mortem histological studies disclosed polymorphic B-cell proliferations, most pronounced in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lungs and kidneys. Lymphohemopoietic cells were of donor origin in three patients. In the fourth patient, graft failure suggested a host origin for the proliferating cells. Immunophenotyping and gene rearrangement analysis revealed polyclonal proliferation in one patient, monoclonal proliferation in another patient, and an oligoclonal pattern in the other two patients. The clinical behavior of the LPS was independent of clonality. Immunohistologically, the proliferating cells showed characteristics of relatively mature B-cells in three cases, and pre-B-cell features in one case. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) serology indicated seroconversion (primary infection) in one child, and chronic active EBV infection in both adults. EBV DNA as well as EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) were detected in infiltrated tissues of all four patients. The labeling pattern on in situ hybridization suggested a replicative EBV infection comparable to that in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We conclude that EBV-associated LPS developing as a result of post-transplant immunodeficiency is a distinct clinicopathologic entity, differing from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (including Burkitt's lymphoma) and infectious mononucleosis of the immunocompetent host.",['10.1007/BF02899562 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

H-8, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, inhibited the growth of the parental P388 murine leukaemic cells, but not that of MDR variants up to 200 microM. However the growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant cell lines were uniformly inhibited by H-7. Both the cytotoxic and cytokinetic results revealed that the growth-inhibition by H-8 of P388 cells is mainly due to a blockade of cell-cycle progression rather than due to a killing of cells. The degree of resistance to H-8 was directly proportional to their extent of resistance to vincristine, adriamycin, and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-ethylidene)-beta-D-gluco pyr anoside (VP-16) and to that of the expression of P-glycoprotein. These findings raised the possibility that P-glycoprotein might play a role in the cross-resistance to H-8. To test the hypothesis, we examined the effect of H-8 on the binding of 3H-vincristine to membrane fraction isolated from P388/VCR-600 cells and on the enhancement of cytotoxicity to anticancer drugs in MDR cells. H-8 did not have any influences on these reactions. Thus, the cross-resistance to H-8 may be mediated through a mechanism different from an overexpression of P-glycoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['10.1038/bjc.1991.472 [doi]'],PMC1977858,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with SM-108 induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. During a 6-day culture with 100 microM SM-108, the cell number decreased to 37% of the control number, 77% of the cells became benzidine-positive, and the hemoglobin content increased from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 10.6 +/- 1.3 pg/cell. Cell differentiation was associated with reduction of IMP dehydrogenase activity and intracellular GTP content to 25 and 36%, respectively, of the control values within 1.5 hr. The differentiation and decrease in the GTP pool induced by SM-108 were blocked by the presence of 25 microM guanine or guanosine. SM-108 also induced erythroid differentiation of K562 subline cells transfected with pMSG (K562/pMSG), which have an additional salvage pathway for GMP production from xanthine. The addition of 100 microM xanthine prevented erythroid differentiation of this subline and restored the GTP pool. These findings suggest that the induction of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells by SM-108 may be due to an early decrease in IMP dehydrogenase activity and a subsequent decrease in GTP content in the cells. Thus, purine metabolism may have an important role in SM-108-induced differentiation.","['0006-2952(91)90234-V [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90234-v [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

This is the major contributing factor to its being the target of the first oncogene-based FDA-approved diagnostic test. Although the role of the abl translocation in the tumorigenic process is not yet understood, it is clear that somehow it must be causally related to the disease, and thus is an ideal target for a diagnostic test. The association of this oncogene with a specific cancer is the model on which all others may be based in the future. Second generation tests could easily include PCR on mRNA, and/or in situ hybridization, both of which could be performed using blood samples. Both methods would provide a faster means of testing a large number of cells, however, the methodologies must be improved through automation and computer-aided image analysis, respectively, in order to become useful routine tests. Both neu and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) appear to have a close correlation between overexpression of the gene product and outcome of disease in breast cancer; valuable information for prognosis of the disease. And again, although the actual mechanism of action of these molecules and how this relates to the tumorigenic process is not yet known, it is believed from the very nature of the molecules that they must in some way contribute to the progression of the disease. In both cases, the protein products are overexpressed in tissue, and in the case of Neu, it appears as through at least some of the patients have a Neu-related protein in their serum. These molecules present relatively easy targets for the development of diagnostic/prognostic assays, as antibodies are easily made and can be incorporated into a variety of assay formats. Current assays available, an ELISA for Neu and a radio-ligand binding assay for EGFR, are highly sensitive, reproducible and relatively easy to perform. Only the ELISA is commercially available, however, and hence allows for easy comparison between laboratories. An abvious step towards the routine measurement of EGFR then is the development of a comparable commercially available test. An improvement for both types of assay would be the incorporation of an internal control to gauge the cellular component of the tissue samples that are tested. The outcome of the applications of myc and ras to cancer diagnostics is not so easily predictable, with a couple of exceptions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['0304-419X(91)90014-C [pii]', '10.1016/0304-419x(91)90014-c [doi]']",,,,"['L-myc', 'N-myc', 'Neu', 'c-abl', 'c-myc', 'myc', 'ras']",,,310,,,,

We used X-ray irradiation and cell fusion to generate a panel of 102 hamster-human somatic cell hybrids containing fragments of human chromosome 11. Sixteen human loci in the 11q12-13 region were mapped by statistical analysis of the cosegregation of markers in these radiation hybrids. The most likely order for these loci is C1NH-OSBP-(CD5/CD20)-PGA-FTH1-COX8-PYGM -SEA-KRN1-(MTC/P11EH/HSTF1/INT2)-GST3- PPP1A. Our localization of the human protooncogene SEA between PYGM and INT2, two markers that flank MEN-1, suggests SEA as a potential candidate for the MEN-1 locus. We map two mitogenic fibroblast growth factor genes, HSTF1 and INT2, close to bcl-1, a mapping that is consistent with previously published data. Our map places the human leukocyte antigen genes CD5 and CD20 far from the bcl-1 locus, indicating that CD5 and CD20 expression is unlikely to be altered by bcl-1 rearrangements. PPP1A, which has been postulated as a MEN-1 candidate tumor suppressor gene, and GST3, a gene transcriptionally active in many human cancers, both map distal to the bcl-1 translocation cluster and the region containing MEN-1, and therefore are unlikely to be directly involved in bcl-1 or MEN-1.",,PMC1686449,,['MH00802/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['C1NH', 'CD20', 'CD5', 'COX8', 'FTH1', 'GST3', 'HSTF1', 'INT2', 'KRN1', 'OSBP', 'PGA', 'PPP1A', 'PYGM', 'SEA', 'bcl-1 MTC', 'bcl-1 P11EH']",,,,,,,

Cells that had been equilibrium-labelled with [2-3H]myo-inositol contained a complex pattern of inositol metabolites, several of which were at relatively high concentrations. These included InsP5 and InsP6, which were present at concentrations of about 25 microM and 60 microM, respectively. Striking and different changes occurred in the levels of some of the inositol polyphosphates as the cells differentiated towards either neutrophils or monocytes. Most notable were a large but gradual accumulation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 as HL60 cells decreased in size and acquired neutrophil characteristics, and much more rapid and sequential declines in InsP4, InsP5 and InsP6 as the cells started to take on monocyte character. There was a marked accumulation of free inositol and of phosphatidylinositol in the cells during neutrophil differentiation, probably caused at least in part by an increased rate of inositol uptake providing an increased intracellular inositol supply. The same accumulation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 occurred during neutrophil differentiation, whether it was induced by dimethylsulphoxide or by a combination of retinoic acid and a T-lymphocyte cell line-derived differentiation factor. Ins(1,4,5)P3, a physiological intracellular mediator of Ca2+ release from membrane stores, did not change in concentration during these differentiation processes. These observations suggest that some of the more abundant cellular inositol polyphosphates play some important, but not yet understood, role either in the processes of haemopoietic differentiation or in the expression of differentiated cell character in myeloid cells.",['10.1098/rspb.1991.0109 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A 30-fold-resistant subline to CB3717 was selected from the TMQ-resistant cells and designated as MOLT-3/TMQ200-CB371730. This double-folate-resistant cell line was 15-fold more resistant to methotrexate (MTX) than MOLT-3/TMQ200; however, TMQ resistance was decreased to 10-fold as compared to MOLT-3/TMQ200. The doubly resistant cells also showed 2-fold cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Equimolar concentrations of leucovorin almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of MTX on the doubly resistant cells and partially that of CB3717 and TMQ; on the other hand, leucovorin enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-FU. Thymidylate synthase activities demonstrated little or no difference among these three cell lines, being consistent with no overexpression of mRNA for this enzyme in the doubly resistant cells. MOLT-3/TMQ200 cells displayed classical multidrug resistance; sequential development of CB3717 resistance in the TMQ-resistant cells resulted in an enhancement of the multidrug-resistance phenotype and a concomitant increase of MDR1 mRNA. The development of a complex resistance pattern seen in this double-folate-resistant subline indicates intricacy in the study of drug resistance after multidrug chemotherapy.",['10.1007/BF01613282 [doi]'],,,['CA-15936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The decrease in lactate accumulation occurred as early as 24 h after inducer treatment was initiated and occurred prior to the decrease in glucose utilization. The decrease in lactate accumulation was greater than that predicted by the decrease in glucose utilization, i.e., the ratio of glucose used glycolytically, as measured by lactate accumulation, to glucose used in other pathways ('glycolytic ratio') markedly decreased during differentiation in these cell lines. Differentiation correlated with the abrogation of the high levels of lactate accumulation first described by Warburg as characteristic of some transformed and neoplastic cells. Studies on both parental and differentiation-resistant variant MEL cell lines indicated that the changes in lactate accumulation were not dependent on the changes in glucose utilization and could be dissociated from them. Moreover, the changes in lactate accumulation only occurred in cells able to undergo differentiation-induced terminal cell division. This regulatable expression of lactate accumulation in MEL and HL-60 cells in vitro may make them useful model systems for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling lactate formation in malignant cells.","['S0301-4681(11)60280-6 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00242.x [doi]']",,,['T35DK07420-10/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In selected cases Rb protein expression was examined with specific monoclonal antibodies. Structural abnormalities of the Rb gene with absent protein expression were frequent in all types of human acute leukemia, but were particularly common (27% incidence) in M4 and M5 myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation and in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemia of lymphoid phenotype (11% to 29% incidence). Changes in Rb were observed early in the transition to acute leukemia in cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and in the accelerated phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia in transition to blast crisis. In one case, molecular changes in Rb could be correlated with leukemia remission and relapse.

Analysis of purified cell suspensions of four of these patients showed that both myeloid and lymphoid cells were of monoclonal origin, indicating the involvement of an early stem cell. The four patients who were studied at presentation all showed a monoclonal pattern. One of these patients showed a spontaneous recovery despite persistent clonal hematopoiesis. The presence of either clonal or polyclonal hematopoiesis did not show a correlation with the response to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment. A relapse after ATG was also seen in a patient exhibiting polyclonal hematopoiesis. Conversely, a monoclonal pattern did not preclude the occurrence of a partial or complete response to ATG. Other potential markers to study clonality, including cytogenetic abnormalities or point mutations of the N-ras protooncogene, were not found in any of the patients.

Using probes to sequences flanking the integration sites in 129 mice, unique genomic Eco RI fragments were assigned to each of the four endogenous proviral elements. Analyses revealed that certain of these proviral elements are present both in strains closely related to strain 129 (i.e., strains 101 and LP/J) and in more distantly related strains (i.e., strains BALB/cJ, A/J, and C3H/HeJ). In mouse strains lacking proviral integration at a particular locus, the size of the corresponding Eco RI genomic fragment and absence of a characteristic Kpn I site indicated the lack of a residual solitary long terminal repeat. Hybridization of oligonucleotide probes that distinguish the specific deletions present within these elements identified additional analogous proviral integrations at many different sites in all strains investigated. These data indicate that the diversification of these proviral elements found in inbred strains is generated by integration of new copies, rather than excision through homologous recombination.

Lymphocyte counts, and proportions of T and B-cells returned to normal ranges between the 2nd and 12th months after BMT. Activated T-cells prominently increased after BMT, and the values gradually returned toward normal. As to lymphocyte subsets, the proportions of CD 4+ cells had remained low, while those of CD 8+ cells high for a whole observation period after BMT. The changes of CD 4+ cells were caused by the decrease of suppressor-inducer T-cells (CD 4+ Leu 8+). High proportion of CD 8+ cells was mainly associated with increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8+ CD 11+). Among natural killer (NK) cells, highly active NK cells (CD 16+ CD 57-) markedly increased shortly after BMT, and gradually returned to normal. CD 16 -CD 57+ NK cells increased beyond normal ranges after the 2nd month. The incidence or degree of acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) did not correlate with the changes of any lymphocyte subsets. The present results suggest that the increase of activated T-cells shortly after BMT reflects lymphocyte reconstitution. The prolonged immune deficiency after BMT might be related to either deficient expression of homing receptor (Leu 8 antigen) on CD 4+ cells or increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8+ CD 11+). In addition, the early increase of NK cells after BMT may compensate for the immune deficiency in BMT patients.",['10.18926/AMO/32173 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The biopsy specimens were classified histologically prior to morphometry, according to the Hannover Classification of CMPD. Five histological groups were investigated, evaluating between 21 and 30 biopsies in each group. The five groups were as follows: (1) Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) of common type (CML.CT), (2) CML with megakaryocytic increase (CML.MI), (3) polycythemia vera (P. vera), (4) primary thrombocythemia (PTH), and (5) chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis (CMGM). The results of five variables, i.e. the cellular and nuclear size, the cellular and nuclear form factor, and nuclear segmentation, were determined in at least 50 MK per BMB. The results reveal significant differences in MK nuclear and cellular size, as well as in nuclear segmentation between CML and the three other groups in that the nuclear and cellular size of the MK in CML are smaller than in P. vera, PTH, and CMGM. Moreover, the degree of nuclear segmentation or lobulation differs significantly between the three disorders characterized by large MK. Discriminant analysis permits 78-100% reliability of reclassification by morphometry compared with the histologic classification. A reduced reliability of the morphometric classification to around 80% was found between P. vera and PTH, as well as between P. vera and CMGM. In the design of this study, morphometry of MK lends added weight to the subjective classification of these disorders.",['10.1007/BF02890412 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The CD11 molecules and the common CD18 are the products of different genes that exhibit distinct though overlapping patterns of tissue- and developmental-specific expression. Whereas expression of CD11b and CD11c is almost exclusively restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage, that of CD11a and CD18 is panleukocytic. To begin to understand the mechanisms by which expression of these gene products is restricted to leukocytes and leukocyte subpopulations and to elucidate the mechanisms by which their expression is coordinated, we have cloned and characterized the promoter region of the CD11b gene. A single transcription initiation site has been identified and the region extending 242 base pairs upstream and 71 base pairs downstream of this site has been shown to be sufficient to direct tissue-, cell-, and development-specific expression in vitro, which mimics that of the CD11b gene in vivo. Within this region there are potential binding sites for transcription factors known to be involved in hematopoietic-specific and phorbol ester-inducible gene expression. Further analysis of this region of the CD11b gene and comparison with the promoters of the CD11a, CD11c, and CD18 genes should lead to significant insights into the molecular mechanisms by which these genes are regulated during hematopoietic development and upon activation.",['10.1073/pnas.88.23.10525 [doi]'],PMC52961,,['P01 AI 28465/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['GENBANK/M76724', 'GENBANK/M80721', 'GENBANK/M80722', 'GENBANK/M80723', 'GENBANK/M80724', 'GENBANK/M81136', 'GENBANK/M81137', 'GENBANK/M81138', 'GENBANK/M81139', 'GENBANK/S70693']",,,,,

Probes from one integration site (His-1) defined a region that was rearranged in 3/52 cell lines, and probes from a second integration site (His-2) identified a rearrangement in 2/52 cell lines. Both cases of His-2 rearrangements occurred in concert with viral insertions in the His-1 locus. Genetic mapping of these loci using interspecific backcross analysis assigned the His-1 locus to mouse chromosome 2 and the His-2 locus to mouse chromosome 19. In situ hybridization with a probe from the human homologous region mapped the His-1 locus to human chromosome 2q14-q21. No recombinants were observed between His-2 and Gin-1, a common site of provirus integration in Gross passage A MuLV-induced T-cell leukemias, in 131 backcross animals, suggesting that these loci are tightly linked.

Because there are insufficient data to define 20 x 10(9)/l as the threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions, the practicability of a more restrictive transfusion policy has been assessed prospectively in 102 consecutive patients being treated for acute leukaemia. Besides platelet count, the transfusion protocol took into consideration factors such as presence of bleeding, fever, coagulation disorders, and intention to do therapeutic procedures. 31 major bleeding episodes occurred on 1.9% of the study days when platelet counts were 10 x 10(9)/l or less and on 0.07% of study days when counts were 10-20 x 10(9)/l. The findings indicate that the threshold for prophylactic transfusions can safely be set at 5 x 10(9)/l in patients without fever or bleeding manifestations and at 10 x 10(9)/l in patients with such signs. For patients with coagulation disorders or anatomical lesions, or for those on heparin, the threshold should be at least 20 x 10(9)/l. Such a restrictive platelet transfusion policy, which is applicable not only to thrombocytopenia associated with acute leukaemia but also to other forms of hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, reduces exposure of such patients to blood donors and results in substantial health-care savings.","['0140-6736(91)92098-M [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(91)92098-m [doi]']",,['Lancet. 1992 Jan 11;339(8785):120; author reply 120-1.

Morphological, histochemical, ultrastructural, immunological, and genotypic studies confirmed a clonal proliferation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-negative CD5-CD10-CD25- and CD11c+ B-cells. In addition to CD11c, these cells expressed other adhesion receptors (LFA-1/CD11a, VLA-4/CD29/49d, ICAM-1/CD54, and LAM-1) and produced detectable amounts of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and in one case tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA. This monoclonal villous lymphocytosis (MVL) could be differentiated from B-cell chronic lymphocytic, prolymphocytic, and hairy cell leukaemias, and from previously recognized CD11c+ chronic B-cell leukaemia. A rare splenomegalic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma variant with circulating villous B-lymphocytes (SLVL), usually CD10+ and sometimes CD11c- and TRAP+, appears to be a closely related disorder. In all three patients the lymphocyte count increased very slowly, at a rate less than 5 x 10(9)/l per year, over 3-7.5 years of follow up, and a moderate splenomegaly eventually developed in one of the patients. Chemotherapy was never required. MVL may be a relatively benign clinical entity akin to SLVL within the group of CD11c+ B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, recombinant DNA technology has also been applied to determine engraftment status. In order to establish the relative utility of these methods in clinical practice we have directly compared the data from cytogenetic and recombinant DNA methods, evaluating engraftment status in 68 BMT recipients. Patients were evaluated pre-transplant, 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after BMT, and yearly thereafter for 1) the presence or absence of the Y chromosome in sex-mismatched allogeneic transplant recipients, 2) the presence or absence of the Philadelphia chromosome [t(9;22)] in patients transplanted for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 3) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles, and/or 4) clonal rearrangement of the bcr gene. Cytogenetic examination of unstimulated bone marrow and recombinant DNA tests of nucleated peripheral blood or bone marrow cells produce qualitatively similar data in the identification of patient and donor cells and/or normal and tumor cells. Differences in the results obtained by the two analytic methods were most often due to the restricted cell populations evaluable by cytogenetic studies of PHA-stimulated peripheral blood specimens. DNA analyses could frequently be applied at earlier intervals after transplantation and, in cases of graft rejection, when cell counts were low. Although recombinant DNA methods required fewer cells and demonstrated greater sensitivity in detection of minor cell populations in the majority of instances, the cytogenetic evaluation may complement the DNA studies and allow detection of additional chromosomal anomalies.","['0165-4608(91)90076-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90076-7 [doi]']",,,"['CA 06973-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15396-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['bcr'],,,,,,,

We used flow cytometry to examine the variability of CD15 expression in normal cells and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells as detected by 24 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Important differences in the levels of binding were observed with the various mAb. Titrations of each mAb were performed to confirm that these differences in binding were due to increased antigen detection and not differences in concn. In studies of CD15 expression on AML cells selected from a large prospective study, anti-CD15-1 (also known as PM-81) showed the highest binding to each case. Neuraminidase was added to cells from seven AML patients that we had previously found to be low in CD15 expression, in order to determine if cryptic CD15 was present on these cells. Neuraminidase enhanced binding of each of the entire panel of mAb on five patients' cells, thus demonstrating the ubiquitous expression of CD15 on AML cells. In two cases, binding of only some of the mAb was increased, indicating exposure of unusual epitopes on those cells. Subpopulations of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, cells not associated with CD15 expression, also substantially increased their level of binding to some of the mAb after the addition of neuraminidase. Two-color flow cytometry was used to determine the immunologic phenotype of the lymphocytic population that expressed CD15. This technique revealed that 9.5% normal lymphocytes coexpressed the CD15 and CD3 (T cell) antigens. In addition, by gating on large granular lymphocytes we found that 24.4% of these cells coexpressed CD15 (detected by PM-81) and CD2 (sheep erythrocyte receptor), while 50.3% expressed CD15 and CD16 (type III Fc receptor, natural killer cell-associated). This is consistent with the notion that sialylated CD15 is expressed on some natural killer cells and T cells.",['10.1016/0161-5890(91)90180-r [doi]'],,,"['CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This oncogene differs from the proto-oncogene c-erbB, the avian homolog of the epidermal growth factor receptor, by its lack of an intact ligand-binding domain as well as additional alterations in its cytoplasmic coding sequences. By contrast, the insertionally activated c-erbB, a variant oncogene, which encodes a product that also lacks the ligand-binding domain but is otherwise unaltered in its cytoplasmic coding sequences, is capable of inducing leukemia but cannot induce sarcomas. In this report, we show that the critical changes for activating the sarcomagenic potential displayed by v-erbB R are two point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain and an internal deletion of 21 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. The removal of the carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation sites is not obligatory. These activating mutations (Arg-263 to His, Ile-384 to Ser, and the deletion of residues 494 to 514), when introduced singly into the insertionally activated c-erbB, all dramatically increase fibroblast-transforming potential. Arg-263 resides near the highly conserved HRD motif of the kinase domain, and its mutation to His increases the autophosphorylation activity. The other two mutations do not alter the intrinsic kinase activity and presumably affect other aspects of the receptor involved in growth signaling. Therefore, the high transforming potential of v-erbB R is a consequence of synergism among multiple activating mutations.",['10.1128/JVI.65.11.6173-6180.1991 [doi]'],PMC250306,,"['CA39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA01199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['v-erbB'],,,,,,,

Screening of a phage library of tumor DNA with a probe for the beta T cell receptor gene (TCRB), which maps to chromosomal band 7q34, resulted in the isolation of a clone containing DNA spanning the translocation breakpoint of the der(1) chromosome. This clone contained chromosome 1 DNA juxtaposed upstream of a D beta-J beta joint. Cloning of the corresponding germline region of chromosome 1 resulted in the isolation of a phage containing the breakpoint from the reciprocal, der(7), product, which showed chromosome 1 DNA joined downstream to a V beta segment. Comparison of germline and translocation clones demonstrated that breakage of chromosome 1 had occurred at the border of a tandem repeat of Alu sequences. To search for transcripts from DNA near the breakpoint, a chromosomal walk was initiated along chromosome 1. A probe consisting of chromosome 1 DNA from 24-30 kb upstream of the breakpoint hybridized to a transcript derived from the gene encoding the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck, previously mapped to chromosomal band 1p34. The nonrandom nature of the breakpoints in this case was confirmed by the analysis of a second independent case of T-ALL containing a t(1;7) translocation, which was also found to show breakage within the LCK locus. The chromosomal breakpoint in the first case was localized 2 kb upstream of the lck upstream promoter and first nontranslated exon, while the breakpoint of the second case lay between the two alternative lck promoters, upstream of the second exon.

The most commonly used antineoplastic agents in the treatment of disseminated breast cancer are adriamycin, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Cell lines selected for resistance to adriamycin often develop cross-resistance to structurally dissimilar antineoplastic drugs with different mechanisms of cytotoxic action; this phenomenon has been called pleiotropic or multidrug resistance (MDR). In vitro models of MDR have shown that this type of resistance is accompanied by a decrease in cellular drug accumulation, mediated by the over-expression of a 170 kD plasma membrane glycoprotein referred to as P170. Glycoprotein P170 is an energy-dependent multidrug efflux pump, whose activity can be inhibited in vitro by a variety of agents including verapamil, quinidine and reserpine. P170 is over-expressed also in some human malignancies, and evidence exists about its role in examples of clinical resistance in vitro. Clinical trials using verapamil, a calcium channel blocker which selectively enhances drug cytotoxicity in MDR cell lines, have been prompted for leukemia and ovarian cancer. In addition other approaches are the subject of current preclinical investigations. Several observations as well the phenomenon of ""atypical"" MDR in cell lines which do not overexpress P170, suggest that also other factors are involved in multidrug resistance. Qualitative or quantitative changes in the activity of topoisomerases, protein kinase-related systems and glutathione S-transferase, may confer pleiotropic resistance. As the role of these genes and their regulation is clarified, they may also serve as useful targets for pharmacologic intervention in the treatment of drug-resistant human tumors. The mechanisms involved in resistance to methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are less studied, particularly in vivo samples. Methotrexate resistance is probably a complex multifactorial phenomenon; in some cases it is due to an increase in the expression of the drug target dihydrofolate reductase, often as a result of gene amplification, but in other cases a transport defect of the methotrexate or alterations of the activity of different enzymes have been reported. Cyclophosphamide (CP) resistance has been attributed to an increased activity of two different enzymes, glutathione S-transferase, also involved in MDR phenotype, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which catalyzes inactivation of CP in non cytotoxic metabolites. This paper reviews the current state of our knowledge of chemo-resistance and the utility of available markers to identify potentially resistant tumors in vivo; the strategies that might be used to overcome this phenomenon are also described.",,,,,,,,57,,,,

While many of these precursors might be committed cells with finite renewal capacity, ample evidence suggests that true pluripotent stem cells are circulating in a number sufficient to enable sustained trilineage engraftment after transplantation. Stem cell mobilization is markedly increased in the early recovery phase after intensive chemotherapy and can be promoted by the administration of various cytokines or polyanionic substances. These effects are used to optimize stem cell harvesting by leukapheresis.

In this report, we show that anti-HLA class I MoAbs induce DNA synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with a CD4+CD8+T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) and from a patient with a CD4-CD8+ T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL), in the absence of detectable additional mitogenic stimuli. Proliferation of leukemic T cells is induced by both whole Igs and Fab' fragments of anti-HLA class I MoAbs, arguing in favor of their direct interactions with the proliferating cells as the mechanism underlying the mitogenic effect. This interpretation is also supported by the ability of anti-HLA class I MoAbs to induce proliferation of leukemic T-cell preparations, depleted of accessory cells. DNA synthesis in T-CLL and T-PLL cells is preceded by expression of G1-specific messenger RNAs, ie. c-myc, 2F1, Tac, and interferon-gamma, in activated cells. Cell proliferation is inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7, indicating that activation of this enzyme is required for the mitogenic effect of anti-HLA class I MoAbs. The latter inhibit the proliferation of T-CLL cells as well as that of normal T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 MoAbs and enhance that of both types of cells stimulated with anti-CD2 MoAbs. In addition, anti-HLA class I MoAb Q6/64 in combination with anti-CD2 MoAb 9.6 or MoAb 9-1 induces proliferation of leukemic T cells to a greater extent than the individual MoAbs, but is not mitogenic for normal T cells. Anti-HLA class I MoAbs restore the cytolytic activity of T-CLL cells that is lost after 5 days of incubation of control medium, suggesting that HLA class I antigens may mediate a signal contributing to the activation state. The present results indicate that leukemic T-cell proliferation can be triggered via HLA class I molecules and suggest a potential role for these antigens in the in vivo growth of malignant clones.",['S0006-4971(20)82251-4 [pii]'],,,['CA39559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

At dose rates of approximately 0.05 Gy/min low-LET radiation the rate of induced single-strand damage equals that of the spontaneous damage, and in this region a transition, with increasing dose-rate, from constant effect to increasing effect, will be expected. This is observed in studies of specific locus mutation by radiation in the male mouse. The application of this biophysical principle governing the influence of radiation dose-rate, to the association observed between paternal preconceptional dose to Sellafield workers and childhood leukaemia in their offspring, shows that the likelihood of a causal relationship is extremely remote.","['KEKYE8D5QC0X8KVQ [pii]', '10.1080/09553009114552421 [doi]']",,['Int J Radiat Biol. 1992 May;61(5):565-6.

Both drug sensitive cell lines (HL-60/S, P388/S, KB3-1, and MCF-7/S) and drug-resistant cell lines (HL-60/AR, P388/ADR, KBV-1, and MCF-7/ADR) exposed to DNR showed a similar rapid distribution of drug from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region within the first 2 min. From 2-10 min, the drug sensitive HL-60/S, P388/S, and MCF-7/S cells redistributed drug to the nucleus and to the cytoplasm in a diffuse pattern. In contrast, drug-resistant HL-60/AR, P388/ADR, and MCF-7/ADR redistributed DNR from the perinuclear region into vesicles distinct from nuclear structures, thereby assuming a ""punctate"" pattern. This latter redistribution could be inhibited by glucose deprivation (indicating energy dependence), or by lowering the temperature of the medium below 18 degrees C. The differences in distribution between sensitive and resistant cells did not appear to be a function of intracellular DNR content, nor the result of drug cytotoxicity. Drug-sensitive KB3-1 and -resistant KBV-1 cells did not fully follow this pattern in that they demonstrated an intracellular DNR distribution intermediate between HL-60/S and HL-60/AR cells with both ""punctate"" and nuclear/cytoplasmic uptake sometimes in the same cell. These data indicate that the intracellular distribution of DNR is an important determinant of drug resistance regardless of the overexpression of P-glycoprotein.

It is obtained by semisynthesis from a noncytotoxic precursor extracted from the needles of the tree, Taxus baccata L. Taxotere was evaluated for antitumor activity against a variety of transplantable tumors of mice. Taxotere had no marked schedule dependency and was found active by the i.v. and the i.p. routes. Upon i.v. administration, 9 of 11 tumor models tested responded to Taxotere. B16 melanoma was found highly sensitive to Taxotere, with a tumor growth inhibition of 0% and a 3.0 log10 tumor cell kill at the maximum tolerated dose. In the same trial, taxol produced only a 1.1 log10 tumor cell kill at the maximum tolerated dose. Taxotere cured early stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 03 (6 of 6 cures) and colon adenocarcinoma 38 (7 of 7 cures). It also effected greater than 80% complete regressions of advanced stage disease with both tumors. Taxotere was active against early and advanced stage colon adenocarcinoma 51, with 2.3 and 1.7 log10 cell kill, respectively. Four other tumors responded to a lesser extent: Lewis lung (5.5% tumor growth inhibition), Glasgow osteogenic sarcoma (27.2% tumor growth inhibition), L1210 and P388 leukemias (70 and 54% increase in life span, respectively). Because of its good preclinical activity and its unique mechanism of action, Taxotere has entered Phase I clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seasonal variation reflects increased spore prevalence during periods of greater availability of non-viable matter. In hospital, airborne spores reflect incomplete filtration, infiltration of outside air and shedding of adherent spores from introduced objects. In highly protected hospital areas supplied with air filtered at high efficiency, where aspergillus cfus may be as low as 0.01 cfu m-3, infiltration and shedding contribute a high fraction of ambient spores. Nosocomial aspergillosis occurs in linear proportion to the mean ambient hospital airborne spore content. An analysis presuming a steady-state dynamic equilibrium is imperfect because repeated sampling produces occasional high counts which violate a Poisson distribution. 'Mini-bursts' arise from disturbance of settled spores in dust, shedding spores from clothes or other subtle sources. These sources are best mitigated by increasing the air change rate. It is most important to protect bone marrow transplant patients, leukaemia and lymphoma patients undergoing intensive, potentially curative therapy. The optimal protective environments include high filtration efficiency, point-of-use filters, protection against infiltration and filter bypass, elimination of in-hospital sources, and high air change rates.","['0195-6701(91)90058-G [pii]', '10.1016/0195-6701(91)90058-g [doi]']",,,,,,,24,,,,

This hypothesis, mainly established on B-cell clones of medullary origin, is consistent with the predominance of kappa chains among human serum immunoglobulins. However, data from tumors or normal lymphoid tissue suggest that lambda chain expression could be favored outside the bone marrow, due to an alternative rearrangement hierarchy.

The design of curative regimens against leukemia, lymphomas, testis cancer, and childhood malignancies is a tribute to the interactions between laboratory and clinical scientists. Laboratory models illustrated the importance of dose and the need for combinations to avoid the emergence of drug resistance in heterogeneous tumors. In addressing the incurability of common epithelial cancers in adults once disseminated, again laboratory models suggested that regimens which produced responses in advanced disease might be curative in patients with micro-metastases. Such proved to be the case in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer involving lymph nodes and for osteogenic sarcoma. Recent studies have extended this strategy to less advanced breast cancer and to locally advanced colon cancer. Lung cancer has required a different strategy. A coalition has developed to support the strongest possible public position against smoking. For the first time lung cancer incidence has leveled off in white males. Women and minorities continue to be a major target for smoking cessation programs. While large randomized trials are expensive (and to some scientists, unexciting), they are our most reliable means of detecting treatment differences of 10 to 15%. Because lung, breast, and colon cancer kill almost 250,000 Americans each year, such ""small"" differences represent thousands of Americans. There are also a number of interesting current studies that may impact in the longer term on the care of patients with cancer. Research of three different groups of investigators has recently converged. Over the past 3 decades several groups of basic laboratory investigators had been studying and cloning hematopoietic growth factors. Large randomized trials now confirm that myelosuppression after intensive chemotherapy can be substantially ameliorated, reducing infections and decreasing hospital days, risks, and costs. Another cohort of clinical pharmacologists and clinicians were studying bone marrow transplantation, developing combinations of agents that can be given at high dose to overcome resistance, albeit with considerable toxicity. Other groups in blood banks and those interested in the regulation of hematopoiesis recognized that early hematopoietic progenitor cells circulate in the peripheral blood.

The proportion of CD4 and CD45RA was decreased when compared with T cells from normal subjects. CD8 was markedly increased. The activity of concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells was not significantly different from that of normal controls and was negatively correlated to the percentage of CD4 of B-CLL patients. The selective loss of CD45RA cells was more prominent in patients in advanced Rai stages of the disease (III to IV) than in early stages (0 to II). Six patients of the advanced stages group suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas no patient in the early stages of disease showed an autoimmune phenomenon.

Expression of X and sialyl-X was weak on blasts in comparison with neutrophils despite the presence of the requisite precursor structures. Much higher levels of 3-fucosyltransferase activity were found in blasts than in neutrophils when nonsialylated substrates were used, but, whereas the enzyme in neutrophils reacted equally well with 3'-sialylated and nonsialylated acceptors, the enzyme in blasts showed a marked preference for nonsialylated substrates. 6'-Sialyltransferase activity was strong in blasts but was not detectable in neutrophils, whereas a much lower level of 3'-sialyltransferase activity was present in both blasts and neutrophils. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced maturation of HL60 cells was associated with (1) a decrease in both 6'-sialyltransferase and 3-fucosyltransferase activities, (2) a change in the substrate specificity of 3-fucosyltransferase towards that found in mature cells, and (3) increased cell surface expression of sialyl-X. These results suggest that the reduced expression of X in myeloblasts is related to the presence of the strong 6'-sialyltransferase, which uses the precursor substrate at the expense of the 3-fucosyltransferase and prevents the synthesis of X and sialyl-X. The developmental regulation of the levels of 3'- and 6'-sialyltransferases, and the level and specificity of the 3-fucosyltransferases, therefore controls the expression of X and its degree of sialylation.",['S0006-4971(20)84112-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The 74 kDa molecule, which was precipitated by the anti-P1.HTR anti-serum from the surface radiolabeled cell extract of P1.HTR tumor and was discriminated from the 70 kDa molecule precipitated by the anti-MuMTV serum, was widely distributed among various tumor cell lines tested, but was absent in normal tissue cells. In contrast to the extensive cross-reaction by the antibody, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte generated in the P1.HTR immune mice were shown to be specific to the P1.HTR tumor, and the 98 kDa molecule was precipitated by the anti-P1.HTR serum from the P1.HTR tumor but not from other tumors tested.

To delineate the genetic determinants underlying specific biologic characteristics, such as rate of replication, cytopathic effects, and ability to infect macrophages and T4 lymphoid cells, generation of hybrid HIV using viruses which exhibit distinct biologic features is essential. To develop methods for generating hybrid HIV, we constructed truncated HIV proviral DNA plasmids. Upon digestion with restriction enzymes, these plasmid DNAs were cotransfected into human rhabdomyosarcoma cells to generate hybrid HIV. The hybrid HIVs derived by this method were infectious upon transmission to both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and established human leukemic T-cell lines. The virus derived from molecular clone pHXB2 (HIVHTLV-III) productively infected CEMx174 cells. On the other hand, molecular clone pARV (HIVSF2)-derived virus did not show productive infection of CEMx174 cells when used as a cell-free virus. The hybrid HIV containing the 3' end of the genome from pARV and the 5' end of the genome from pHXB2 was effective in infecting CEMx174 cells, but the converse hybrid containing 5' pARV and 3' pHXB2 was not effective in infecting CEMx174 cells.

A number of studies have demonstrated that autologous infusion of such MNC achieved by cytapheresis may lead to a quick restoration of haemopoiesis. The initial results of peripheral blood MNC achievement in 18 patients with different malignancies of the blood are presented in this paper. Ninety-one cytapheresis sessions were carried out, 88 with a Fenwall CS-3000 continuous-flow machine, and the remaining three with a Haemonetics V-50 discontinuous-flow cell separator. The number of sessions per patient ranged from three to six and the harvested MNC count was 19.3 x 10(9)/L, the percentage of recovery being 56.4%. Some studies are currently in course aimed to analyse the MNC subpopulations in order to measure the progenitor-cell fraction and to establish the viability of such cells for further transplants. Since only five patients have recently been transplanted, all successfully, no definite conclusions can be drawn presently in this connection.",,,,,,,,,Recoleccion de celulas mononucleares de sangre periferica en hemopatias malignas.,,,

The relation between in-vitro sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs at initial diagnosis and long-term clinical outcome was investigated in 44 children with ALL. The short-term MTT assay was used to assess sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, colaspase (asparaginase), daunorubicin, and thioguanine (instead of mercaptopurine which is unstable in vitro). For vincristine and colaspase there was no difference in outcome (probability of continuous complete remission) between sensitive and resistant patients. However, the probability of continuous complete remission was significantly lower in patients with resistant cells than in those with sensitive cells for thioguanine (p less than 0.01), daunorubicin (p less than 0.02), and prednisolone (p less than 0.05). For prednisolone there was a significant worsening of the prognosis (p less than 0.05) from the extremely sensitive patients through an intermediate group to the most resistant group. The prognostic significance of cellular drug resistance was independent of white-blood-cell count, age, sex, and hepatosplenomegaly. Leukaemic cells from boys were more resistant to thioguanine than those from girls. Thus, the short-term highly efficient MTT assay can help to predict long-term response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL.","['0140-6736(91)91029-T [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(91)91029-t [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

This method is particularly useful in view of a chemical antineoplastic purging intended for autologous marrow transplantation. Forty marrows, which derived from patients suffering with leukemia and lymphoma, were fractionated with Ficoll on a COBE machine and in vitro purged with Mafosfamide at a dose of 50 micrograms/ml/1 x 10e7 MN cells. The density gradient separation enables to reduce the initial volume to 10%, the contaminating RBC to less than 1%, the total nucleated cells to 25% (greater than 80% of MNC) sparing about 80% of the CFU-GM. After purging, the surviving hemopoietic progenitor cells were 2.5%. The clinical effects of the fractionated purged cells were studied in 11 autotransplanted patients and compared with 14 transplants performed with untreated buffy-coat marrow derived cells. Ficoll cells produced less adverse effects at the time of reinfusion, while, as expected, the time of hematopoietic recovery was delayed in these patients (mafosfamide treated cells). These results confirm the usefulness of the gradient density cell separation to reduce the side effects of the DMSO and to make reliable the Mafosfamide purging manoeuvre, preventing the interference of contaminating RBC aldehyde dehydrogenase.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism of cross-resistance to tumor promoters in K562/ADM, we have established a K562 subline resistant to TPA-induced growth inhibition by exposing K562 cells to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine for 24 hr followed by continuous exposure to TPA. A K562 subline resistant to the TPA-induced growth inhibition, termed K562/TPA, was selected by a limiting dilution technique. K562/TPA was more than 500-fold resistant to TPA compared with parental K562 cells. K562/TPA showed cross-resistance to etoposide, teniposide, adriamycin (ADM), vincristine, vindesine and 3-[(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)] methyl-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, but showed collateral sensitivity to cisplatin. Although K562/ADM was not cross-resistant to 3'-deamino-3'-morpholino-13-deoxo-10-hydroxycarminomycin (MX2), an anthracycline derivative, K562/TPA was cross-resistant to MX2. By Northern blot analysis, K562/TPA did not express MDR-1. Accumulation of ADM by K562/TPA was no lower than that of K562 although that of K562/ADM was 5-fold lower than K562. We examined the subcellular distribution of ADM by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence of ADM was located in the nucleus of K562 and mainly in the cytoplasm of K562/TPA and K562/ADM. The distribution of ADM in K562/TPA, however, was different from that in K562/ADM. These results suggested that K562/TPA had a non-P-glycoprotein-mediated multi-drug-resistance phenotype and that the mechanism of drug-resistance in this cell line might be explained by an alteration in the intracellular drug distribution.",['10.1002/ijc.2910480622 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of myeloid antigens was found in 32 cases (20%), including 11 out of 49 adults (22.4%) and 21 out of 111 children (18.9%). CD33 was positive in 18 patients (11.3% of the total cases), CD13 in 15 patients (9.4%), CD 11b in 12 patients (7.5%) and CD14 in 1 patient (0.6%). Nine patients expressed two or more myeloid antigens. There were no significant differences in clinical manifestations and hematological pictures between the ALL patients with myeloid antigen expression (My+ ALL) and those without (My- ALL). No consistent chromosomal abnormality was found in My+ ALL. Eighty percent of the childhood and 44.4% of the adult My+ ALL patients achieved complete remission, compared with 87% and 80%, respectively, for childhood and adult My- ALL, but the differences were not statistically significant. After a median follow-up of 2.1 years, there were also no statistically significant associations between myeloid antigen expression and shorter duration of remission or poorer survival rate for patients with both adult and childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate differences in expression and regulation of the two IMPDH isozymes, we examined the steady-state levels of these mRNAs in various types of leukemic cells from patients. Northern blot analysis revealed that type II IMPDH was more active transcriptionally (1.5- to 5.1-fold) in all the leukemic cells examined than in normal lymphocytes, whereas type I expression was similar. The increased expression of type II mRNA in leukemic cells was closely linked with the increase in total IMPDH activity (r = 0.92). When leukemic cells from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis were separated into blast-rich and mature leukocyte-rich fractions, the expression of type II mRNA correlated positively with the population of immature leukemic cells, whereas type I expression was unchanged. Treatment of leukemic blasts with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate for 5 days resulted in a 90% decrease in the expression of type II mRNA with macrophage-like differentiation, while the expression of type I mRNA was relatively stable. These observations suggest that expression of type II IMPDH is stringently linked with immature characteristics of leukemic cells; thus, it should be a selective target for antileukemic chemotherapy.",,,,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In all patients in whom a liver biopsy was performed during the splenectomy, extramedullary hematopoiesis was demonstrated, consisting of dysmorphic megakaryocytes primarily localized in the sinusoids, often accompanied by erythroid precursors. Following splenectomy, a significant increase in both the liver size and serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was found within 6 months, whereas no such increase was observed in the serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase concentrations. In addition, 2 patients developed acute liver failure leading to death at 3 and 4 weeks from splenectomy, respectively.
