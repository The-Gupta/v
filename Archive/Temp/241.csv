In patients with recurrent leukemia after marrow transplantation, chimerism and tolerance provide ideal conditions for adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocytes. We studied the effect of donor lymphocyte transfusions on acute and chronic leukemia in relapse after bone marrow transplantation. One hundred thirty-five patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (N = 84), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (N = 23), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (N = 22), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (N = 5), and polycythemia vera with osteomyelofibrosis (PCV) (N = 1) were treated with transfusions of donor lymphocytes. Patients were monitored for response of leukemia, including in CML, the use of the polymerase chain reaction for bcr/abl mRNA transcripts and for the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and myelosuppression. Complete remissions were induced by donor lymphocyte transfusions in 54 patients with CML (73%) and in the patient with PCV; complete remissions were also induced in five patients (29%) with AML and a patient with MDS. In contrast, ALL did not respond to adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte transfusions. Remissions were durable in patients treated for CML in chronic phase (probability of remission: 87% at 3 years). Lymphocyte transfusions were also given to 18 patients with ALL, AML, MDS, and transformed phase CML who were in remission after chemotherapy. These remissions were not durable. Fifty-two patients (41%) developed GVHD of grade 2 or more, and 41 patients (34%) showed signs of myelosuppression. Seventeen patients died without leukemia, 14 patients with GVHD and/or myelosuppression.

Sixty-eight (19%) of the 358 patients had undergone splenectomy before transplantation. There was a trend towards more grade II-IV acute GVHD among splenectomized patients, but this was not significant in the multivariate analysis. The incidence of chronic GVHD was similar for splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients. Late infectious complications did not significantly differ between splenectomized and control patients (rates per patient year were 0.16 and 0.14, respectively). The overall risk of leukemic relapse was significantly increased for splenectomized patients (56% v 32% for controls, P = .001) and control patients with splenomegaly (P < .0001). Splenectomy and splenomegaly remained significant and independent hazards for relapse in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.82, P = .029; and HR, 1.49, P = .002; respectively). Relapse was also increased in patients with advanced disease (HR, 2.95; P = .0001), in patients with T-cell-depleted marrow (HR, 4.51; P = .0001), and in the female donor and male recipient combination (HR, 1.74; P = .044). Patients with splenectomy had an increased overall mortality (HR, 1.18), but this was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. In summary, our study showed no significant influence of splenectomy on late posttransplant infections, acute or chronic GVHD, or overall survival.

We analyzed the effect of LIF on human monocytes, which are a major source of chemotactic factors. We showed that supernatants of monocytes treated with LIF (50 ng/mL) for 18 hours had chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes that was neutralized by anti-interleukin-8 (anti-IL-8) and anti-monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (anti-MCAF) neutralizing antibodies. Northern blot analysis showed induction of IL-8 and MCAF RNA in monocytes treated with LIF. Both IL-8 and MCAF mRNA were induced within 3 hours of stimulation. IL-8 and MCAF mRNAs expression peaked at 6 hours and 18 hours, respectively. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a potent monocyte activator, inhibited IL-8 induction by LIF. On the contrary, IFN-gamma by itself induced MCAF and did not affect the LIF-induced MCAF. These results indicate that LIF released at the site of injury by inducing IL-8 and MCAF can play an important role in recruiting leukocytes and that IFN-gamma can differentially regulate this recruitment.","['Musso, T', 'Badolato, R', 'Longo, D L', 'Gusella, G L', 'Varesio, L']","['Musso T', 'Badolato R', 'Longo DL', 'Gusella GL', 'Varesio L']","['PRI/DynCorp, NCI-FCRDC, Biological Carcinogenesis and Development Program, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemotactic Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/physiology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76357-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 1;86(5):1961-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins play an important role in regulating cell-cycle progression and loss of their function has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) may induce cell growth arrest through p27 activation. TGF-beta often loses its ability to arrest growth of transformed cells; this could potentially occur through a defect in p27. To determine the role of p27 in tumorigenesis, we examined its mutational status in 74 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) (52 of B-cell phenotype, 22 of T-cell phenotype), 5 lymphoma cell lines, and 42 adult T-cell leukemias/lymphomas (ATLs) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and Southern blot analyses. A nonsense mutation (stop codon) that could result in expression of a truncated nonfunctional p27 protein was detected at codon 76 in one case of acute lymphomatous ATL, but not in matched normal tissues. Previously undescribed polymorphisms were also identified at codon 109 in the lymphomas and at codon 55 in the ATLs. Two homozygous deletions of the p27 gene were detected in one case of B-immunoblastic NHL and in one case of acute ATL by Southern blot hybridization. These results indicate that p27 gene alterations are rare events in NHLs and ATLs, but may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some hematologic malignancies.","['Morosetti, R', 'Kawamata, N', 'Gombart, A F', 'Miller, C W', 'Hatta, Y', 'Hirama, T', 'Said, J W', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Morosetti R', 'Kawamata N', 'Gombart AF', 'Miller CW', 'Hatta Y', 'Hirama T', 'Said JW', 'Tomonaga M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Codon', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76352-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 1;86(5):1924-30.,,,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using the polymerase chain reaction, the HTLV-I pX region was constantly detected in the genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an HTLV-I antibody-seronegative Egyptian MF patient enrolled in a study to isolate HTLV-I from North Africa. A CD4+ and interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-positive T-cell line was established when the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs of that patient were maintained in IL-2-containing culture medium. The cell line (EMF) was initially IL-2 dependent and then became IL-2 independent after gradual withdrawal of the IL-2. The cells reacted positively with monoclonal antibodies specific for the HTLV-I Env or HTLV-I Gag proteins. Using the Southern blot analysis, HTLV-I provirus could be detected in the genomic DNA extracted from the EMF cells. Limited nucleotide sequence of the env region showed more than 95% homology between the EMF provirus and other known HTLV-I isolates. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed the expression of the HTLV-I structural proteins.

Expression of all three alpha (VI) collagen chains in the human bone marrow (BM) microenvironment could be detected by chain-specific antibodies in tissue sections and in the adherent stromal layer of long-term BM cultures. In functional studies, collagen type VI was shown to be a strong adhesive substrate for various hematopoietic cell lines and light-density BM mononuclear cells. The adhesive site within the molecule seems to be restricted to the triple helical domain of all three alpha (VI) chains, because individual alpha (VI) chains were not active in the attachment assays. Adhesion of the hematopoietic cell lines to collagen VI was dose-dependent and could be inhibited by heparin. Although the triple helix contains several RGD sequences, adhesion of the hematopoietic cell types to collagen VI could be blocked neither by RGD-containing peptides nor by a neutralizing antibody to the beta 1 integrin subunit. In combination with an antiadhesive substrate, the binding properties of collagen VI could be downregulated. These data suggest that this collagen type may play an important role in the adhesion of hematopoietic cells within the BM microenvironment.","['Klein, G', 'Muller, C A', 'Tillet, E', 'Chu, M L', 'Timpl, R']","['Klein G', 'Muller CA', 'Tillet E', 'Chu ML', 'Timpl R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Clinic, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9007-34-5 (Collagen)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76330-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 1;86(5):1740-8.,,,['AR 38912/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Results with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) prompted comparison with patients from 1986 through 1991 and analysis of factors contributing to APL results. Patient and disease characteristics and treatment outcome were compared for all evaluable patients, with more detailed analysis of factors affecting APL treatment outcome. From 1982 through 1986, median survival and disease-free survival in 45 APL patients were 106 months and greater than 105 months, respectively, versus 6 and 14 months for 417 other AML patients. Such differences were not seen from 1986 through 1991. In the 141 APL patients from 1982 through 1991, after adjusting for significant patient and disease characteristics, higher daunomycin (DNR) doses during induction were significantly associated with higher complete remission rates (P < .0001), longer survival (P < .0001), and longer DFS (P < .0001). Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) induction dose, the inclusion of other chemotherapy agents in induction, postremission therapy (consolidation, maintenance, or bone marrow transplantation) other than DNR, APL subtype, and patient age did not appear to significantly affect outcome of APL, except for a significant detrimental effect of high-dose Ara-C in consolidation (P = .0042). Morphologic AML subtypes other than APL did not affect outcome. We conclude that high-dose DNR selectively increases survival in APL. This good survival is important for evaluation of combined all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/chemotherapy protocols and for planning future combinations of chemotherapy and ATRA. These results illustrate the need to individualize chemotherapy for subtypes of AML. Therapeutic response of APL is independent of age. Except for APL, morphologic subclassification of AML contributed little prognostic information.","['Head, D', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Weick, J', 'Files, J C', 'Ryan, D', 'Foucar, K', 'Montiel, M', 'Bickers, J', 'Fishleder, A', 'Miller, M']","['Head D', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Weick J', 'Files JC', 'Ryan D', 'Foucar K', 'Montiel M', 'Bickers J', 'Fishleder A', 'Miller M', 'et al.']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76327-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Sep 1;86(5):1717-28.,,,"['CA-04919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Among other mechanisms, the expression and pumping activity of P-glycoprotein (PGP) in the membrane of resistant cancer cells is responsible for the reduced uptake of cytostatics. The blockade or inhibition of PGP activity by chemosensitisers seems to be a tenable way to restore sensitivity to antineoplastic drugs and therapeutic efficacy. In the present work the influence of the new chemosensitiser dexniguldipine on rhodamine-123 accumulation in multidrug-resistant leukaemia cells was investigated. Dexniguldipine increases cellular rhodamine-123 accumulation dose-dependently.pEC50 values (-log concentration of drug showing a half maximal effect) in accumulation studies are dependent on pH of the test system and are in the range of 6.5 (pH 7.2) to 7.2 (pH 8.0) for dexniguldipine.

A clear dose-dependency was seen and, moreover, a dramatic decrease in efflux rates was achieved in the presence of chemosensitisers.

In cell culture, unlike in vivo, apoptotic cells are not phagocytosed and eventually lyse (secondary necrosis). This is of practical importance because metabolic changes seen in cultures may be due to the transition from apoptosis to necrosis, rather than to the induction of apoptosis itself. In the present study, we followed the kinetics of the occurrence of several indicators of cell death in rat thymocytes and mouse lymphoma (S.49), and human leukemia (CEM) cell cultures after dexamethasone treatment (10(-6) M). The presence of apoptosis and secondary necrosis was demonstrated by electron microscopy. Nuclear condensation and fragmentation, which are considered to reflect early stages of apoptosis, were visualized with Hoechst fluorescent dye H 33258 for quantitative determination by light microscopy. In S.49 and CEM cultures their incidence increased after glucocorticoid treatment, but remained at relatively low levels not exceeding 6-9% until 36 h (S.49) or 3-4% until 92 h (CEM).

Furthermore, flow cytometry (single parameter DNA analysis after propidium iodide staining) revealed the occurrence of cells with reduced DNA fluorescence.

PI-TP alpha lacks this activity completely. By indirect immunofluorescence we demonstrated that, in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, PI-TP beta is preferentially associated with the Golgi system whereas PI-TP alpha is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

We have recently described sphingosine, a sphingolipid-breakdown product, as a potent and specific inducer of Rb dephosphorylation resulting in inhibition of cell growth and a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here we examine the role of Rb and its interaction with E2F in mediating the effects of sphingosine on cell growth. Sphingosine potently inhibited growth of lymphoblastic leukaemic cells, Molt-4, at submicromolar concentrations but showed a 10-fold reduced potency in inhibiting growth of retinoblastoma cells, WERI-Rb-1, which lack functional Rb. In addition, sphingosine's ability to inhibit growth of mink lung epithelial cells was significantly attenuated in cells overexpressing simian virus 40 large T antigen which binds Rb and related proteins. Sphingosine treatment of Molt-4 cells, but not WERI-Rb-1 cells, resulted in the loss of the specific E2F bands produced by the interaction of E2F and its specific DNA sequence element on gel-shift assays. The concentration (submicromolar) and kinetics (4 h) of sphingosine treatment were identical with those required to induce Rb dephosphorylation. In addition, at similar concentrations, sphingosine caused c-myc down-regulation in Molt-4 cells starting at 6 h after treatment. These results demonstrate that activation of Rb by sphingosine leads to sequestration of E2F by the active (hypophosphorylated) form of Rb with the resultant loss of its DNA-binding and genetranscribing abilities. A functional Rb is required to mediate the specific effects of sphingosine on growth arrest.","['Dbaibo, G S', 'Wolff, R A', 'Obeid, L M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Dbaibo GS', 'Wolff RA', 'Obeid LM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'FFV58UNY7O (stearylamine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Amines/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Eye Neoplasms', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mink', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3100453 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Sep 1;310 ( Pt 2):453-9. doi: 10.1042/bj3100453.,,,['GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['c-myc'],,,PMC1135917,,,,,,,

Impaired neutrophil function has often been reported in myeloproliferative diseases and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), but its laboratory features have not been well characterized. Traditionally, NADPH oxidase activity has been evaluated with a microscopic method by nitroblue tetrazolium salt reduction to blue-black insoluble formazan granules identified in positive neutrophils by microscopy. We investigated neutrophil NADPH oxidase in 22 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (cMPDs) and 15 patients with MDSs, using the microscopic method as well as a photometric microplate assay, which monitored the cytochemical reaction for 30 min. The relationship between cMPD and patient susceptibility to infections was also investigated. In the photometric assay, the mean enzyme activity in MDSs and cMPDs was lower than in normal subjects. NADPH oxidase activity was greater in cMPDs (except myelofibrosis) than in MDSs (except chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), and these differences were less evident with microscopy. Moreover, for cMPDs, patients with susceptibility to infections showed a lower NADPH oxidase activity than patients without infections.","['Piva, E', 'De Toni, S', 'Caenazzo, A', 'Pradella, M', 'Pietrogrande, F', 'Plebani, M']","['Piva E', 'De Toni S', 'Caenazzo A', 'Pradella M', 'Pietrogrande F', 'Plebani M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hospital-University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*blood', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Photometry']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000203965 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1995;94(1):16-22. doi: 10.1159/000203965.,,['Acta Haematol. 1996;96(4):264-5.

A series of amino terminal deletion mutants (d10, d20, d27, d31, d40, d44, and d73) were compared for processing, cell surface expression, and maintenance of their biological attributes by recombinant expression of mutant genes using a plasmid vector (pcDL-SR alpha-296) in CV-1 and HeLa cells. To determine the fusion promoting activity (FPA) of the various mutant proteins, a simple assay was developed which quantified the fusion of two different HeLa cell types. One of the cell types, HeLa-tat, constitutively expressed the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) tat protein from a Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR), while the second cell type, HeLa beta-gal, contained a reporter gene, beta-galactosidase, under the control of an HIV1-LTR. Fusion of mixed HeLa cell monolayers (50:50, HeLa-tat: HeLa beta-gal), following transfection with appropriate plasmids, resulted in transactivation of the reporter gene which was then measured by direct staining of cells or using cell lysates with appropriate substrates. Cell fusion was observed only when both the HPIV3 F and functional HN proteins were both co-transfected into cells. Of the seven deletion mutants examined, only d10, d20, d27 and d31 were expressed to significant levels on the cell surface and only these four mutant proteins maintained FPA. Compared with the wt HN at 48 h post transfection, d10 and d20 had enhanced FPA (119% and 158%, respectively), while d27 and d31 were diminished (74% and > 4%, respectively). Analysis of protein expression suggested that the reason for the increase in FPA of the mutant proteins was that the levels of protein expressed at the cell surface was twofold or threefold higher for d10 and d20, respectively, compared to the wt HN.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Galinski, M S']","['Tanaka Y', 'Galinski MS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (HN Protein)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Tail Proteins)', '109300-94-9 (F protein, parainfluenza virus 3)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tat/metabolism', 'HN Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hemadsorption', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Tail Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(94)00111-O [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(94)00111-o [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1995 May;36(2-3):131-49. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(94)00111-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Splenic CD8+ T cells were enriched by depletion of CD4+ T cells by ""planning"" or purified by positive selection by cell sorting. Although C57BL/Ka bone marrow cells reconstitute lethally irradiated BALB/c mice without severe GVHD, the addition of at least 1.0 x 10(6) donor spleen cells induced uniform acute lethal GVHD. Equivalent doses of spleen cells depleted of CD4+ T cells failed to induce lethal GVHD. Allogeneic bone marrow cells alone failed to mediate antitumor activity against the BCL1 B cell leukemia/lymphoma as compared with syngeneic bone marrow and spleen cell injections. Despite the inability to induce severe GVHD, CD4+ T cell-depleted allogeneic spleen cells prevented the progressive growth of the BCL1 tumor, and eliminated BCL1 idiotype-positive tumor cells in the blood. In order to determine whether CD8+ T cells can prevent tumor growth in the absence of other spleen cell subsets, such as NK cells, that are present in the CD4- populations, highly purified CD8+ T cells were obtained by positive selection using flow cytometry. The latter cells prevented the progressive growth of the tumor, and markedly reduced the level of tumor cells in the blood. Sorted CD8+ T cells facilitated the engraftment of allogeneic marrow cells in sublethally irradiated hosts. Thus, addition of highly purified CD8+ T cells to marrow cells provides GVL activity and facilitates engraftment without inducing severe GVHD in most recipients.","['Palathumpat, V', 'Dejbakhsh-Jones, S', 'Strober, S']","['Palathumpat V', 'Dejbakhsh-Jones S', 'Strober S']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Chimera', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",1995/08/27 00:00,1995/08/27 00:01,['1995/08/27 00:00'],"['1995/08/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/27 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199508270-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1995 Aug 27;60(4):355-61. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199508270-00010.,,,['R01-CA55793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Among the clinical uses of flow cytometry cancer represents one of the most relevant. Several applications of flow cytometry can currently be applied to the study of cancer, including the detection of tumour cell DNA aneuploidy, the analysis of tumour cell proliferation and the immunophenotyping of leukemias. Although standardized flow cytometry protocols for these applications are scanty, the clinical value has been clearly established. The presence of DNA aneuploidy and a high proportion of S-phase tumour cells have been associated with tumour malignancy and a poor prognosis. The immunophenotype of leukaemia is of great help both for the diagnosis and classification of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and acute leukaemias, especially in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and the M0, M3-variant, M6 and M7 acute myeloblastic leukaemia subtypes. In addition, it allows the identification of relatively rare leukemia cases such as the biphenotypic and the Nk-cell lineage leukemias. The development of flow cytometry is continuously bringing new applications into the clinical laboratory in the area of cancer diagnosis.","['Orfao, A', 'Ciudad, J', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Lopez, A', 'del Mar Abad, M', 'Paz Bouza, J I', 'Cruz, J J', 'Gomez Alonso, A', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Orfao A', 'Ciudad J', 'Gonzalez M', 'Lopez A', 'del Mar Abad M', 'Paz Bouza JI', 'Cruz JJ', 'Gomez Alonso A', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio General de Citometria, University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Norway,Scand J Clin Lab Invest Suppl,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation.

The AML1 gene is highly homologous to the Drosophila segmentation gene runt and the mouse transcription factor PEBP2 alpha subunit gene. This region of homology, called the Runt domain, is responsible for DNA-binding and protein--protein interaction. In this study, we isolated and characterized various forms of AML1 cDNAs which reflect a complex pattern of mRNA species. Analysis of these cDNAs has led to the identification of two distinct AML1 proteins, designated AML1b (453 amino acids) and AML1c (480 amino acids), which differ markedly from the previously reported AML1a (250 amino acids) with regard to their C-terminal regions, although all three contain the Runt domain. The large C-terminal region common to AML1b and AML1c is suggested to be a transcriptional activation domain. AML1c differs from AML1b by only 32 amino acids in the N-terminal. Characterization of the genomic structure revealed that the AML1 gene consists of nine exons and spans > 150 kb of genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of six major transcripts, encoding AML1b or AML1c, which can all be explained by the existence of two promoters, alternative splicing and differential usage of three polyadenylation sites. A minor transcript encoding AML1a which results from alternative splicing of a separate exon can be detected only by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification. The distinct proteins encoded by the AML1 gene may have different functions, which could contribute to regulating cell growth and/or differentiation through transcriptional regulation of a specific subset of target genes.","['Miyoshi, H', 'Ohira, M', 'Shimizu, K', 'Mitani, K', 'Hirai, H', 'Imai, T', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Soeda, E', 'Ohki, M']","['Miyoshi H', 'Ohira M', 'Shimizu K', 'Mitani K', 'Hirai H', 'Imai T', 'Yokoyama K', 'Soeda E', 'Ohki M']","['Radiobiology Division National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/07/25 00:00,1995/07/25 00:01,['1995/07/25 00:00'],"['1995/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['5c0041 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/23.14.2762 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1995 Jul 25;23(14):2762-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/23.14.2762.,,,,['AML1'],"['GENBANK/D43967', 'GENBANK/D43968', 'GENBANK/D43969']",,PMC307102,,,,,,,

Following irradiation of exponentially growing cells in suspension at doses of 2 and 20 J/cm2 a number of sensitive bioassays were used to facilitate the detection of laser-induced mutations, DNA damage and cell killing. Mutations were assessed by the examination of chromosome spreads, the determination of micronucleus frequency and by the determination of the mutant frequency at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hgprt) locus. DNA damage was quantified using a sensitive ELISA. The cytotoxic effect of laser irradiation was assessed using a cloning assay. The results of this investigation did not show any significant increase in mutation frequency, DNA damage or cell survival in the laser-irradiated cells, compared to sham-irradiated controls.

We have previously shown that this CBF beta-SMMHC chimeric protein can transform NIH 3T3 cells and that this process requires regions of the chimeric protein necessary for association with the CBF alpha subunit. In this study, we show that NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing murine Cbf alpha 2 (also known as Aml1) cannot be transformed by CBF beta-SMMHC and that overexpression of Cbf alpha 2 in cells previously transformed by CBF beta-SMMHC reverts the cells to a less transformed phenotype. Cbf alpha 2 overexpression does not cause any gross morphological changes to NIH 3T3 cells but does result in increased CBF activity, as indicated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation of reporter constructs. Cells transformed by CBF beta-SMMHC lack normal CBF-DNA complexes and have decreased levels of transactivation. Reversion of CBF beta-SMMHC transformation by Cbf alpha 2 is associated with a restoration of normal CBF-DNA complexes and transactivation activity. A Cbf alpha 2 mutant lacking transactivation properties does not transform cells when overexpressed, nor does it protect cells from CBF beta-SMMHC transformation. These results suggest that CBF beta-SMMHC interferes with the normal function of CBF and that this interference is necessary but not sufficient for cellular transformation.","['Hajra, A', 'Liu, P P', 'Speck, N A', 'Collins, F S']","['Hajra A', 'Liu PP', 'Speck NA', 'Collins FS']","['Laboratory of Gene Transfer, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.9.4980 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Sep;15(9):4980-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.9.4980.,,,['CA58343-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC230745,,"['Hajra A, Liu PP, Speck NA, Collins FS.

Using a mouse mast cell line (IC.DP), we previously showed that v-Abl PTK induced resistance to the anti-cancer drugs melphalan and hydroxyurea by the suppression of apoptosis. Here, using this cell line, we demonstrate by alkaline elution that v-Abl PTK did not affect the levels of DNA damage induced by either drug. This confirms that v-Abl PTK acts downstream of the drug-target interaction to prevent the coupling of drug-induced damage to the apoptotic pathway. Although Abl PTK- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-stimulated signaling events share common signaling pathways, a similar level of drug resistance was not provided by IL-3, implying that Abl PTK does not merely mimic an IL-3 survival signaling pathway. Previously we demonstrated translocation of protein kinase C-beta II stimulated by activation of Abl PTK. Drug sensitivity was restored in cells with active v-Abl PTK by simultaneous addition of calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in the suppression of drug-induced apoptosis by v-Abl PTK. One novel strategy for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia could therefore include the use of a downstream modifier of the Abl PTK-mediated survival signaling pathway to render leukemic cells more sensitive to a second drug, such as a cytotoxic agent.","['Chapman, R S', 'Whetton, A D', 'Chresta, C M', 'Dive, C']","['Chapman RS', 'Whetton AD', 'Chresta CM', 'Dive C']","['Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Drug Resistance', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1995 Aug;48(2):334-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of a series of DDATHF derivatives differing in structure throughout the molecule has allowed a study of the structural requirements for substrate activity with mouse liver and hog liver FPGS. Kinetics of the polyglutamation reaction in vitro have been related to the potency of these compounds as inhibitors of the growth of human CEM leukemic cells. The structure-activity relationships for enzyme from both sources were nearly identical. FPGS from both species showed a broad acceptance for structural changes in the pyridopyrimidine ring, in the phenyl group, and in the intermediate bridge region, with structural changes in these regions being reflected in changes in Km for FPGS but much more modest alterations in Vmax. The data suggested that the phenyl ring was not contributing to any pi-pi hydrophobic interactions. It appeared to function primarily in maintaining a favorable distance between the pyridopyrimidine ring and the glutamate side chain. The lowest Km values were found for DDATHF analogs in which there were small alterations at the 10 position, e.g., 5-deazatetrahydrofolate, 10-methyl-DDATHF, and 10-formyl-5-deazatetrahydrofolate; the first-order rate constants for these substrates were the highest in this series, an indication of the efficiency of polyglutamation at low substrate concentrations.

If we assume that during the time spent in a sterile unit and isolation, because of the regressive position, patients use early defending mechanisms, which again, reflect in the reactions of the team members. The aim of this project is to analyse transference and counter-transference problems of the patients and the team members during the BMT. The method used was psychodynamic clinical observance and analysis of transference and counter-transference problems of patients and the team members during the process of transplantation. Thirty-five patients with acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treated with allogenic BMT, were observed during their stay in a sterile unit over the 5-year period. Transplantation procedure, based on observation of psychological dwelling and transference reactions of the patients, is divided into five phases while, from the perspective of the team members, the counter-transference problems are revealed especially during the moments of helplessness. The most important mechanism that the team members are using to protect themselves from this feeling is ""selective avoidance of psychological"", in other words, avoidance of empathy.","['Gregurek, R', 'Ladika, I']","['Gregurek R', 'Ladika I']","['Klinika za psiholossku medicinu, Medicinski fakultet Sveucilisa u Zagrebu, Klinicki bolnicki centar.']",['hrv'],['Journal Article'],Croatia,Lijec Vjesn,Lijecnicki vjesnik,0074253,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', '*Countertransference', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Transference, Psychology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lijec Vjesn. 1995 Jan-Feb;117(1-2):2-8.,,,,,,,,Transferni i kontratransferni problemi u radu s bolesnicima lijecenim transplantacijom kostane srzi.,,,,,,

When measuring the pKa of the 2' alpha-proton of CNDAC, we found that CNDAC epimerized to 2'-C-cyano-2'-deoxy-1-beta-D-ribo-pentofuranosylcytosine (CNDC) with concomitant degradation of both CNDAC and CNDC to cytosine and 1,4-anhydro-2-C-cyano-2-deoxy-D-erythro-pent-1- enitol. Kinetic analysis of these reactions showed that abstraction of the acidic 2'-proton of CNDAC and CNDC initiated the reactions, which quickly reached an equilibrium. In the equilibrium, a concentration ratio of CNDAC and CNDC was about 3:5. Concomitant degradation of these nucleosides was found to be rather slow. Deuterium incorporation experiments with CNDAC in a D2O buffer suggested the mechanism of the beta-elimination reactions is an E1cB type. These epimerization and degradation reactions were found even in neutral conditions (pH 7.5) and also occurred in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium. The discovery of which nucleoside possesses the predominate tumor cell growth inhibitory activity was important. While both nucleosides showed potent tumor cell growth inhibitory activity against three human tumor cell lines (colon carcinoma WiDr, small cell lung carcinoma SBC-5, and stomach carcinoma MKN-74 cells) in 48 h of incubation, in 20 min of incubation, CNDAC was 11-50 times more effective than CNDC.

We report here that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATp), a cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive factor that regulates the transcription of several cytokines, mediates CD16-induced activation of cytokine genes in human NK cells. CD16 (Fc gamma RIIIA)-induced expression of cytokine mRNA in NK cells occurs via a CsA-sensitive and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Stimulation of NK cells with CD16 ligands induces NFAT-like DNA binding activity in the nuclear extracts from these cells, as detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This occurs with fast kinetics after stimulation, via a CsA-sensitive and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis. NK cell NFAT is present in the cytosol of nonstimulated cells, migrates to the nucleus upon stimulation, and can associate with AP-1. Two distinct molecules, NFATp and NFATc, have been reported to mediate NFAT activity. The results of supershift assays using NFATp- and NFATc- specific antibodies indicate that NK cell activation early after CD16 ligand binding involves primarily, if not exclusively, NFATp, and Western blot analysis shows that this has the same electrophoretic mobility (approximately 120 kD) as that of T lymphocytes. NK cells do not express NFATc constitutively, but NFATc mRNA accumulation is induced in these cells within 2 h of stimulation with CD16 ligands. However, supershift assays using the available mAb recognizing the T cell NFATc revealed no detectable NFATc protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from CD16- or phorbol ester-stimulated cells at any time tested, up to 4 h. These results provide the first direct evidence that both CsA-sensitive transcription factors, NFATp and NFATc, are expressed in human NK cells, and that their activation and/or expression can be regulated in primary cells by a single stimulus, that, in the case of CD16 in NK cells, results in early activation of NFATp and subsequently induced expression of NFATc mRNA.","['Aramburu, J', 'Azzoni, L', 'Rao, A', 'Perussia, B']","['Aramburu J', 'Azzoni L', 'Rao A', 'Perussia B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Receptors, IgG/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.182.3.801 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Sep 1;182(3):801-10. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.3.801.,,,"['CA37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2192167,,,,,,,

To investigate its potential role in the regulation of uterine function in the human, LIF secretion by isolated human endometrial glandular epithelial and stromal cells in primary culture was determined. Endometrial cells secreted a detectable amount of LIF protein during the first 48 h of culture. In the follicular and late-luteal phases, LIF secretion by both cell types was low. At every stage of the menstrual cycle, the epithelial cells secreted significantly more LIF than did stromal cells. Glandular epithelial cells of the mid-luteal phase, at the expected time of implantation in the human, secreted significantly more LIF than at other stages of the cycle. Stromal cells showed a similar, but nonsignificant, LIF secretion pattern. It could be concluded that endometrial LIF expression was dependent on cell type and stage of the menstrual cycle, and might thus play a role in human implantation. Oestradiol-17 beta stimulated both prostaglandin (PG) F and E release by the epithelial cells in both follicular and luteal phases. PGE release during the luteal phase was greater than in the follicular phase. However, addition of recombinant human LIF did not change either PGF or PGE release in either follicular or luteal phases, in the presence or absence of oestradiol.","['Chen, D B', 'Hilsenrath, R', 'Yang, Z M', 'Le, S P', 'Kim, S R', 'Chuong, C J', 'Poindexter, A N 3rd', 'Harper, M J']","['Chen DB', 'Hilsenrath R', 'Yang ZM', 'Le SP', 'Kim SR', 'Chuong CJ', 'Poindexter AN 3rd', 'Harper MJ']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Menstruation/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/*biosynthesis', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a136060 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1995 Apr;10(4):911-8. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a136060.,,,['HD14048/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These variant polypeptides differ in sequence only at the N terminus of their cytoplasmic domains. Molecular analyses have shown that transcripts derived from both of the erythroid-specific promoters, P1 and P2, encode all four of these AE1 anion exchanger variants. However, quantitative RNase protection analyses have shown that the transcripts derived from the P1 promoter are much more prevalent than those derived from the P2 promoter. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies have indicated that the extensive diversity in the transcripts derived from the AE1 gene occurs both in primitive and definitive lineage erythroid cells. Transient transfection analyses using human erythroleukemia cells have investigated the functional significance of the alternative sequences at the N terminus of these variant exchangers. These studies have shown that the erythroid AE1 variants are sorted to different membrane compartments in these cells. The approximately 99- and approximately 102-kDa variants are primarily sorted to the plasma membrane, whereas the approximately 108-kDa variant is retained in a perinuclear compartment. These results suggest that the alternative N-terminal cytoplasmic sequences of these polypeptides may serve as signals to direct these variant transporters to different membrane compartments within cells.","['Cox, K H', 'Adair-Kirk, T L', 'Cox, J V']","['Cox KH', 'Adair-Kirk TL', 'Cox JV']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'DNA/genetics', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/25 00:00,1995/08/25 00:01,['1995/08/25 00:00'],"['1995/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.34.19752 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94546-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Aug 25;270(34):19752-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.34.19752.,,,,,['GENBANK/S79409'],,,,,,,,,

This study demonstrates enhancement of expression from Mtv and Emv loci in P388D1 cells by more physiological hydrocortisone concentrations (1 microM), and shows direct transcriptional mode of regulation by blocking GC-mediated signal transduction at different levels. Furthermore, we found up-regulation of Emv mRNA steady-state levels in murine lymphoid lineage cells (T-like EL4 and BW5147 cells; B-like X63 cells) upon GC treatment. The Emv transcripts shown by us to be GC-up-regulated encode for the transmembrane envelope protein TM/p15E which is highly conserved in several retroviruses.

The following cells were investigated: human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human monocyte (THP-1), and human Burkitt lymphoma (DAUDI). All of these cells produced a significant endothelium-dependent relaxation of the dog coronary artery in the presence of ibuprofen. The endothelium-dependent relaxations were reversed by hemoglobin (10 microM), methylene blue (3 microM), 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione (LY 83583, 30 microM), and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mM). HL-60 cells grown in the presence of 1 mM L-NAME retained their ability to cause endothelium-dependent relaxation of the canine coronary artery, suggesting that the source of the NO was the endothelium and not the HL-60 cells. The cell-induced vascular relaxation could be obtained in the absence of extracellular calcium. It is suggested that HL-60, THP-1, and DAUDI cells interact with a specific receptor on the endothelial cell and as a result of this interaction the endothelial cells are stimulated to release EDRF.","['Kleha, J F', 'Devesly, P', 'Johns, A']","['Kleha JF', 'Devesly P', 'Johns A']","['Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA 94804-0099, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (SRS-A)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '91300-60-6 (6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Coronary Vessels/cytology/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Methylene Blue/pharmacology', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'SRS-A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/y95-052 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 1995 Mar;73(3):404-8. doi: 10.1139/y95-052.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, loss of growth inhibition in advanced melanomas has been associated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. Because IL-6 belongs to the hematopoietic cytokine family, which includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-11 (IL-11), we examined the possibility of coordinate expression of LIF, IL-6, and IL-11 in three human melanoma cell lines derived from primary lesions (early) and in four lines derived from metastatic tumors (advanced). All lines examined produced at least low levels of LIF and IL-11 mRNA as measured by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), two of three early and three of four advanced lines were found to secrete LIF protein. IL-11 was assayed using growth of the responsive B9/11 cell line, but only one of seven lines made a low but measurable amount of IL-11. Cytokine protein production was not strictly correlated with mRNA abundance, nor was it strongly correlated with tumor staging. Recombinant LIF and IL-11 protein had no effect on the proliferation of any of the seven lines, suggesting that they do not act as autocrine growth factors for these melanomas. Assay of IL-6, IL-11, and LIF protein in conditioned medium from early and advanced melanoma lines gave no evidence of coordinate expression of these cytokines. We conclude that LIF and IL-11 production by melanomas may have some paracrine or endocrine function in the course of melanoma progression.","['Paglia, D', 'Oran, A', 'Lu, C', 'Kerbel, R S', 'Sauder, D N', 'McKenzie, R C']","['Paglia D', 'Oran A', 'Lu C', 'Kerbel RS', 'Sauder DN', 'McKenzie RC']","['Division of Dermatology, Sunnybrook HSC, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.- (Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Melanoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1995.15.455 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995 May;15(5):455-60. doi: 10.1089/jir.1995.15.455.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different recovery of nucleolar proteins B23 and C23 and nuclear lamins.,15-22,"Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue we have studied the protein composition of the nuclear matrix obtained from mouse erythroleukemic nuclei kept at 0 degrees C throughout the isolation procedure to prepare the high ionic strength resistant fraction (control matrix) or stabilized in vitro or in vivo by different procedures prior to subfractionation (ie 37 degrees C incubation of isolated nuclei; sodium tetrathionate exposure of purified nuclei; heat shock of intact cells). When the matrix obtained from 37 degrees C incubated nuclei was compared with the control matrix, striking differences in the polypeptide pattern were seen if the protein was obtained in both cases from an equivalent number of nuclei. On the other hand, if the same amount of protein for both the samples was applied to the gels the differences were less evident. Sodium tetrathionate stabilization of isolated nuclei and heat shock of intact cells produced a matrix protein pattern that was very similar and differed from that of the in vitro heat-exposed matrix. Using specific polyclonal antisera, we demonstrate that nucleolar proteins B23/numatrin and C23/nucleolin were very abundant in the matrix obtained from chemically-treated nuclei or in vivo heat-stabilized nuclei but were recovered in very small amounts (B23) or completely absent (C23) in the matrix prepared from nuclei heated to 37 degrees C in vitro. Differences were seen also in the recovery of nuclear lamins, and especially lamin B, that was poorly represented in the sodium tetrathionate-stabilized matrix. The results demonstrate that in mouse erythroleukemia cells the increased recovery of nuclear matrix protein that is seen after in vitro heating of isolated nuclei is predominantly due to an additional recovery of the same types of polypeptides that are detected also in the absence of such a treatment. The data also indicate that in vivo heat shock of intact cells produces a nuclear matrix protein pattern that is more similar to the pattern seen after stabilization of purified nuclei with sodium tetrathionate and differs significantly from that obtained by exposing nuclei to 37 degrees C in vitro, unlike to that what previous reports have indicated.","['Martelli, A M', 'Manzoli, L', 'Rubbini, S', 'Billi, A M', 'Bareggi, R', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Manzoli L', 'Rubbini S', 'Billi AM', 'Bareggi R', 'Cocco L']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (phosphoprotein C23)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '8V1L8R19JH (Tetrathionic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chickens', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Matrix/*chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Rabbits', 'Tetrathionic Acid/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0248490096899278 [pii]', '10.1016/0248-4900(96)89927-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 1995;83(1):15-22. doi: 10.1016/0248-4900(96)89927-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human homologue (CBFA2) was originally identified because of its involvement in the t(8;21) associated with a subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia. The phylogenetically conserved region (runt box) was reported to correspond to a DNA binding domain. In order to investigate whether runt also plays a role in mammalian development, we have conducted a preliminary survey of its expression in the mouse embryo. Expression in embryonic tissues was detected starting from day 9.2 post coitum. From day 10.5 post coitum, highest levels are found in the neural tube, sensory ganglia, specialised sensory epithelial structures (olfactory and gustatory mucosa, follicles of the vibrissae), all chondrogenic centres (both of neural crest and of mesodermal origin), and the genital system (the gonad, the paramesonephros, and the genital tubercle). Unambiguous expression in the haemopoietic system could be established for the thymus. The data suggest a pleiotropic role for mammalian runt in embryogenesis.","['Simeone, A', 'Daga, A', 'Calabi, F']","['Simeone A', 'Daga A', 'Calabi F']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (run protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Probes', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Pregnancy', 'Transcription Factors']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/aja.1002030107 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 1995 May;203(1):61-70. doi: 10.1002/aja.1002030107.,,,,['CBFA2'],,,,,,,,,,

This study, on a clean and reproducible charged surface, unraveled the purely physical interactions among these compounds and the surface, apart from the complexity of the biological membrane. The interfacial behavior of two classical inducers, hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) and dimethylsulfoxide, was compared with that of a typical apolar aliphatic compound, 1-octanol, that has a similar hydrophobic moiety as HMBA but a much smaller dipolar moment. Both HMBA and Octanol adsorb flat in contact with the surface because of hydrophobic forces, with a very similar free energy of adsorption. However, the ratio of polar to apolar moieties in PAIs turned out to be crucial to drive the adsorption maximum toward physiological values of surface charge density, where octanol is desorbed. The electrostatic effects in the interfacial region reflected the adsorption properties: the changes in the potential drop across the interfacial region as a function of the surface charge density, in the physiological range, were opposite in PAIs as compared with apolar aliphatic compounds, as exemplified by octanol. This peculiar electrostatic effect of PAIs has far-reaching relevance for the design of inducers with an adequate therapeutic index to be used in clinical trials.","['Carla, M', 'Cuomo, M', 'Arcangeli, A', 'Olivotto, M']","['Carla M', 'Cuomo M', 'Arcangeli A', 'Olivotto M']","['Dipartimento di Fisica della Universita di Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Adsorption', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrodes', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mercury', 'Models, Biological']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(95)80446-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80446-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1995 Jun;68(6):2615-21. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80446-7.,,,,,,,PMC1282172,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the combined effect of these chemical inducers on the differentiation of HL-60 and AML-193 promyelocytic leukemia cell lines. Simultaneous RA+D3 addition potentiated leukemic cell maturation up to mature phagocytic cells. Interestingly, AML-193 cells induced with D3 and RA displayed a typical neutrophilic morphology while exhibiting properties specific to monocytic cells, e.g., high expression of CD14 membrane antigen, capacity to bind bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and monocytic-specific esterase activity; this hybrid granulomonocytic (GM) phenotype was not observed upon initial incubation with one inducer and later addition of the other. Parallel control studies were performed with purified normal GM progenitors, triggered by interleukin 3+GM-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in FCS-rich or -free clonogenic culture, by GM-CSF+M-CSF in FCS-rich clonogenic culture, and by M-CSF in liquid suspension culture. The progenitors grown in the first condition generate exclusively G clones, even upon addition of D3 and/or RA. The progenitors grown in the second and third culture conditions generate either G and M clones (second culture condition) or a population of cells composed by a majority of monocytes (third culture condition); the D3 addition did not modify this differentiation pattern, whereas RA or RA+D3 addition elicited a marked inhibition of monocytic differentiation. These observations suggest that the development of a hybrid GM phenotype is restricted to the progeny of bipotent GM leukemic precursors.","['Masciulli, R', 'Testa, U', 'Barberi, T', 'Samoggia, P', 'Tritarelli, E', 'Pustorino, R', 'Mastroberardino, G', 'Camagna, A', 'Peschle, C']","['Masciulli R', 'Testa U', 'Barberi T', 'Samoggia P', 'Tritarelli E', 'Pustorino R', 'Mastroberardino G', 'Camagna A', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Phagocytes/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 May;6(5):493-503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that M7 blasts and TMD blasts correspond to the erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells.","['Ito, E', 'Kasai, M', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Toki, T', 'Arai, K', 'Yokoyama, S', 'Kato, K', 'Tachibana, N', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yokoyama, M']","['Ito E', 'Kasai M', 'Hayashi Y', 'Toki T', 'Arai K', 'Yokoyama S', 'Kato K', 'Tachibana N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yokoyama M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05591.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Jul;90(3):607-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05591.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When PGM-1 cells were cultured on pre-established adherent layers from primary human marrow samples, their fate depended on the source of the human marrow. Adherent layers from healthy marrow donors or patients with reactive marrow alterations had no or very little capacity to maintain PGM-1 cells in an immature colony-forming state. However, in coculture with adherent layers from patients with myeloid leukaemia or, to a lesser extent, lymphoblastic leukaemia or marrow-infiltrating lymphoma the colony-forming potential was retained. There was no correlation between the remission status of the patient and the PGM-1 activity of the adherent layer. Consistent morphological differences between active and inactive stromal layers were not observed. The PGM-1 coculture system enables the detection of a hitherto undescribed regulatory abnormality in bone marrow malignancies.

We have studied the synthetic analogue, norcantharidin (NCTD), which has less nephrotoxic and phlogogenic side-effects, investigating the effects on the normal haemopoietic system and leukaemia cell growth. Daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of NCTD induced dose and circadian time-dependent transient leucocytosis in normal mice, but did not accelerate bone marrow (BM) regeneration, or have haemopoietic offe-effects following chronic administration. NCTD stimulated the cell cycle progression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC), stimulated DNA synthesis and increased the frequency of mitotic cells in short-term human BM cultures. NCTD also stimulated the production of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, colony stimulating activity (CSA) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Continuous in vitro NCTD treatment, however, inhibited both DNA synthesis and GM-CFC growth. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of DNA profiles and cytological studies in HL-60, K-562 or MRC5V2 (fibroblast) cells indicated that low doses of NCTD accelerated the G1/S phase transition, while higher doses or prolonged incubations inhibited the cell cycle at the G2/M phases or during the formation of postmitotic daughter cells. Electron microscopy revealed that NCTD impaired the neogenesis of chromatin material and nuclear membrane during the M/G1 phase transition in K-562 cells. The biphasic effect of NCTD may be due to inhibition of PP2A activity, which regulates the cell cycle, both at the restriction point and at the G2 and M phases. Our data provide new insight into the cellular and molecular actions of NCTD, and partly explain its therapeutical effects in cancer patients.","['Liu, X H', 'Blazsek, I', 'Comisso, M', 'Legras, S', 'Marion, S', 'Quittet, P', 'Anjo, A', 'Wang, G S', 'Misset, J L']","['Liu XH', 'Blazsek I', 'Comisso M', 'Legras S', 'Marion S', 'Quittet P', 'Anjo A', 'Wang GS', 'Misset JL']","[""Institut du Cancer et d'Immunogenetique, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/*pharmacology', '*Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00050-X [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00050-x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995 Jun;31A(6):953-63. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00050-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent publications of international mortality and incidence data, along with the expanding U.S. database, make a comprehensive assessment of leukaemia patterns particularly timely. Total leukaemia mortality has dramatically declined among children and increased among the elderly, while incidence has declined somewhat (for Caucasian and African-American females) or remained stable (for African-American males) during the past two decades in the United States. Population-based 5-year relative survival for total leukaemia has risen substantially among children since the mid-1970s, and improved slightly among other age groups in the U.S., where survival is consistently higher among Caucasians than African-Americans, but differs little by gender. In a detailed assessment by leukaemia subtype, some important differences in geographic, racial/ethnic, age and trend patterns are identified, suggesting that the subtypes may have different aetiologic factors. Proven and suspected risk factors cannot explain more than a small fraction of the observed geographic and temporal variation in incidence. Several noteworthy subtype-specific characteristics or trends warrant further investigation: for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), increasing incidence, with higher rates in Spanish and Latino populations; for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), declining incidence, with dramatically low rates among Asians; for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), increasing incidence among African-American males; and for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), declining rates among Caucasian but not among African-Americans.","['Groves, F D', 'Linet, M S', 'Devesa, S S']","['Groves FD', 'Linet MS', 'Devesa SS']","['Analytical Studies Biostatistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00024-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00024-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995 Jun;31A(6):941-9. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00024-0.,,['Eur J Cancer. 1995 Jun;31A(6):863-7.

Its deduced sequence is approximately 40% identical to previously cloned receptors for the beta chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), RANTES, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which are chemoattractants for blood leukocytes, and is 83% identical to the product of the orphan rat cDNA RBS 11. Like the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor, CMK-BRL1 is encoded by a small, single-copy gene that maps to chromosome 3p21 and is expressed in leukocytes. However, two screening assays with a broad panel of chemokines failed to identify its ligand. CMKBRL1 mRNA was detectable by Northern blot hybridization in neutrophils and monocytes, but not eosinophils, and was also found in eight solid organs that were tested with particularly high expression in brain. The RNA distribution of the known beta chemokine receptors was overlapping but distinct from that of CMKBRL1. MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor mRNA was detectable in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and in all eight solid organs tested, with particularly high expression in placenta, lung, and liver. MCP-1 receptor mRNA was found in monocytes, lung, liver, and pancreas. These results suggest that the ligand for the putative CMKBRL1 receptor is a beta chemokine that targets both neutrophils and monocytes.

By a gel-shift binding assay, we identified an activity in HeLa nuclear extracts that recognizes and binds to oligonucleotides substituted with 2-chloroadenine (ClAde). The activity was specific for ClAde residues because control oligomers did not readily compete out the complex. The binding factor was a monomeric protein that was resistant to inactivation by heating at 45 degrees C but sensitive to heating at 65 degrees C, proteinase K treatment, and 5 mM ZnCl2. This protein, designated ClAde recognition protein (CARP), appeared to be related to a protein that recognized other forms of DNA damage. Gel-shift binding reactions with ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated oligomers revealed a UV-specific protein/DNA complex that had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the CARP/DNA complex, and CARP binding to ClAde-containing oligomers was readily competed out by UV-irradiated DNA. Moreover, CARP activity was present in extracts prepared from UV-sensitive xeroderma pigmentosum group A cells but not in a subset of cells from group E, suggesting that CARP was similar to a previously described repair associated factor, xeroderma pigmentosum-E binding factor. Our findings support a possible repair process for ClAde residues incorporated into cellular DNA.","['Hentosh, P', 'Tibudan, M', 'Grippo, P']","['Hentosh P', 'Tibudan M', 'Grippo P']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Biology, Chicago Medical School, Illinois 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '1839-18-5 (2-chloroadenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.2940130407 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1995 Aug;13(4):245-53. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940130407.,,,['CA55414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using the K562 human leukaemia cell line and its multidrug resistant subline K562/E15B, differentiation was examined along two different pathways, megakaryocyte in response to treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and erythroid in response to treatment with sodium butyrate, in the same cell line. P-glycoprotein expression was increased in the multidrug resistant K562/E15B subline, but not induced in the parental K562 cell line. However, both treatments conferred a different phenotype on the drug resistant subline. TPA treatment caused an increase in P-glycoprotein, increased drug resistance and decreased rhodamine-123 accumulation which was verapamil sensitive, demonstrating that TPA induced a fully functional P-glycoprotein. However, sodium butyrate treatment caused an increase in P-glycoprotein without increased drug resistance or without decreased rhodamine-123 accumulation suggesting that the P-glycoprotein induced by sodium butyrate was nonfunctional. These results stress the importance of examining not only the expression of P-glycoprotein in cells, but also the function of the P-glycoprotein induced.","['Marks, D C', 'Davey, M W', 'Davey, R A', 'Kidman, A D']","['Marks DC', 'Davey MW', 'Davey RA', 'Kidman AD']","['Neurobiology Unit, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Epirubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1995/08/08 00:00,1995/08/08 00:01,['1995/08/08 00:00'],"['1995/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)00157-U [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)00157-u [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Aug 8;50(4):475-80. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00157-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In DNase I footprinting analysis, a nuclear factor (octamer binding transcription factor, Oct-1) bound at -42 bp (ATTTGCAT) both before and after retinoic-acid-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. One DNA-protein complex was formed by DNA mobility shift assay, and the level of Oct-1 decreased during retinoic-acid-induced differentiation. In the cycloheximide-treated HL-60 cells, the level of Oct-1 also reduced.

Analysis with clinicopathologic correlation of 152 fine-needle aspiration biopsies of supraclavicular lymph nodes.,727-30,"OBJECTIVE: The left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node) may be involved by metastatic malignancies, including those of abdominal or pelvic origin. Almost all previous studies have been based on examination of surgically sampled tissue or postmortem examination. To our knowledge, there has not been a study for nearly 40 years addressing the metastatic pattern to the left supraclavicular lymph node. Furthermore, there has been no study comparing left with right supraclavicular lymph node metastasis or the utilization of fine-needle aspiration biopsy to samples these sites. DESIGN: A retrospective review of 152 fine-needle aspiration biopsies of supraclavicular lymph nodes was performed, and the neoplasms were grouped into six diagnostic categories from five primary regions. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 2 years to 94 years (average, 55 years) and consisted of 66 males and 83 females. Three patients were biopsied twice. Of the 152 fine-needle aspirations, 87 (57.2%) were of the left supraclavicular lymph node and 65 (42.8%) of the right supraclavicular lymph node. Of the 96 biopsies positive for malignancy, 58 (60.4%) were biopsies of the left and 38 (39.6%) were of the right supraclavicular lymph nodes. Sixteen of 19 pelvic tumors and all six primary abdominal malignancies metastasized to the left supraclavicular lymph node. Thorax, breast, and head and neck malignancies showed no differences in metastatic patterns to the right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Ten patients (10.4% of positive nodes) had a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, or Hodgkin's disease. Six patients (7.1% of positive nodes) had a metastasis of unknown primary site, and 19 cases (19.8%) had acute or chronic inflammation; seven of the latter cases demonstrated acid-fast bacilli in the aspirated smears. CONCLUSIONS: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent initial procedure in the workup of an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node. Our study confirmed that malignancies originating in the pelvis or abdomen were significantly more likely to metastasize to the left supraclavicular lymph node and that the primary site and types of malignancies that involved the left supraclavicular lymph node were different from those involving the right supraclavicular lymph node.","['Cervin, J R', 'Silverman, J F', 'Loggie, B W', 'Geisinger, K R']","['Cervin JR', 'Silverman JF', 'Loggie BW', 'Geisinger KR']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, East Carolina School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858-4354, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pelvic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Shoulder']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1995 Aug;119(8):727-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound has the formula: C27H39NO4S2.1:2C6H8O6, a M. W. of 858 and is structurally similar to verapamil, an established inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (PGP). We have compared the MDR modulating properties of Ro44-5912 with verapamil in P388ADR cells. Doxorubicin concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition of growth (IC50) for P388ADR cells was found to be 24 microM. In contrast, treatment of P388ADR cells with Doxorubicin and 3 microM verapamil decreased the IC50 value to 2.5 microM. A further decrease was observed with 3 microM Ro44-5912 treatment, where an IC50 value of 1.1 microM was obtained. Doxorubicin accumulation was also determined by flow cytometry in order to determine whether the increased levels of chemosensitivity observed for Ro44-5912 were reflected by increased cellular drug uptake. The results revealed that Ro44-5912, at equivalent concentration, increased doxorubicin accumulation in P388ADR cells beyond that obtained with verapamil whereas no effects were seen with the parental P388 cells. The effect of Ro44-5912 on the binding of C219 monoclonal antibody to PGP in MDR cells was also studied and found not to decrease C219 expression on P388ADR cells.","['De Jong, G', 'Gelmon, K', 'Bally, M', 'Goldie, J', 'Mayer, L']","['De Jong G', 'Gelmon K', 'Bally M', 'Goldie J', 'Mayer L']","['Department of Medical Oncology Laboratory Operations, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Ro 44-5912)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1995 May-Jun;15(3):911-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of distinct protein kinases during different stages of this differentiation was studied by the use of H8, staurosporine and genistein as inhibitors of PKA, PKC and PTK respectively. In dbcAMP-mediated differentiation, the PKA activity of uninduced cells is crucial for the induction of differentiation, but therefore its significance drastically declines and a more important role is played by PKC and PTK. In RA-mediated differentiation, the native state of PKA and PKC activities are necessary and of similar importance for induction. However, the differentiation is enhanced when, following induction, the activities of PKA and PTK are normal and the activity of PKC, in contrast, is temporary suppressed. At the phenotypic stage the effect of inhibition of protein kinases on maturation is in the order PTK > PKC > PKA for the dbcAMP-mediated differentiation and PKC > PKA > PTK for the RA-mediated differentiation. The results indicate that protein kinase activities during differentiation are stage specific and this specificity depends on the inducer used.","['Savickiene, J', 'Gineitis, A', 'Shanbhag, V P', 'Stigbrand, T']","['Savickiene J', 'Gineitis A', 'Shanbhag VP', 'Stigbrand T']","['Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genistein', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1995 May-Jun;15(3):687-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitamins, cancer and receptors.",1-15,"Vitamin A is metabolized to several biologically active compounds, the best known of which is retinoic acid. This compound has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor cells and to induce a more differentiated phenotype in several tumor types. Vitamin D is metabolized to the active compound 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This vitamin is well-known for its role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the body. Recently it has been shown that vitamin D3 can also inhibit tumor cell replication and stimulate differentiation of selected tumor types. Retinoic acid is being used clinically to treat promyelocytic leukemia, head and neck tumors as well as cervical dysplasia. Use of vitamin D3 clinically has been restricted by its affect on calcium metabolism. Recently, however, new analogs of vitamin D3 have been developed which have much less calcium mobilizing activity, yet still retain their tumor inhibitory properties. The action of both of these vitamins is mediated by nuclear receptors which have the same structure as steroid receptors. There are three nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha, beta, and gamma), but only one vitamin D3 nuclear receptor. These receptors are expressed in very small amounts. Since the ligand should be in vast excess of receptor (ie not limiting), we explored the possibility that response to vitamin A might be mediated by control of RAR expression. Using B16 mouse melanoma cells as a model system, we found that RAR alpha and gamma mRNAs were constitutively expressed. RAR beta mRNA was induced by treatment of the cells with RA. Induction of RAR beta mRNA occurred within 1h and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. The mRNA for all three RARs was dramatically decreased with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP treatment and could not be rescued by addition of RA. Analysis of RAR gamma revealed that this decrease occurred within 1h of exposure to 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and was not blocked by simultaneous treatment with cycloheximide. Nuclear extracts from cyclic AMP-treated cells showed a large decrease in protein binding to a retinoic acid response element (RARE) oligonucleotide compared to control cells. This correlated with a marked reduction of RA-stimulated RARE-reporter gene activity in transfected cells which were treated with cyclic AMP. Pre-treatment of B16 cells with cyclic AMP prior to RA addition dramatically reduced induction of PKC alpha, an early marker of RA-induced cell differentiation. Thus, cyclic AMP can antagonize the physiological actions of RA via its ability to inhibit RAR expression.","['Niles, R M']",['Niles RM'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV 25755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Stability', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin A/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4899-0949-7_1 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1995;375:1-15. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4899-0949-7_1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, C57BL/10-H-2k (B10.BR) mice were found to be resistant to E-55+ MuLV-induced lymphoma despite the fact that these mice become persistently infected. This resistance to lymphomagensis is mediated by the anti-virus immune response since immunosuppressed mice progress to develop disease. The protective immune response in B10.BR mice is bimodal with respect to time after virus infection. The early immune response results in a dramatic decrease in the number of virus-infected cells within 4-8 weeks after infection. This decrease in virus-infected cells occurs in immunocompetent mice from strains that are either resistant (B10.BR) or susceptible (BALB.K) to E-55+ MuLV-induced disease. Subsequently, susceptible mice develop an increase in infected cells, whereas no increase in infected cells occurs in resistant mice despite the fact that they are persistently infected. This later phase of resistance in B10.BR appears to be mediated by T cells. Since B10.BR and BALB.K both express the H-2k haplotype, resistance appears to be mediated by a non-H-2-linked gene(s).

The experimental design required inoculation of neonatal Fisher rats with a molecular clone of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV; FB29) which resulted in virus-specific immunotolerance, while infection of adult rats lead to a virus-specific humoral and cellular immune response. Adoptive transfer of virus-specific immune cells from immunized to immunotolerant (i.e., neonatally inoculated) rats was performed at around 15 days postpartum, a time when retroviral titers had already reached high levels in serum, spleen, thymus, and central nervous system (CNS). Seven days post-transfer (dpt), virus titers began to decline by 3-5 logs first in sera and at around 11-15 dpt, in spleens and thymi. Approximately 19 days post-transfer viral titers increased again. In the CNS, viral titers appeared not to change after adoptive transfer, although we observed an influx of activated T-cells and natural killer cells (NK-cells), but not of B-cells, into the CNS as well as an upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules between 8 and 21 dpt on both microglia and other brain cells. From these data we conclude that MuLV-infected cells of lymphoid organs can be eliminated by an antiviral immune response.

It was previously shown that activation of 2-5A synthetase gene expression by IFN-gamma in the 3Cl8 cell, a clone resistant to IFN-alpha,beta (type I), correlates with the formation of two major complexes, designated Fg and Fc, that bind to the interferon-stimulated responsive element of the gene. Conversely, in a clone resistant to both types of IFNs (3 gamma R8), no induction of DNA-protein complexes or of 2-5A synthetase gene expression was detected. In the present report the Fg complex has been characterized as including the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), whereas the Fc factor, present also in control cells, has been characterized as composed of IRF-2. Incubation of cell extracts with antibodies to IRF-1 abolishes the formation of the Fg complex, and antibodies to IRF-2 abolish the formation of the Fc complex. Moreover, in the 3Cl8 cell, IFN-gamma is able to induce in few minutes the formation of a complex between a DNA element identified as the IFN-gamma activation site (GAS), present on the IRF-1 gene promoter, and the STAT1 protein. These findings suggest that in cells resistant to type I IFN, IFN-gamma is able, through the activation of the STAT1 protein, to induce the expression of the IRF-1 factor which in turn seems to be sufficient to transactivate the 2-5A synthetase gene.","['Coccia, E M', 'Marziali, G', 'Stellacci, E', 'Perrotti, E', 'Ilari, R', 'Orsatti, R', 'Battistini, A']","['Coccia EM', 'Marziali G', 'Stellacci E', 'Perrotti E', 'Ilari R', 'Orsatti R', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)71384-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.1384 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Aug 1;211(1):113-22. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1384.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of results in a group of patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years treated at the onset of the disease with radiotherapy alone].,855-60,"January, 1972, through December, 1982, ninety-four patients with Hodgkin's disease in stages I and IIA were treated in the Dept. of Radiation Oncology of the University ""La Sapienza"", Rome. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 10 years. After careful clinical and surgical examinations comprehensive of laparosplenectomy, all patients were submitted to extended field radiation treatment. Ninety-one of 94 patients (97%) obtained complete remission. Overall survival at 10 years was 91% and independent of stage (94% in stage I and 87% in stage II), while relapse-free survival at 10 years did depend on stage (83% in stage I and 49% in stage II); the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Thirty-one of 94 patients relapsed, but fortunately 94% of them obtained a second complete remission after salvage chemotherapy. Our experience confirms the low tumorigenic potential of exclusive radiation therapy; only one of 4 secondary neoplasms (acute non-lymphatic leukemia) observed in this series had been treated with radiotherapy. The results of this study confirm the efficacy of exclusive irradiation in stage I patients, while treatment approach remains debated in stage II patients. The combination of short-time chemotherapy with curative irradiation is probably the best option to reduce both the incidence of recurrences and treatment-induced complications.","['Maurizi Enrici, R', 'Falchetto Osti, M', 'Anselmo, A P', 'Tombolini, V', 'Cartoni, C', 'Scattoni Padovan, F', 'Sbarbati, S', 'Cavaceppi, P', 'Biagini, C']","['Maurizi Enrici R', 'Falchetto Osti M', 'Anselmo AP', 'Tombolini V', 'Cartoni C', 'Scattoni Padovan F', 'Sbarbati S', 'Cavaceppi P', 'Biagini C']","['Istituto di Radiologia, Universita degli Studi La Sapienza, Roma.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Med. 1995 Jun;89(6):855-60.,,,,,,,,Morbo di Hodgkin negli stadi I e IIA.

Of particular interest is the relationship between exposure to benzene or benzene-containing liquids in the petroleum industry and leukemia risk. However, few studies have investigated cell-type-specific leukemia risk. In the present investigation, all cohort studies of petroleum workers in the United States and the United Kingdom were combined into a single database for cell-type-specific leukemia analysis. The majority of these workers were petroleum refinery employees, but production, pipeline, and distribution workers in the petroleum industry were also included. The combined cohort consisted of 208,741 petroleum workers. Between 1937 and 1989, these workers contributed a total of 4,665,361 person-years of observation. More than 56 thousand deaths were reported among these workers during the 53 years of observation. Cell-type-specific leukemia risks were calculated using a meta-analysis procedure appropriate for combining occupational cohort studies. These risks were expressed in terms of cell-type-specific leukemia standardized mortality ratios (meta-SMRs). The meta-SMR for acute myelogenous leukemia was 0.96. The lack of an increase of acute myelogenous leukemia was attributed to the low levels of benzene exposure in the petroleum industry, particularly in comparison to benzene exposure levels in some previous studies of workers in other industries, who had been found to experience increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia. Similarly, no increase in chronic myelogenous, acute lymphocytic, or chronic lymphocytic leukemias was found in petroleum workers (meta-SMRs of 0.89, 1.16, and 0.84, respectively). Meta-analyses restricted to refinery studies or to studies with at least 15 years of follow-up yielded similar results.

Pretreatment of cells with IL-3 or IL-5 for 30 min increased A23187- (5x10(-9)M) stimulated synthesis of LTB4 by three to four times over control levels. However, IL-3 or IL-5 lacked this effect when stimulated with exogenous arachidonic acid A at 10(-4)M. TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha had no priming effect on LTB4 synthesis following stimulation with either A23187 (5x10(-9)M) or AA(10(-4)M). Stimulation with the calcium ionophore (A23187)(10(-5)M) or AA(10(-4)M) following 15-h exposure to these cytokines had no effect. These results suggest that IL-3 and IL-5 increase the production of LTB4 by priming the activity of phospholipase A2(PLA2) without inducing enzymes in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Such a priming effect may be important in regulating the development of allergic and other diseases involving the inflammatory reaction.","['Matsumoto, S', 'Hamasaki, Y', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Matsumoto S', 'Hamasaki Y', 'Ichimaru T', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0952-3278(95)90071-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 1995 Jun;52(6):417-22. doi: 10.1016/0952-3278(95)90071-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSA inhibited the production of cysteinyl LTs, LTB4, and 5-HETE in intact cells in a dose-dependent manner. The synthesis of cysteinyl LTs, LTB4, and 5-HETE was also measured after the incubation of cell lysates with free AA in the absence or presence of CSA. CSA did not inhibit synthesis of cysteinyl LTs, but rather stimulated production of LTB4 and 5-HETE in cell lysate. A23187-stimulated release of incorporated [3H]AA from intact cells was not inhibited by CSA. CSA did not inhibit the synthesis of cysteinyl LTs and LTB4 when cells incubated with LTA4 as the substrate. These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of CSA on the synthesis of LTs and 5-HETE in intact cells are attributable to a modulatory action on a step in the series of intracellular events that includes the activation of 5-lipoxygenase, which are initiated by Ca2+ influx and end in the release of metabolites from the cell membrane, rather than to a direct inhibitory action on enzymes in the LT biosynthetic pathway.","['Hamasaki, Y', 'Matsumoto, S', 'Kobayashi, I', 'Zaitu, M', 'Muro, E', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Hamasaki Y', 'Matsumoto S', 'Kobayashi I', 'Zaitu M', 'Muro E', 'Ichimaru T', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '467RNW8T91 (5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukotriene B4/biosynthesis', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0952-3278(95)90063-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 1995 Jun;52(6):365-71. doi: 10.1016/0952-3278(95)90063-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to deliver this hormone by gene therapy rather than by repeated injections could provide substantial clinical and economic benefits. As a preliminary approach, we investigated in rats the expression and biological effects of transplanting autologous vascular smooth muscle cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding rat Epo cDNA. Vector-derived Epo secretion caused increases in reticulocytes, with peak levels of 7.8-9.6% around day 10 after implantation. The initial elevation in reticulocytes was followed by clinically significant increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin for up to 11 weeks. Ten control and treated animals showed mean hematocrits of 44.9 +/- 0.4% and 58.7 +/- 3.1%, respectively (P < 0.001), and hemoglobin values of 15.6 +/- 0.1 g/dl and 19.8 +/- 0.9 g/dl, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between control and treated animals in the number of white blood cells and platelets. Kidney and to a lesser extent liver are specific organs that synthesize Epo in response to tissue oxygenation. In the treated animals, endogenous Epo mRNA was largely down regulated in kidney and absent from liver. These results indicate that vascular smooth muscle cells can be genetically modified to provide treatment of anemias due to Epo deficiency and suggest that this cell type may be targeted in the treatment of other diseases requiring systemic therapeutic protein delivery.","['Osborne, W R', 'Ramesh, N', 'Lau, S', 'Clowes, M M', 'Dale, D C', 'Clowes, A W']","['Osborne WR', 'Ramesh N', 'Lau S', 'Clowes MM', 'Dale DC', 'Clowes AW']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Reticulocytes/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.17.8055 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Aug 15;92(17):8055-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.17.8055.,,,"['DK 38531/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 43727/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 42270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC41285,,,,,,,

When intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive stores were depleted by dialyzing cells with high concentrations of InsP3, ICRAC inactivated only slightly in the absence of ATP. Inclusion of ATP accelerated inactivation 2-fold. The inactivation was increased further by the ATP analogue adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, which is readily used by protein kinases, but not by 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, another ATP analogue that is not used by kinases. Neither cyclic nucleotides nor inhibition of calmodulin or tyrosine kinase prevented the inactivation. Staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide, protein kinase C inhibitors, reduced inactivation of ICRAC, whereas phorbol ester accelerated inactivation of the current. These results demonstrate that a protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation, probably through protein kinase C, inactivates ICRAC. Activation of the adenosine receptor (A3 type) in RBL cells did not evoke much Ca2+ influx or systematic activation of ICRAC. After protein kinase C was blocked, however, large ICRAC was observed in all cells and this was accompanied by large Ca2+ influx. The ability of a receptor to evoke Ca2+ entry is determined, at least in part, by protein kinase C. Antigen stimulation, which triggers secretion through a process that requires Ca2+ influx, activated ICRAC.

We have previously described a reliable experimental procedure for in vitro bone marrow treatment, based on individual adjustment of the drug dosage. The present study reveals an inhibitory action of plasma on the toxicity of mafosfamide to normal haematopoietic progenitor cells. In an initial series of 42 successive patients, determination of the CFU-GM lethal dose 95% (CFU-GM LD 95) showed this parameter to be inversely correlated to the nucleated cell concentration (NCC) (p < 0.001). Assuming the plasma content of the buffy coat cells (BC) to be higher in the less rich marrow samples, we then investigated the role of plasma in progenitor cell sensitivity to the drug. Results were as follows: (1) in the presence of 60% autologous or allogeneic plasma, CFU-GM LD 95 was increased by a factor of 2.18 +/- 0.35 or 1.98 +/- 0.23 respectively as compared to controls in a solution of 2% bovine serum albumin (p = 0.014), (2) this observation remained valid whatever the origin of the plasma and (3) the same was true whatever the nature of the cells, derived from normal donors or patients with haematological malignancies.

The monoclonal antibody (mAb), MRK16 was used to detect phenotypic Pgp expression while Fluo-3-AM was used as a fluorescent substrate in a Pgp functional transport assay. The specificity of the functional assay was examined in two vinblastine selected human leukemic cell lines (K562/VLB2.5 and CCRF-CEM/VLB50) with acquired Pgp overexpression. Downmodulation of Pgp function in these cell lines could be demonstrated with different substances (verapamil, vinblastine, trifluoperazine, cyclosporin A, progesterone and quinidine) and was proven to be consistently higher in the vinblastine selected cells than in their non-selected drug sensitive counterparts. Unexpectedly, modulator activity was also observed in drug sensitive K562 and CCRF-CEM cell lines despite the inability to detect Pgp in those cells by MRK16 flow cytometrically. Low level expression of the MDR1 gene encoding Pgp in sensitive K562 cells was however demonstrated with a sensitive RT-PCR procedure. The small effect of Pgp modulators in non-drug selected cells could therefore be attributed to low level basal expression of Pgp and illustrates the sensitivity of the functional assay. Also, the effect of various Pgp modulators on Pgp function was more pronounced in a subpopulation of Pgp expressing lymphocytes than in lymphocytes which did not express Pgp. Finally, a correlation was found between discrete variations in Pgp expression and Pgp function of CD4+ lymphocytes, underscoring the feasibility of the functional assay in a triple parametric procedure. The triple parametric assay holds promise to detect Pgp expression and function in clinical samples containing mixtures of malignant and non-malignant cells.","['Van Acker, K L', 'De Greef, C', 'Eggermont, J', 'Zhang, P', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Boogaerts, M A']","['Van Acker KL', 'De Greef C', 'Eggermont J', 'Zhang P', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Boogaerts MA']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '23D4W0B50Y (Fluo-3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/genetics', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthenes']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Aug;9(8):1398-406.,,,,['MDR1'],,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of bone resorption in MM are incompletely understood. The final pathway is the generation of activated osteoclasts within bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. To investigate the mechanisms of bone resorption in MM we established an experimental system that, including bone marrow (BM) stromal cells and bone slices, closely mimicks in vitro the in vivo BM microenvironment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from nine patients with MM, three monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and nine normal controls were cultured in this system. PBMC from patients with aggressive and bone devastating MM gave rise to multi-nucleated cells with the morphology and phenotype of osteoclasts. These cells induced bone resorption in vitro which was inhibited by the addition of calcitonin. No bone resorption was observed in cultures of PBMC from patients with MM and limited bone damage, with MGUS and from normal subjects. These findings indicate that patients with aggressive MM have a population of circulating precursors that develop into functionally active osteoclast-like cells once they come in contact with the BM microenvironment.

For comparison, we also studied the expression of these proteins in: 23 samples of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) tissue of different histological types, 10 samples of non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue (NLT), non-stimulated PBL (NS-PBL) and PHA-stimulated PBL (PHA-PBL) from three healthy donors. Samples were lysed and proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blot. The expression of cdk4 and cyclin E, both known to act in early cell cycle stage, was approximately on the same level in all groups of lymphoid pathology examined. In particular, we found that that 19 out of 24 CLL cases were cyclin E positive and all but one were cdk4 positive, ie they expressed these markers over twice the level of non-stimulated healthy PBL. The cdk1 expression was above the level seen in NS-PBL in 14 (56%) cases, but the average expression was significantly lower than in the other tissues examined, including low-grade lymphomas.

RA and PMA activate a coprecipitating kinase, respectively inducing 1.6 and 2.7-fold increases in phosphorylation of topo II in immunoprecipitates. The activity of the co-precipitating kinase is inhibited by heparin and unlabelled GTP suggesting that casein kinase II (CKII) is, at least in part, responsible for the topo II hyperphosphorylation in response to differentiation signals. Although following dephosphorylation of the enzyme with alkaline phosphatase there was virtual abrogation of activity, the differentiation associated hyperphosphorylation had little impact on the decatenation activity of topo II in nuclear extracts. There were, however detectable changes in topo II function in vivo which affected the formation of the etoposide stabilised cleavable complex, but only after PMA treatment. PMA resulted in a rapid reduction in etoposide induced cleavage, 30 min treatment with PMA reducing cleavage by 20%. However, treatment with RA for 1 or 2 h when hyperphosphorylation was maximal did not affect cleavage. Immunoband depletion assays suggested that differentiation associated changes in chromatin structure rather than alterations in the enzyme per se are responsible for the reduction in cleavable complex formation following PMA treatment. Etoposide cytotoxicity was significantly reduced following just 30 min PMA treatment, but not reduced and even possibly enhanced by retinoic acid treatment. These findings are relevant not only to the dissection of the role of topo II in differentiation but also to its exploitation as a therapeutic target.","['Chresta, C M', 'Hall, B F', 'Francis, G E']","['Chresta CM', 'Hall BF', 'Francis GE']","['Molecular Cell Pathology Laboratory, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Aug;9(8):1373-81.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

We examined expression of FL and FLT3 mRNA in a panel of some 110 continuous human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines from all major hematopoietic cell lineages by Northern blot analysis. FLT3 mRNA is expressed primarily in pre-B cell lines, myeloid and monocytic cell lines whereas FL mRNA was detected in most cell lines from all cell lineages. Analysis of FLT3 receptor protein expression examined with a specific anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry in 17 cell lines confirmed the results obtained at the mRNA level. Forty of 110 cell lines displayed both receptor and ligand mRNA suggesting a possible autocrine or intracrine stimulation.

It was then extended to the study of fresh leukemic cells and kinetic studies were performed allowing the calculation of the retention rate (RR) of anthracycline (THP-doxorubicin) into the cell nucleus. A reproducibility study confirmed the accuracy of the method. Blast cells collected in patients with acute myeloid (n = 22) or lymphoid (n = 8) leukemia, at diagnosis (n = 26), or in relapse (n = 4) have been studied.

In a minority of cases, complete suppression of the Philadelphia (Ph)-positive clone has been observed by cytogenetic investigation or by Southern blot analysis. In most instances, however, analyses by the highly sensitive two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reveal the presence of residual leukemic cells despite continuous treatment. Since PCR positivity has not been associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence, the monitoring of cells carrying the characteristic BCR/ABL rearrangement by qualitative PCR may not facilitate early identification of patients who are likely to relapse. We have therefore employed a quantitative PCR technique to monitor the BCR/ABL mRNA expression levels during the course of treatment in an attempt to assess the response to IFN-alpha at the molecular level and to provide a basis for early detection of progressive disease. Twenty CML patients who received therapy with IFN-alpha in first chronic phase of the disease were enrolled in the study. In addition, we have monitored two CML patients treated with IFN-alpha for relapse after bone marrow transplantation. Thirteen patients who displayed decreasing, constant or fluctuating levels of BCR/ABL expression during an observation period of up to 4 years (mean 25 months) have remained in hematologic remission. Two patients showed an elevation in the marker gene expression upon discontinuation of treatment, but no further increase in BCR/ABL mRNA has been observed after reinitiation of therapy with IFN, and the patients have remained in hematologic remission. In seven patients, quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses revealed increasing expression of the chimeric gene during treatment with IFN-alpha. In all seven cases, the detection of elevated BCR/ABL transcripts by quantitative PCR preceded signs of hematologic or cytogenetic disease progression by up to 8 months (median 6 months). Our data show that quantitative PCR analysis facilitates the monitoring of the response to IFN-alpha therapy and provides an effective diagnostic tool for the timely detection of recurrent disease. The employment of this technique greatly enhances the diagnostic possibilities in the management of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Lion, T', 'Gaiger, A', 'Henn, T', 'Horth, E', 'Haas, O A', 'Geissler, K', 'Gadner, H']","['Lion T', 'Gaiger A', 'Henn T', 'Horth E', 'Haas OA', 'Geissler K', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Aug;9(8):1353-60.,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,

In two of three cases, ATL cells could proliferate in the presence of autologous cell lines.

The topoisomerase II inhibitors implicated in MLL/11q23 secondary leukemias all inhibit the religation step of reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase II. This results in the stabilization of a 'cleavable complex' with double-strand DNA breaks at the point of topoisomerase II binding. This raises the possibility that the cleavable complex participates in the translocation process in MLL/11q23 secondary leukemias. Here we report that the MLL/11q23 breakpoints in 13/13 patients with secondary leukemia map to the same breakpoint cluster region (bcr) noted in de novo MLL/11q23 acute leukemias and the presence of in vivo topoisomerase II inhibitor-induced cleavage sites in MLL/11q23 bcr. We have also cloned and sequenced the breakpoint from a MLL/11q23 secondary acute leukemia. This analysis revealed sequences similar to the consensus sequence for vertebrate topoisomerase II binding and cleavage close to the 11q23 and 4q21 breakpoints.

Using probes for the MLL gene at 11q23, MLL rearrangements have been identified in 70-80% of all infant leukemias including virtually all of the cases with 11q23 translocations, as well as cases with apparently normal karyotypes. We reviewed the chromosomal pattern of 26 cases of infant leukemias (12 ALL, 12 AML, two AUL). Eleven had 11q23 translocations, five had other abnormalities, and 10 had a normal karyotype. To determine whether 11q23/MLL rearrangements were present in the leukemia cells of patients with a normal karyotype, we performed FISH and molecular studies of eight of these patients who had adequate material. Three were found to have 11q23/MLL abnormalities, two of them detected by FISH; one ALL case had a t(11;19) (q23;p13.3), and one AML case had a t(11;19) (q23;p13.1). Retrospective review confirmed the presence of the t(11;19) in a small percentage of poor quality metaphase cells in both cases. A rearrangement of the MLL gene was detected by Southern blot analysis of leukemic cells from a third patient with ALL; one cell with a deletion of 11q23 was found on karyotypic review. Therefore, in our series the actual incidence of 11q23 abnormalities in infant leukemias was 54% (14/26): 67% in ALL (8/12) and 50% in AML (6/12). Our findings suggest that most infant leukemias with apparently normal karyotypes that have a molecular rearrangement of the MLL gene are undetected subtle translocations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Thirman, M J', 'Espinosa, R 3rd', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D']","['Martinez-Climent JA', 'Thirman MJ', 'Espinosa R 3rd', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1995/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Aug;9(8):1299-304.,,,['CA-42577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['MLL'],,,,,,,,,,

Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), relative levels of the WT 1 gene expression was examined in 87 patients with acute leukemia, 25 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Significant levels of the WT 1 gene were expressed in all leukemia patients, and for CML the levels increased as the clinical phase progressed. No point mutations were found in the WT 1 gene when samples from 15 acute leukemia patients were subjected to PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. In striking contrast to acute leukemia, the levels of WT1 gene expression for NHL were significantly low or even undetectable. The levels of WT 1 gene expression inversely correlated with the prognosis of acute leukemia. The quantification of the WT 1 gene expression made it possible to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia regardless of the presence of absence of tumor-specific DNA markers. Simultaneous monitoring of MRD by RT-PCR using primers for specific DNA markers in four patients (two AML-M3 with PML/RAR-alpha, one AML-M2 with AML1/ETO, and one CML with bcr/abl) detected MRD comparable to that obtained from quantitation of WT 1 gene expression.

It occurs primarily in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and primary brain tumors. Although leptomeningeal metastasis may present with focal neurologic signs and symptoms, leptomeningeal metastasis is a disease affecting the entire neuraxis and necessitating an extent-of-disease evaluation of both the brain and spinal cord. Neuroradiographic staging of leptomeningeal metastases includes contrast-enhanced cranial computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced spine magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic myelography, and radionuclide cerebrospinal fluid flow studies. As a consequence of global neuraxis involvement, the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases requires therapy directed at all cerebrospinal fluid compartments. The treatment of leptomeningeal metastases usually includes both radiotherapy and intra-cerebrospinal fluid drug therapy. Radiotherapy is directed to regions of bulky or symptomatic central nervous system disease. Intra-cerebrospinal fluid drug therapy, using one of three available chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, cytarabine, or triethylene thiophosphoramide), is administered by a variety of schedules and either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Notwithstanding that the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases is palliative, with an expected patient survival of 6 months, it often affords stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in children with leptomeningeal metastases in whom death is usually a consequence of progressive systemic or parenchymal brain disease.","['Chamberlain, M C']",['Chamberlain MC'],"['Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego 92093-0812, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/*secondary/therapy', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/088307389501000304 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Neurol. 1995 May;10(3):191-9. doi: 10.1177/088307389501000304.,,,,,,85,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that expression of WAF1 is induced through the p53-dependent pathway; WAF1 is induced in cells with functional p53 but not in cells with either mutant p53 or no 53. Human myeloblastic leukemia cells KG-1 had no constitutive expression of p53, and irradiation did not induce p53. However, irradiation increased WAF1 expression in KG-1 cells and other cell lines containing mutant p53. The KG-1 cells constitutively produced low levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF); irradiation markedly increased the production of TNF. Notably, induction of WAF1 mRNA by irradiation was blocked by anti-TNF antibody. Furthermore, exogenously added TNF increased levels of WAF1 mRNA in these cells. Irradiation increased the rate of WAF1 transcription 3-fold, and the half-life (t1/2) of WAF1 mRNA in these cells increased from < 1 h in unirradiated cells to > 4 h in irradiated cells. These findings indicate that increased levels of WAF1 transcripts occur, at least in part, through a pathway of TNF production and that the increase in WAF1 mRNA observed after irradiation is regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Our present study strongly suggests that an alternative pathway of induction of WAF1 occurs independent of activation by p53.","['Akashi, M', 'Hachiya, M', 'Osawa, Y', 'Spirin, K', 'Suzuki, G', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Akashi M', 'Hachiya M', 'Osawa Y', 'Spirin K', 'Suzuki G', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Radiation Health, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1995/08/11 00:00,1995/08/11 00:01,['1995/08/11 00:00'],"['1995/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.32.19181 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)51963-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Aug 11;270(32):19181-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.32.19181.,,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Whether this mechanism is equally relevant as a cause of clinical chemoresistance has not been established and is currently being investigated. This review has examined the immunohistochemical and molecular biologic tools suitable for assessing P-glycoprotein expression in patient samples and methodologic issues important for evaluating the results of clinical studies. Current evidence that supports a role for P-glycoprotein in limiting the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy has been reviewed. DESIGN: Malignancies that have been successfully treated by chemotherapeutic substrates of P-glycoprotein, in which a proportion of patients still fail therapy, may be the most useful models for determining whether this drug efflux transporter is a clinically relevant cause of chemoresistance. RESULTS: Studies of acute myelogenous leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma in adults have so far provided the best evidence for a relevant role for P-glycoprotein as a cause of clinical multidrug resistance. A similar strong association has been observed between the expression of P-glycoprotein and outcome of treatment in certain malignancies in children, such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Some apparent controversies related to this issue of clinical relevance may be explained by the differences in P-glycoprotein detection techniques, methodology, and experimental designs used in different studies. Because several clinical trials have already been initiated to determine whether pharmacologic chemosensitization improves the outcome of chemotherapy in certain malignancies, the successful verification of multidrug resistance limiting the cure rates of these tumors becomes a more critical issue, and identification of those patients with lower levels of P-glycoprotein expression early in the course of their disease, when they are most likely to benefit from multidrug resistance reversal, has assumed an even greater relevance. CONCLUSION: The clinical relevance of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein may ultimately be confirmed by the successful prevention of chemotherapy failure by chemosensitizers that specifically reverse this drug efflux mechanism.","['Chan, H S', 'DeBoer, G', 'Haddad, G', 'Gallie, B L', 'Ling, V']","['Chan HS', 'DeBoer G', 'Haddad G', 'Gallie BL', 'Ling V']","['University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1995 Apr;9(2):275-318.,,,['CA-37130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['MDR1', 'mdr1a', 'mdr2', 'pgp1', 'pgp3']",,141,,,,,,,,

The role of the MDR phenotype in clinical resistance is also not clearly demonstrated, because of the frequent association of other markers of bad prognosis on the same subset of cells (CD34, CD7 in leukemia). Hematologic malignancies are the most extensively studied tumors for drug resistance, and they could be a model for the therapeutic use of modifier agents.

These studies have led to the conclusion that the cellular origin or pathogenesis of ILL/IDL and DSCCL is distinctly different from that of FSCCL: (1) FSCCL is a neoplastic counterpart of follicular center cells (FCC) of secondary follicles because of the presence of CD10 and bcl-2 gene rearrangement and the absence of CD5 and bcl-1 gene rearrangement; (2) DSCCL and ILL/IDL are a neoplastic counterpart of mantle zone (MZ) B lymphocytes because of the presence of CD5 and bcl-1 gene rearrangement and absence of CD10 and bcl-2 gene rearrangement; and (3) FSCCL scarcely develops into DSCCL, and the previously proposed concept that DSCCL represents a diffuse counterpart of FSCCL does not hold good. These results indicate that DSCCL and ILL/IDL are identical, derived from primary follicular cells or MZB cells of secondary follicles, and should be unified under MZB lymphocyte-derived lymphomas. They are distinguished from FCC-derived lymphomas in morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic features.

The transcription level controlled by this vector was evaluated in six different cell lines using a transient expression assay of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The CAT activity of the pKX vector was compared to the other common expression vectors, namely pMSG (driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus LTR), pcDL-SR alpha (SV40 promoter/enhancer and HTLV-I LTR), pcDNAI (cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer) and pCAT-Control (SV40 promoter/enhancer).

In different mammalian cell lines, the highest efficiency of expression of the pKX vector was observed in the human T-cell lines, Jurkat and CEM, although the expression of pcDL-SR alpha-CAT in those cell lines was in the same range. The expression of the pKX vector driven by a non-viral promoter and/or enhancer can be as efficient as that driven by a viral promoter and/or enhancer.

These data suggest that PI 3-kinase may play a critical role during commitment of MEL cells to erythroid differentiation.","['Ai, Z', 'Misra, S', 'Susa, M', 'Varticovski, L', 'Cohen, C M']","['Ai Z', 'Misra S', 'Susa M', 'Varticovski L', 'Cohen CM']","[""Department of Biomedical Research, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02135, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Androstadienes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71252-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1252 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Aug;219(2):454-60. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1252.,,,"['CA 53094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 24382/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow analysis showed promyelocyte-like myeloblasts with rare Auer rods and very few granula. CD2 antigen was not expressed in bone marrow blasts. Karyotype analysis revealed a complex pattern of chromosomal aberrations without the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) specific translocation t(15;17) (q22;q21). Southern blot analysis revealed a rearrangement of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus. Reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed the initial diagnosis of PML by amplification of the PML-specific PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript. CONCLUSION: This case report confirms that a characteristic translocation t(15;17) is not always detectable in PML blasts by karyotype analysis despite presence of specific PML/RAR alpha-transcripts.

He tolerated this treatment well but went on to develop grade II skin GVHD. Polymerase chain reaction studies of DNA microsatellites of the autologous LAK cells showed that they were of donor origin. The patient remained well for 9 months until, immediately following the introduction of prednisolone for his persistent GVHD, he relapsed.

We and others have shown that this form of ADCC is unusual in that phagocytosis, rather than extracellular lysis, appears to play the major role in target cell killing. In this study, we asked whether the phagocytic form of cytotoxicity seen with ADCC could occur in the absence of an opsonizing antibody. We now report that, whereas cell lines derived from solid tumors are often resistant to antibody-independent cytotoxicity, malignant cells of lymphoid origin appear particularly susceptible to such antibody-independent killing. We found that all of nine lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested in a total of 35 experiments, plus all four samples of fresh leukemic blasts, were consistently susceptible to antibody-independent MDM cytotoxicity. Antibody-independent cytotoxicity against these cells was efficient (40%-63% killing) at effector: target (E:T) ratios as low as 2:1. Like ADCC, antibody-independent cytotoxicity involved phagocytosis of target cells, as demonstrated by ingestion of fluorescently labeled targets and analysis by flow cytometry. At the time of phagocytosis, the majority of target cells retained membrane integrity, as indicated by the direct transfer of intracellular [51Cr]chromate from radiolabeled targets to phagocytosing MDM, without release of the label into the medium. However, in contrast to ADCC, we found that the degree of antibody-independent cytotoxicity was not a function of the E:T ratio. Instead, a constant proportion of the available target cells were killed regardless of the E:T ratio, suggesting that target cell recognition, rather than effector cell potency, might be the limiting factor in determining cytotoxicity. In additional experiments, we have also identified a second tumor cell type, nueroblastoma, as being susceptible to antibody-independent phagocytosis (all of five cell lines tested, cytotoxicity 40%-93%, E:T = 3:1). Our data thus indicate that the cytotoxicity induced by rhMCSF is not confined to antibody-mediated killing, and that phagocytosis can play a significant role in target cell destruction even in the absence of opsonizing antibody.","['Munn, D H', 'Cheung, N K']","['Munn DH', 'Cheung NK']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01788959 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Jul;41(1):46-52. doi: 10.1007/BF01788959.,,,"['CA-33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53624/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the cytotoxic ability of mAb FC-2.15, its cell-surface binding properties and endocytosis in Ag2.15-expressing (Ag2.15+) cells were investigated. A 51Cr-release assay was used to test the FC-2.15-mediated cytotoxicity. When human serum was used as source of complement, FC-2.15 exerted a strong cytotoxic effect against human Ag2.15+ cells such as MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), primary breast carcinoma cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The mAb concentration range was 1-50 micrograms/ml. Cytotoxicity was completely abolished when complement was inactivated. Only 3.8 +/- 2.9% of MCF-7 cells survived the treatment with FC-2.15 in the presence of human serum. A flow-cytometry assay was performed to study the Ag2.15 expression of the surviving cells and they were found to be Ag2.15-. FC-2.15 did not mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity when different effector cells were used. Scatchard analysis with 125I-FC-2.15 on MCF-7 cells demonstrated an affinity constant of 6.9 x 10(7) M-1 and 2.8 x 10(6) antigenic sites/cell. 125I-FC-2.15 was internalized to cytoplasmic vesicles reaching a maximum of 27% after 6 h incubation, followed by the release of labeled degradation products to the supernatant. FC-2.15 appears to exert its cytotoxic effect mainly in the presence of human complement, it reacts with intermediate affinity with a high-density surface antigen, and it is slowly internalized by Ag2.15+ cells.","['Ballare, C', 'Barrio, M', 'Portela, P', 'Mordoh, J']","['Ballare C', 'Barrio M', 'Portela P', 'Mordoh J']","['Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01788955 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Jul;41(1):15-22. doi: 10.1007/BF01788955.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that beta-lapachone, at concentrations of less than 8 microM, induces cell death with characteristics of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines. This effect of beta-lapachone was also observed in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). beta-Lapachone-induced apoptosis is independent of p53 expression, and ectopic overexpression of bcl-2 did not confer significant resistance to beta-lapachone. Among other human carcinoma and adenoma cell lines tested, human breast and ovary carcinoma showed sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of beta-lapachone without manifesting signs of apoptosis. These results suggest that beta-lapachone is a potential compound to be added to cancer chemotherapy, particularly for prostate cancer.","['Li, C J', 'Wang, C', 'Pardee, A B']","['Li CJ', 'Wang C', 'Pardee AB']","['Division of Cell Growth and Regulation, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4707-32-8 (beta-lapachone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Sep 1;55(17):3712-5.,,,['AI-35511/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We show that beta-lapachone can induce apoptosis in certain cells, such as in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and human prostate cancer (DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP) cells, as also described by Li et al. (Cancer Res., 55: 0000-0000, 1995). Characteristic 180-200-bp oligonucleosome DNA laddering and fragmented DNA-containing apoptotic cells via flow cytometry and morphological examinations were observed in 4 h in HL-60 cells after a 4-h, > or = 0.5 microM beta-lapachone exposure. HL-60 cells treated with camptothecin or topotecan resulted in greater apoptotic DNA laddering and apoptotic cell populations than comparable equitoxic concentrations of beta-lapachone, although beta-lapachone was a more effective Topo I inhibitor. beta-Lapachone treatment (4 h, 1-5 microM) resulted in a block at G0/G1, with decreases in S and G2/M phases and increases in apoptotic cell populations over time in HL-60 and three separate human prostate cancer (DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP) cells. Similar treatments with topotecan or camptothecin (4 h, 1-5 microM) resulted in blockage of cells in S and apoptosis. Thus, beta-lapachone causes a block in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in cells before, or at early times during, DNA synthesis. These events are p53 independent, since PC-3 and HL-60 cells are null cells, LNCaP are wild-type, and DU-145 contain mutant p53, yet all undergo apoptosis after beta-lapachone treatment. Interestingly, beta-lapachone treatment of p53 wild type-containing prostate cancer cells (i.e., LNCaP) did not result in the induction of nuclear levels of p53 protein, as did camptothecin-treated cells. Like other Topo I inhibitors, beta-lapachone may induce apoptosis by locking Topo I onto DNA, blocking replication fork movement, and inducing apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion. beta-Lapachone and its derivatives, as well as other Topo I inhibitors, have potential clinical utility alone against human leukemia and prostate cancers.","['Planchon, S M', 'Wuerzberger, S', 'Frydman, B', 'Witiak, D T', 'Hutson, P', 'Church, D R', 'Wilding, G', 'Boothman, D A']","['Planchon SM', 'Wuerzberger S', 'Frydman B', 'Witiak DT', 'Hutson P', 'Church DR', 'Wilding G', 'Boothman DA']","['Department of Human Oncology, School of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '4707-32-8 (beta-lapachone)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Naphthoquinones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Time Factors', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Sep 1;55(17):3706-11.,,,['R01 CA092250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC4807624,,,,,['NIHMS761837'],,

However, non-responders still account for up to 80% of those patients receiving IL-2. A high concentration of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is commonly found in the blood of such patients. We investigated the possibility that high sIL-2R concentration pretreatment may interfere with the bioavailability of IL-2. The mean concentration of sIL-2R in plasma from patients with MM, RCC and head and neck cancer was 3378 U ml-1, 8778 U ml-1 and 764 U ml-1 respectively, compared with 1315 U ml-1 in plasma from healthy volunteers. Inclusion of plasma from patients with RCC and MM patient plasma in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte leukaemic (CTLL) cell/IL-2 assays inhibited the ability of CTLL cells to respond to IL-2, and an inverse correlation was found between the concentration of sIL-2R and the growth response of CTLL cell to IL-2 (r = -0.86, P = 0.003). Plasma with soluble IL-2R concentrations greater than 3000 U ml-1 produced a reduction in cell growth of more than 50% when included in CTLL IL-2 assays. The addition of increasing concentrations of IL-2 to cultures containing suppressive plasma failed to restore CTLL cell growth response to normal. Failure to saturate sIL-2R by exogenous IL-2 addition therefore suggests that another factor, initially present at a concentration similar to the sIL-2R concentration, is responsible for the observed effect. Determination of the suppressive effect of patient plasma as presented here may allow more effective IL-2 dosing schedules.","['Gooding, R', 'Riches, P', 'Dadian, G', 'Moore, J', 'Gore, M']","['Gooding R', 'Riches P', 'Dadian G', 'Moore J', 'Gore M']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/blood', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/blood', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/blood', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.354 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 Aug;72(2):452-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.354.,,,,,,,PMC2033994,,,,,,,

The structure-activity relationships seen with this series, including those for four sets of positional or stereoisomers, indicate that specific receptor proteins are unlikely as targets for anti-tumour lipid (ATL) action. Additional data confirm the lack of involvement of the platelet-activating factor receptor in particular and suggest that metabolic stability is a most important determinant of ATL activity. More detailed studies, with 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET18-OCH3) and (+/-)-2-(Hydroxy[tetrahydro-2-(octadecyloxy)methylfuran-2- yl]methoxyphosphinyloxy)-N,N,N,-trimethylethaniminium hydroxide (SRI 62-834), suggest three different modes of activity, depending on drug concentration and exposure time. Low doses of up to 5 microM in standard serum-containing medium cause population growth arrest after prolonged exposure. Growth arrest was associated with a leaky G2/M block as determined by flow cytometry. These effects are reversible. Intermediate concentrations (5-40 microM) were cytotoxic, causing a net reduction in cell numbers after 2-3 days. At even higher concentrations, all lipids caused rapid, direct membrane lysis. When the clonogenic assay was used to assess the effects of ATLs, most agents reduced colony formation at concentrations above 5 microM. However, some compounds proved stimulatory at nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that they might possess mitogenic properties.

The only major complication was severe bone marrow suppression; infectious episodes occurred in 14 patients (58%) and three died of sepsis and/or bleeding. The observed non-hematologic toxicities included hematuria, an elevation of serum amylase, nausea/vomiting, and angitis. In addition, one patient showed abnormal cardiac function.

Twenty-one patients presented with incomplete puberty and 85 presented with small testicles (< 20 mL). Of the 109 patients, 43 had elevated concentrations of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or serum FSH and leutinizing hormone. Compared with survivors of solid tumors, the patients surviving acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had inferior testicular status. This was also the case even when those treated with testicular radiotherapy were excluded. Twenty-six patients were receiving testosterone substitution therapy at the time of the study; 25 of whom were survivors of ALL. The probability of normospermia was 50% if both testicular volume and serum FSH were within normal limits and 0% if they were abnormal. Of the 86 patients over 18 years of age, 16 had evidence of normal testicular function. Of these 16, 8 patients had normospermia, only 1 of whom was a survivor of ALL. These findings suggest that ALL survivors have inferior testicular function compared with patients surviving solid tumors. Our findings confirm that testicular radiotherapy inevitably results in testicular damage, the degree of which is generally severe but variable in some individuals.

The highest mortality rates (between 6 and 7.5/100,000 boys, between 5 and 6/10,000 girls) for all childhood neoplasms were registered in Latin American countries (Uruguay, Cuba, Argentina, Costa Rica), Kuwait, New Zealand and Singapore. Rates were low in most developed countries, such as Canada, U.S.A., Australia, Japan and Israel (3.5 to 4.5/100,000). The pattern was similar for leukaemias, which account for approximately 50% of all childhood cancer mortality. From the 1960s onwards, a 50% decline in childhood cancer mortality was observed in the U.S.A. and Canada, and substantial declines were also observed in other developed countries, such as Australia, Israel and Japan. The pattern was much less favourable for other areas of the world, including Latin America and a few countries from Asia for which there were data. These declines in childhood cancer mortality are essentially attributable to improved management of the disease. The delay observed in the decline in mortality for most developing countries emphasises the scope and the importance of extending adequate treatments for childhood cancers to these areas of the world.","['Levi, F', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Lucchini, F', 'Negri, E', 'Boyle, P']","['Levi F', 'La Vecchia C', 'Lucchini F', 'Negri E', 'Boyle P']","['Registre vaudois des tumeurs, Institut universitaire de medecine sociale et preventive, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Developing Countries', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kuwait/epidemiology', 'Latin America/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(94)00534-C [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(94)00534-c [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995;31A(5):771-82. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(94)00534-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cDNA for a novel receptor of this kind consisting of 327 amino acids was isolated from a human blood monocyte cDNA library. The polypeptide, termed monocyte-derived receptor 15 (MDR15), is an alternative form of the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1) encoded by a human Burkitt's lymphoma cDNA [Dobner, Wolf, Emrich and Lipp (1992) Eur. J. Immunol. 22, 2795-2799]. MDR15 and BLR1 cDNAs differ in the 5' region, where the open reading frame of MDR15 is shorter by 45 codons. Southern-blot analysis indicates that the two transcripts for MDR15 and BLR1 are encoded by the same gene. Northern-blot analysis using a probe that hybridizes with both mRNAs demonstrated high-level expression in chronic B-lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells and, to a lesser extent, peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes. Reverse transcription-PCR studies with MDR15- and BLR1-specific primers showed similar levels of transcripts for both receptors in RNA that was positive in Northern-blot analysis. MDR15 and BLR1 have high structural similarity to receptors for human IL-8 (about 40% amino acid identity) and other chemokines. However, none of a series of radiolabelled chemokines (IL-8, NAP-2, GRO alpha, PF4, IP10, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, I-309, RANTES and MIP-1 alpha) and other ligands (C3a and leukotriene B4) bound to Jurkat transfectants that stably expressed either MDR15 or BLR1 mRNA. The fact that MDR15 and BLR1 are expressed on leucocytes and show marked sequence similarity to chemokine receptors suggests the existence of as yet unidentified chemokines. Alternative transcript formation affecting the 5'-terminal part of the coding region may be a way to modify ligand-binding selectivity.","['Barella, L', 'Loetscher, M', 'Tobler, A', 'Baggiolini, M', 'Moser, B']","['Barella L', 'Loetscher M', 'Tobler A', 'Baggiolini M', 'Moser B']","['Theodor-Kocher Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Complementary', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR5', 'Receptors, Chemokine', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3090773 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Aug 1;309 ( Pt 3):773-9. doi: 10.1042/bj3090773.,,,,"['BLR1', 'MDR15']",['GENBANK/X68829'],,PMC1135699,,,,,,,

The Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Working Committee.,428-31,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the conclusions of a 1991 study, which showed that adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission had similar leukemia-free survival rates when treated with chemotherapy or HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation, remain valid after more than 4 years of additional follow-up. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of patients using left-truncated Cox regression to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and time to treatment. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Chemotherapy recipients were 484 consecutive patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission treated in 44 hospitals in Germany that were participating in two consecutive trials of the German Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Therapy Trials Group. Transplant recipients were 234 consecutive recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission in 98 centers, worldwide, reporting data to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. INTERVENTIONS: Intensive combination chemotherapy or HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation preceded by high-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation. MEASUREMENTS: Relapse, treatment-related mortality, and leukemia-free survival rate 9 years after first complete remission. RESULTS: The conclusions of our previous analyses were confirmed. Actuarial relapse probabilities at 9 years were 66% (95% CI, 61% to 70%) for chemotherapy and 30% (CI, 22% to 37%) for transplantation (P < 0.0001). The leukemia-free survival rates at 9 years were 32% (CI, 27% to 37%) for chemotherapy and 34% (CI, 28% to 40%) for transplantation (P > 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer relapses but more treatment-related deaths were seen with transplantation than with chemotherapy. Thus, leukemia-free survival rates were similar in adults receiving transplantation and adults receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission.","['Zhang, M J', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gale, R P', 'Messerer, D', 'Klein, J P', 'Loffler, H', 'Sobocinski, K A', 'Thiel, E', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Zhang MJ', 'Hoelzer D', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gale RP', 'Messerer D', 'Klein JP', 'Loffler H', 'Sobocinski KA', 'Thiel E', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-123-6-199509150-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1995 Sep 15;123(6):428-31. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-123-6-199509150-00006.,,,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These tumor cells produced IFN constitutively, and mice had persistently high levels of IFN in the circulation. We examined the IFN-induced host mechanisms responsible for the local inhibition of growth of these IFN-alpha-transfected FLC and some of the unusual systemic effects of constant interferonemia such as extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, an increase in myeloid cells in the spleen, and persistently elevated splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity. In addition, both DBA/2 +/bg and beige mice developed a rapid and specific resistance to intravenous challenge with parental FLC. In previous experiments DBA/2 beige mice could not be protected by exogenous IFN-alpha/beta. The differences in the response of mice to the constitutive production of IFN-alpha by IFN-alpha-transfected tumor cells and their response to exogenous IFN is discussed in terms of the effects of IFN on the host and of antitumor therapy.","['Gabriele, L', 'Kaido, T', 'Woodrow, D', 'Moss, J', 'Ferrantini, M', 'Proletti, E', 'Santodonato, L', 'Rozera, C', 'Maury, C', 'Belardelli, F']","['Gabriele L', 'Kaido T', 'Woodrow D', 'Moss J', 'Ferrantini M', 'Proletti E', 'Santodonato L', 'Rozera C', 'Maury C', 'Belardelli F', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapy', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/genetics', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Aug;147(2):445-60.,,,,,,,PMC1869831,,,,,,,

Platelet vWF was significantly higher in CML patients in comparison to ET and normal controls. However, minor losses of the larger multimers were evident in all the subsets of patients. In ET patients also the intermediate forms were lacking in platelets, accompanied by a significant decrease of platelet RiCof. This abnormality was significantly correlated with the occurrence of bleeding symptoms in PV and ET patients (P = 0.007; Fisher's exact test). In conclusion, plasma and platelet vWF abnormalities are common findings in myeloproliferative syndromes and are more severe in ET. The more pronounced platelet vWF abnormalities in ET may reflect the more frequent bleeding symptoms observed in this disorder.","['Castaman, G', 'Lattuada, A', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Tosetto, A', 'Mannucci, P M', 'Rodeghiero, F']","['Castaman G', 'Lattuada A', 'Ruggeri M', 'Tosetto A', 'Mannucci PM', 'Rodeghiero F']","['Department of Hematology and Hemophilia, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (von Willebrand Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Thrombosis/metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/*analysis']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830490406 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 Aug;49(4):289-93. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830490406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports indicate that +12 is an acquired numerical cytogenetic abnormality, and may be associated with a worse prognosis or more extensive disease. Wright-Giemsa-stained blood or bone marrow smears obtained after initial diagnosis, and subsequent lymph node cells, bone marrow aspirate smears, or effusions were retrospectively studied from five patients whose disease underwent morphologic transformation from typical B-CLL to a high grade lymphoproliferative disease (Richter's syndrome). Using an alpha-satellite DNA probe to the centromere of chromosome 12, trisomy 12 was found in a proportion of cells from all five specimens with high grade lymphoproliferative disease, but in only one of five samples collected before transformation. These data suggest that +12 is an acquired cytogenetic abnormality in CLL and has a high frequency in Richter's syndrome.

Despite these advances, many patients still die from their disease. Most patients do not qualify for an allogeneic BMT either because of age or lack of an appropriate donor, and only a fraction of patients achieve a complete cytogenetic remission with IFN-A-based therapy. The timing of BMT and treatment sequences of IFN-A and BMT have been discussed. Prior treatment with IFN-A does not seem to affect transplant outcome; however, delaying transplantation has been reported to impact adversely on transplant results. Until controlled trials are performed, the issue of optimal timing of allogeneic BMT will remain controversial. The use of alternative donors may extend the option of allogeneic BMT to younger patients; however, for older patients this therapeutic modality still has an unacceptably high incidence of morbidity and mortality with current BMT regimens and other alternative treatments are needed. Investigational strategies searching for ways of improving the proportion of patients achieving complete cytogenetic remissions with IFN-A therapy need to be actively explored. These include new agents (eg, HHT) or new modalities such as intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation with in vitro purging. Investigators in the field must decide whether to continue randomized trials of IFN-A versus conventional chemotherapy, or to explore strategies that may enhance the effect of IFN-A-based therapy. Only when the durable cytogenetic response rates with IFN-A combinations increase to 40% or 50% will it be of value to proceed to phase III trials. Further understanding in the basic biology of CML and the effect of IFN-A in this disease will also provide clues to improving therapy with the goal of obtaining long-term disease control and cures in the majority of patients with the least burden of therapy.","['Giralt, S', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M']","['Giralt S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77031, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1995 Aug;22(4):396-404.,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,

Usually CGL is accompanied by the presence, in bone marrow cells, of the Ph chromosome, the first chromosomal anomaly to be regularly associated with a human neoplastic disease. CGL is predominantly a disease of the productive middle years of life, which maximizes its adverse impact on family life and family economics. The disease is of worldwide distribution and there is a slight male preponderance. The disease is characterized by an initial chronic phase when it behaves as a differentiated neoplasm and responds very well to simple, nonintensive therapy. After a variable interval, CGL undergoes metamorphosis to a refractory phase that responds poorly or sometimes not at all to therapy, even when this is intensive. At the stage of metamorphosis a great variety of clinical and hematologic pictures occur, and CGL may mimic a myeloproliferative disease, a myelodysplasia, a subacute leukemia, AML, or ALL. The old concept of an abrupt, explosive transition from the chronic phase to a so-called blastic crisis is incorrect: this rarely occurs and in most patients who are carefully followed, CGL is observed to undergo two or more stepwise evolutions, eg, from chronic phase to an accelerated myeloproliferative phase to a phase that resembles AML. Many patients with CGL conform to an established pattern of clinical features. There is a history of insidious symptoms of anemia and of splenomegaly. The physical signs are those of pallor and marked splenomegaly, while the hematologic findings are of moderate anemia, moderate thrombocytosis, and a marked granulocytic leukocytosis with a specific differential count. The radiologic findings are typically normal. Diagnostic difficulty seldom arises with this classic presentation. The patient who is detected at an early stage of CGL may lack the history, physical signs, and fully developed hematologic picture of CGL. Before the availability of cytogenetic studies, the diagnosis could only be established with confidence by observing the patient until the typical features of the disease emerged. Also considered are the less frequent but important atypical presentations of CGL. The symptoms and complaints, findings on examination, complications and hematologic findings may depart from the typical case in a bewildering variety of ways, so that the diagnosis may be difficult, indeed, CGL is generally not the initial diagnosis that is made. When the patient with CGL has received treatment, it is usual for he or she to become asymptomatic, with no abnormal physical signs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Spiers, A S']",['Spiers AS'],"['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, H.

Two populations of erythroid progenitors have been identified in the BM of patients with PV. One population responds normally to EPO and the other, the malignant clone, is exquisitely sensitive to EPO. The latter phenomenon is regarded as the most readily accepted explanation for the pathophysiology of this disease, although other mechanisms have been proposed. Thrombohemorrhagiccomplications, which usually correlate with the hematocrit level, are the most important because of their frequency and severity. Preventing such complications represents one of the most important therapeutic goals. Diagnostic criteria have been established enabling an accurate diagnosis of PV, in which the majority of patients live an excess of 10 years. Some will develop a falling hematocrit secondary to PPMM, also termed the spent phase. Patients may also develop acute leukemia, which is increased in incidence if myelosuppressive therapy is used, compared with phlebotomies alone. The initial treatment is phlebotomy to an hematocrit of 45% or less. The studies of the PVSG have shown that chlorambucil produces excessive mortality from malignancy, and 32P and phlebotomy are associated with superior survivals which are equivalent. Because of the substantial risk of thrombotic complications, elderly patients, ie, those older than 70 years, should be treated initially with phlebotomy and myelosuppressive therapy, usually 32P. Hydroxyurea appears less leukemogenic than 32P or alkylating agents; however, recent reports have questioned this.

The three small Maf family proteins (MafF, MafG, and MafK) that are closely related to the c-Maf protooncoprotein constitute half of the NF-E2 activity by forming heterodimers with the large tissue-restricted subunit of NF-E2 called p45. We have established and characterized murine erythroleukemia cells that conditionally overexpress MafK from a metallothionein promoter. The conditional expression of MafK caused accumulation of hemoglobin, an indication of terminal differentiation along the erythroid pathway. Concomitantly, DNA binding activities containing MafK were induced within the MafK-overexpressing cells.

The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown. We have identified a cDNA clone, DR-nm23, differentially expressed in a blast-crisis cDNA library, which has approximately 70% sequence similarity to the putative metastatic suppressor genes, nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. The deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the proteins encoded by these two latter genes is approximately 65% and includes domains and amino acid residues (the leucine zipper-like and the RGD domain, a serine and a histidine residue in the NH2- and in the COOH-terminal portion of the protein, respectively) postulated to be important for nm23 function. DR-nm23 mRNA is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified CD34+ cells. Its constitutive expression in the myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line, which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation, results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and causes apoptotic cell death. These results are consistent with a role for DR-nm23 in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest, a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Venturelli, D', 'Martinez, R', 'Melotti, P', 'Casella, I', 'Peschle, C', 'Cucco, C', 'Spampinato, G', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Calabretta, B']","['Venturelli D', 'Martinez R', 'Melotti P', 'Casella I', 'Peschle C', 'Cucco C', 'Spampinato G', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Calabretta B']","['Thomas Jefferson University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nme1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.16.7435 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Aug 1;92(16):7435-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.16.7435.,,,,['nm23'],['GENBANK/U29656'],,PMC41354,,,,,,,

In this report, we analyzed the nature of PML-RAR alpha-containing complexes in nuclear protein extracts of t(15;17)-positive cells. We show that endogenous PML-RAR alpha can bind to DNA as a homodimer, in contrast to RAR alpha that requires the retinoid X receptor (RXR) dimerization partner. In addition, these cells contain oligomeric complexes of PML-RAR alpha and endogenous RXR. Treatment with retinoic acid results in a decrease of PML-RAR alpha protein levels and, as a consequence, of DNA binding by the different complexes. Using responsive elements from various hormone signaling pathways, we show that PML-RAR alpha homodimers have altered DNA-binding characteristics when compared to RAR alpha-RXR alpha heterodimers. In transfected Drosophila SL-3 cells that are devoid of endogenous retinoid receptors PML-RAR alpha inhibits transactivation by RAR alpha-RXR alpha heterodimers in a dominant fashion. In addition, we show that both normal retinoid receptors and the PML-RAR alpha hybrid bind and activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor responsive element from the Acyl-CoA oxidase gene, indicating that retinoids and peroxisome proliferator receptors may share common target genes.

Here we show that the site of interaction with Tax is not the coiled coil, but the basic segment. This interaction increases the stability of the GCN4 bZIP dimer by 1.7 kcal mol-1 and the DNA affinity of the dimer by 1.9 kcal mol-1. The differential effect of Tax on several bZip-DNA complexes that differ in peptide sequence or DNA conformation suggests a model for Tax action based on stabilization of a distinct DNA-bound protein structure. This model may explain how Tax interacts with transcription factors of considerable sequence diversity to alter patterns of gene expression.","['Baranger, A M', 'Palmer, C R', 'Hamm, M K', 'Giebler, H A', 'Brauweiler, A', 'Nyborg, J K', 'Schepartz, A']","['Baranger AM', 'Palmer CR', 'Hamm MK', 'Giebler HA', 'Brauweiler A', 'Nyborg JK', 'Schepartz A']","['Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Probes', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",1995/08/17 00:00,1995/08/17 00:01,['1995/08/17 00:00'],"['1995/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/376606a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1995 Aug 17;376(6541):606-8. doi: 10.1038/376606a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Tax recognizes diverse bZIPs is not understood. Here we show that no specific sequence of the leucine zipper is required for a Tax response. In contrast, the basic region is essential for the Tax-mediated DNA-binding increase, which can be eliminated by single substitutions of several conserved amino acids. Surprisingly, Tax alters the relative affinity of a bZIP for different DNA binding sites. Thus, through recognition of the conserved basic region. Tax increases DNA binding and modifies DNA site selection. Tax provides a model for how a single auxiliary factor can regulate multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.","['Perini, G', 'Wagner, S', 'Green, M R']","['Perini G', 'Wagner S', 'Green MR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Leucine/metabolism', '*Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",1995/08/17 00:00,1995/08/17 00:01,['1995/08/17 00:00'],"['1995/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/376602a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1995 Aug 17;376(6541):602-5. doi: 10.1038/376602a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Torulopsis) glabrata) were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to 5-fluorocytosine, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and miconazole. The yeasts were isolated from clinical specimens, mostly from the lower respiratory tract, of 30 oncologic patients, 27/30 with haematological malignancies, during a 6-month period (December 1991-May 1992). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of the 6 drugs were obtained for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory. Amphotericin B, and 5-fluorocytosine were active against the majority of the yeasts with MIC90/MFC90 values within achievable serum concentrations (3.12/6.25 micrograms ml(-1) and 0.625/0.625 micrograms ml(-1) respectively). Azole derivatives showed a species-specific activity. MFC values were two to four times higher than those of the MICs, confirming the fungistatic rather than fungicidal activity of azole derivatives. An interesting correlation was found when the in vitro susceptibility values of the isolates were compared with data of patients with or without antifungal prophylaxis or therapy during that period. In general, with respect to fluconazole, C. albicans strains isolated from patients who received no treatment showed MIC and MFC values lower than those obtained from patients who were under prophylaxis or treatment with this drug. Fluconazole administration appears to influence in vitro susceptibility testing.","['Morace, G', 'Sanguinetti, M', 'Posteraro, B', 'Pagano, L']","['Morace G', 'Sanguinetti M', 'Posteraro B', 'Pagano L']","['Institute of Microbiology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Candida/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.1995.tb00009.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 1995 Jan-Feb;38(1-2):59-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.1995.tb00009.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of reports showing interleukin 2 receptor expression on AML blasts, it is important to know whether IL-2 may directly influence these leukemic cells. In initial studies using flow cytometry to analyze surface expression of interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R), we found expression of the IL-2R alpha chain on blast cells in 26% and of the IL-2R beta-chain in 81% of the patients. To confirm these results at the transcriptional level, we studied the expression of RNA of the IL-2R alpha, beta, and gamma chains by RT-PCR in the bone marrow of 38 newly diagnosed patients with AML and in three AML-derived cell lines. RNA of the alpha chain was detectable in 11/38 patients, the beta chain in 10/38 patients and the gamma chain in 30/38 patients with AML. Blast cells obtained from colonies growing in semisolid media expressed mRNA for IL-2R. RNA for all three IL-2R chains was expressed in lines KG1, HEL 92.1.7 and K562.

We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a DNA clone of WDSV, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the major proteins, and the start site for transcription. The long terminal repeat is 590 bp in length, with the U3 region containing consensus sequences likely to be involved in viral gene expression. A predicted histidyl-tRNA binding site is located 3 nucleotides distal to the 3' end of the long terminal repeat. Virus particles purified by isopycnic sedimentation followed by rate zonal sedimentation showed major polypeptides with molecular sizes of 90, 25, 20, 14, and 10 kDa. N-terminal sequencing of these allowed unambiguous assignment of the small polypeptides as products of the gag gene, including CA and NC, and the large polypeptide as the TM product of env. The 582-amino-acid (aa) Gag protein precursor is predicted to be myristylated as is found for most retroviruses. NC contains a single Cys-His motif like those found in all retroviruses except spumaviruses. The WDSV pro and pol genes are in the same translational reading frame as gag and thus apparently are translated after termination suppression. The env gene encodes a surface (SU) protein of 469 aa predicted to be highly glycosylated and a large transmembrane (TM) protein of 754 aa. The sequence of TM is unusual in that it ends in a very hydrophobic segment of 65 residues containing a single charged residue. Following the env gene are two nonoverlapping long open reading frames of 290 aa (orf-A) and 306 aa (orf-B), neither of which shows significant sequence similarity with known genes. A third open reading frame of 119 aa (orf-C) is located in the leader region preceding gag. The predicted amino acid sequence of reverse transcriptase would place WDSV phylogenetically closest to the murine leukemia virus-related genus of retroviruses.

Parental K562 cells showed no detectable P-glycoprotein expression, measured at the protein level (immunofluorescence labeling with monoclonal antibodies), and had very low levels of MDR-1 mRNA expression (RT-PCR analysis), when compared with levels measured in K562 VBL400. Differences in Pgp-mediated transport were estimated by comparing the rates of Fluo3 accumulation. The higher drug-transport function of K562 VBL400 cells (e.g., lower Fluo3 accumulation) correlated with their elevated levels of MDR-1. The rate of dye transport was sensitive to verapamil but was not affected by the tonicity of the extracellular medium. In contrast to the clear differences in transport function, the characteristics of chloride currents induced by cell swelling were indistinguishable between the two cell lines. Currents measured in the whole-cell configuration were outwardly rectifying, had a higher permeability to iodide than to chloride (SCN- > I- > Cl- > gluconate), were potently blocked by NPPB and were unresponsive to verapamil. The percentage of responding cells and the mean current density were nearly identical in both cell lines. In addition, activation of the volume-sensitive current was not prevented during whole-cell recordings obtained with pipettes containing high concentration of cytotoxic drugs (vincristine or vinblastine). These results do not lend support to the previously reported association between Pgp expression and volume-sensitive chloride channels, and suggest that a different protein is responsible for this type of chloride channel in K562 cells.","['Viana, F', 'Van Acker, K', 'De Greef, C', 'Eggermont, J', 'Raeymaekers, L', 'Droogmans, G', 'Nilius, B']","['Viana F', 'Van Acker K', 'De Greef C', 'Eggermont J', 'Raeymaekers L', 'Droogmans G', 'Nilius B']","['Laboratory of Physiology, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '23D4W0B50Y (Fluo-3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chloride Channels/*metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Xanthenes']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00233309 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1995 May;145(1):87-98. doi: 10.1007/BF00233309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six retinoid receptors belonging to two families are currently known: retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha,beta,and gamma) and retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha,beta,and gamma). Stilbene retinoid analogs of retinoic acid (RA), such as (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)prope n-1- yl]benzoic acid (TTNPB, 1) and (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl)pro pen-1- yl]benzoic acid (3-methyl-TTNPB, 2), display differential RAR and RXR activities, depending on the substituent at C3 of the naphthalene ring. We report here structural modifications of the benzoate moiety of 2 that result in analogs with greater RXR selectivity as well as those with pan-agonist (activate both RAR and RXR receptors) activities, analyze the structural features that impart receptor selectivity, and describe a stereoselective method for the synthesis of these analogs. The biological activities associated with the RAR and RXR receptors were examined by testing representative examples with different receptor activation profiles for their ability to induce tissue transglutaminase (Tgase) activity in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60 cdm-1) and to inhibit tumor-promoter-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in hairless mouse skin. These results suggest that RAR agonists and RXR agonists may have different therapeutic applications.

This provided the rationale to conduct a phase II trial of a somatostatin analog in patients with B- and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with measurable or assessable lymphoproliferative disorders (31 stage III or IV low-grade NHL; 21 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]; and nine cutaneous T-cell NHL [CTCL]) were enrolled. Patients were treated with somatostatin 150 micrograms subcutaneously (SQ) every 8 hours for 1 month. Patients with stable or responding disease received 2 additional months of therapy; those who responded after 3 months were treated for an additional > or = 3 months. RESULTS: Sixty patients were assessable for toxicity and 56 for response. There were no complete remissions. In the low-grade NHL group, 36% (10 of 28 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 19% to 56%) had a partial remission. Forty-four percent (four of nine; 95% CI, 14% to 79%) of patients with CTCL had a partial response. No patients with CLL had a partial remission. Among 45 patients with stable disease or a partial remission, the mean time to progression (TTP) was 10.9 months (median, 6.2; range, 1.6 to 48.5).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were more than 15 years of age and had received only one prior course of MOPP and were in relapse with measurable disease. The EVA regimen (etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on days 1, 2, and 3; vinblastine 6 mg/m2 IV on day 1; and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1) was administered every 28 days for a minimum of four and a maximum of six cycles.

There were 40% complete responses (CRs) and 33% partial responses (PRs). The median follow-up time in 42 months. The median time to treatment failure (TTF) is 10 months, with 31% continuing progression-free. Eighteen patients achieved a second CR, with only seven recurrences in that group. Failure-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in patients whose first MOPP-induced remission was longer than 12 months and who were free of B symptoms at relapse. Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression, which resulted in two toxic deaths. Pulmonary toxicity was not observed.

Both regimens contained IV cisplatin. The objectives were to compare survival (primary end point) and to establish response rates, failure-free survival, and toxicity (secondary end points). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with untreated measurable or assessable disease and normal organ function were eligible. Randomization was stratified according to performance status 0 versus 1 or 2. Treatment consisted of etoposide 130 mg/m2/d IV for 3 days and cisplatin 25 mg/m2/d IV for 3 days every 21 days for eight courses (schedule 1) versus etoposide 50 mg/m2/d orally for 21 days and cisplatin 33 mg/m2/d IV for 3 days every 28 days for six courses (schedule 2). In 1990, bioavailability of oral etoposide was assumed to be 50%, and the study was designed to deliver the same total doses of etoposide and cisplatin on both regimens over 24 weeks without the use of growth factors. RESULTS: Between December 1990 and October 1993, 306 eligible patients were entered. Of these, 69% were male and 66% were > or = 60 years of age; 21% had a performance status of 0, 47% a performance status of 1, and 32% a performance status of 2; 156 were randomized to receive schedule 1 and 150 to receive schedule 2. Overall median survival estimates were 9.5 and 9.9 months (difference not significant) for schedule 1 and schedule 2, respectively. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival, 8 to 11 months, was the same for both schedules, with 126 and 117 deaths on schedule 1 and 2, respectively. Both schedules also resulted in the same median failure-free survival estimate of 7 months (95% CI, 6 to 8 months on either schedule). Complete and partial responses were observed in 15% and 42% of patients on schedule 1 and 14% and 47% on schedule 2, respectively. The overall maximal hematologic toxicities grade 3 and 4 for leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and hemoglobin were, respectively, as follows: schedule 1, 62%, 85%, 32%, and 32%; schedule 2, 83%, 83%, 52%, and 53%. Lethal toxicity due to neutropenia and infection occurred in 4% of patients on schedule 1 and 10% on schedule 2 (difference not statistically significant).

The p12I protein is associated with cellular endomembranes, and physically binds to the 16 kDa subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase proton pump. To investigate the nature of the 16 kDa and p12I interaction and to determine the oncogenic domain of p12I, we constructed p12I mutant proteins in which various portions of the TM domains were deleted, as well as p12I mutant containing a single amino acid substitution. These mutants were tested for binding to the 16 kDa subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase in HeLa/Tat cells and for the capability to potentiate transformation by bovine papillomavirus type 1 E5 oncoprotein in mouse C127 cells. The results indicated that both TM domains of the p12I protein were dispensable for its interaction with the 16 kDa protein, whereas partial or complete deletion of the proline-rich region resulted in decreased or no binding of the p12I protein to the 16 kDa subunit. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa/Tat cells transfected with the p12I mutants showed that deletion of the proline-rich region did not alter the subcellular localization of these mutant p12I proteins, suggesting direct involvement of the proline-rich domain in binding rather than the failure of these p12I mutants to reach the appropriate cellular compartment. Mapping of 16 kDa subunit mutants in binding with p12I protein suggested that molecular determinants located between the second and third TM domain of the 16 kDa protein might be involved in this interaction. Finally, most of the p12I mutants lost the ability to potentiate transformation of C127 cells indicating that binding of p12I to the 16 kDa subunit does not directly correlate with oncogenicity.","['Koralnik, I J', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Andresson, T', 'Fullen, J', 'Franchini, G']","['Koralnik IJ', 'Mulloy JC', 'Andresson T', 'Fullen J', 'Franchini G']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institue, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (oncogene protein E5, Bovine papillomavirus type 1)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Vacuoles/enzymology', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-76-8-1909 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1995 Aug;76 ( Pt 8):1909-16. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-76-8-1909.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that autoantibodies were elevated during the initiation phases of this murine retrovirus infection and bound peptide determinants corresponding to CDR1 of several TCR V beta-chains. Therefore, we designed studies to determine whether administration of a major autoimmunogenic TCR V beta CDR1 peptide before or after infection with LP-BM5 retrovirus would modulate retrovirus-induced dysregulation of T cell function. Administration of the TCR V beta CDR1 peptide before murine retrovirus infection significantly prevented its suppression of splenic NK cell activity, T and B cell proliferation, and monokine (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and Th1 cytokine (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) release by splenocytes, and inhibited retrovirus-induced elevation of Th2 cytokine (IL-5 and IL-10). Similar data were obtained with peptide immunization 2 wk after murine retrovirus infection at 6 and 16 wk postinfection. However, delaying peptide immunization until severe suppression of T and B cell mitogenesis had occurred did not restore their functions. Immunization with TCR V beta peptide prevents development of retrovirus-induced immune dysfunction, which suggests a possible pathogenic role of autoreactive T cells as regulatory elements.","['Watson, R R', 'Wang, J Y', 'Dehghanpisheh, K', 'Huang, D S', 'Wood, S', 'Ardestani, S K', 'Liang, B', 'Marchalonis, J J']","['Watson RR', 'Wang JY', 'Dehghanpisheh K', 'Huang DS', 'Wood S', 'Ardestani SK', 'Liang B', 'Marchalonis JJ']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Aug 15;155(4):2282-91.,,,"['AA-08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

At sublytic concentrations, these proteins trigger several cellular activities, including protein phosphorylation and synthesis. We have recently demonstrated that human leukemic cells treated with sublytic doses of human complement become more resistant to lytic complement doses. The study has now been extended to include three other pore-formers: murine perforin, SLO and melittin. As shown here, sublytic MAC induces in the K562 human erythroleukemic cells protection from lytic perforin, and vice versa, sublytic perforin induces protection from complement. Also, sublytic SLO and melittin increase resistance of K562 cells to lytic complement and perforin doses. The capacity of Ca2+ ionophores to induce resistance to the lytic proteins has been examined. Exposure of K562 cells to sublytic concentrations of ionomycin or A23187 for 1 h at 37 degrees C confers on them resistance to complement- and perforin-mediated lysis. The protective effects of the ionophores can be abrogated by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ and by inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis in the cells. These results indicate the following: 1) nucleated cells exposed to sublytic complement MAC, perforin, SLO, or melittin may become resistant to the four pore-formers. Physiologically, this may be regarded as an immunologic tachyphylaxis. 2) Ca2+ influx induced by these pore-formers is an essential and sufficient factor to produce this tachyphylaxis.","['Reiter, Y', 'Ciobotariu, A', 'Jones, J', 'Morgan, B P', 'Fishelson, Z']","['Reiter Y', 'Ciobotariu A', 'Jones J', 'Morgan BP', 'Fishelson Z']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex/*physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Streptolysins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Aug 15;155(4):2203-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-07e cells express GM-CSFR and are dependent on GM-CSF for survival and proliferation in vitro. Treatment with anti-lyn Abs coimmunoprecipitated, along with lyn product, the beta subunit of GM-CSFR and a phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 120 kDa (p120) in the lysates of M-07e cells but not in the lysates of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) or human lymphoid leukemia cells. That the 120-kDa phosphoprotein coimmunoprecipitated by anti-lyn Abs is the beta subunit of GM-CSFR was confirmed in the immunoprecipitates (IP) of M-07e cells with the use of an agarose-conjugated anti-p-tyr mAb. The formation of GM-CSF/GM-CSFR/lyn signaling complexes was verified in an autoradiographic study with anti-lyn IP of M-07e cells that had been bound with 125I-labeled recombinant human (rh)GM-CSF. The p120 protein (beta subunit) was not detected in the IP of M-07e cells with anti-fyn or anti-PI3 Abs. A direct association of Lyn kinase with the beta subunit of GM-CSFR was illustrated with a reversed approach showing the recovery of Lyn protein in anti-beta (CRS1) but not anti-alpha IP of M-07e cells that had been starved for a prolonged period. Finally, the interaction of Lyn kinase with the GM-CSFR complexes was further corroborated using anti-GM-CSF (G133) mAb, which coimmunoprecipitated both the p120 beta subunit and lyn product in the lysates of M-07e cells that had been bound with rhGM-CSF before cell lysis. Removal of rhGM-CSF from culture medium for 10 to 12 h resulted in a marked decrease in lyn-associated kinase activity but not the beta subunit/lyn kinase complex formation. Taken together, our results showed that, in M-07e cells, Lyn protein tyrosine kinase (p53/p56lyn) is stably associated with a constitutively phosphorylated beta subunit of the GM-CSFR in a manner that seems to be independent of lyn kinase activity.","['Li, Y', 'Shen, B F', 'Karanes, C', 'Sensenbrenner, L', 'Chen, B']","['Li Y', 'Shen BF', 'Karanes C', 'Sensenbrenner L', 'Chen B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Autoradiography', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', '*src-Family Kinases']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Aug 15;155(4):2165-74.,,,"['AI 23499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47424/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

FJ was purified to homogeneity from human urine by sequential chromatographic steps. To examine the expression of FJ in human cells we obtained mAbs against urine-purified FJ. Preliminary studies by immunocytochemistry revealed that one of the anti-FJ mAbs recognized cell surface components of certain cell lines, such as K562 and U937 cells, so we have focused subsequently on the detection of these homologue membrane-bound FJ Ags (FJ-h Ags) in cell lines of lymphoid (Ramos and Jurkat) and mieloyd (U937 and K562) origin, as well as in peripheral blood cells. The flow cytometry analysis of the examined cell lines revealed partial staining ranging from 10% (U937) to 29% (K562) positive cells. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells showed a positive staining in a small but consistent population of lymphocytes (mean = 11%, n = 17) but none at all on monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets. Double Ab immunostaining of lymphocytes showed that the FJ-h positive population included mainly B lymphocytes (a mean of 63% CD19+ were FJ-h positive). When we analyzed peripheral blood lymphocytes from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia B (95% CD19+/CD5+), the majority of these (55%) bore FJ-h on their surface. Acid strip of these cells did not abrogate the surface staining, which supports the finding that the Ag is tightly bound to the membrane. Immunoprecipitation from U937 cell lysates showed a single 65 kDa band under reducing conditions. FJ-h Ags purified from K562 and U937 cells displayed inhibitory activity in the functional EAC14 assay for the classical complement pathway, as did urine FJ, and they were recognized immunochemically by five different (one polyclonal and four monoclonal) anti-FJ Abs. In conclusion, FJ-homologues are present in the membranes of several human cell lines that show functional and antigenic characteristics similar to soluble urine FJ. They are also found in a small subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes, mainly B cells.

Serum levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 were also elevated. Interestingly, these mice produced Ab against IgG, type II collagen (IIC), and heat shock proteins accompanied by IgG hypergammaglobulinemia. The cellular immune response to IIC as well as that to heat shock proteins were activated. Moreover, these mice became immunologically responsive to exogenously administered IIC and developed arthritis, in contrast to their nontransgenic littermates, which showed little response to IIC. Taken together, the results suggest that human T cell leukemia virus type 1 can cause immune system hyperreactivity and induce autoimmunity. The possibility that elevated cytokine and/or MHC gene expression are involved in the development of autoimmunity and arthropathy are discussed.","['Iwakura, Y', 'Saijo, S', 'Kioka, Y', 'Nakayama-Yamada, J', 'Itagaki, K', 'Tosu, M', 'Asano, M', 'Kanai, Y', 'Kakimoto, K']","['Iwakura Y', 'Saijo S', 'Kioka Y', 'Nakayama-Yamada J', 'Itagaki K', 'Tosu M', 'Asano M', 'Kanai Y', 'Kakimoto K']","['Laboratory Animal Research Center, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (I-E-antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Collagen/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, pX', 'H-2 Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/immunology/*virology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Aug 1;155(3):1588-98.,,,,"['env', 'pX']",,,,,,,,,,

The gene contains a proximal functional promoter region (-620 to +34), as well as a powerful enhancer located 3 kb upstream, both of which are involved in the response of the gene to TCR activation. The proximal promoter contains a region termed CLEO (-54 to -31) that consists of a purine-rich element abutting an activator protein-1 (AP-1)-like site, as well as an upstream nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) site (-85 to -76) and a CK-1 element (-101 to -92). We show in this work that mutations in either the purine-rich region of the CLEO element or the NF-kappa B site result in reduced PMA/Ca2+ activation of a 620-bp human GM-CSF promoter-luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat T cells by 65% and 50%, respectively. The major inducible protein complex that binds to the human CLEO (hCLEO) element is an AP-1-like complex that is inducible by PMA alone, but shows increased binding in response to PMA together with Ca2+ ionophore. Although the binding of this complex is not cyclosporin-sensitive, promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment. A second weak inducible complex resembling nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) was also observed binding to the hCLEO region. By using recombinant proteins, we confirmed that AP-1, NF-ATp, and a higher order NF-ATp/AP-1 complex could all form with the hCLEO element, and we have also defined the sequence requirements for binding of each of these complexes. We found that expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin could substitute for Ca2+ ionophore and synergize with PMA to activate the GM-CSF promoter, and conversely that mutant-activated Ras could substitute for PMA and cooperate with Ca2+ ionophore. Co-expression of Ras and calcineurin, however, did not activate the GM-CSF promoter, but required the additional expression of NF-kappa B p65. These results imply that at least three signals are required to activate the GM-CSF proximal promoter, and that the signals impinge on distinct transcription factors that bind to the hCLEO and NF-kappa B regions of the promoter.","['Jenkins, F', 'Cockerill, P N', 'Bohmann, D', 'Shannon, M F']","['Jenkins F', 'Cockerill PN', 'Bohmann D', 'Shannon MF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcineurin', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Aug 1;155(3):1240-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific lysis by CD8+ CTL clones was observed not only of the leukemic-HPC but also of the donor-HPC in 3/4 patient/donor combinations expressing mH antigen HA-1, 3/5 combinations expressing mH antigen HA-2, 2/3 combinations expressing mH antigen HA-3, and 2/2 combinations expressing mH antigen HY-A1. In four patient/donor combinations the recognition of the donor-HPC was clearly less than of the leukemic-HPC, indicating differential susceptibility to lysis by these mH CTL clones. In addition, differential recognition of leukemic-HPC and remission-HPC within seven patients was analyzed. In one patient expressing the HA-2 antigen on the leukemic cells the recognition of the remission-HPC was clearly less than of the leukemic-HPC. One CD4+ CTL clone showed specific lysis of the leukemic-HPC from an AML patient and a CML patient as well as of normal remission-HPC and donor-HPC. These results illustrate that in general CD8+ and CD4+ mH antigen specific CTL clones do not differentially recognize leukemic-HPC and normal-HPC. However, differences in susceptibility to lysis of malignant versus normal cells may contribute to a differential GVL effect.","['Faber, L M', 'van der Hoeven, J', 'Goulmy, E', 'Hooftman-den Otter, A L', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Faber LM', 'van der Hoeven J', 'Goulmy E', 'Hooftman-den Otter AL', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118134 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Aug;96(2):877-83. doi: 10.1172/JCI118134.,,,,,,,PMC185274,,,,,,,

METHOD: Cancer incidence through 31 December 1987 was ascertained in a cohort of 1132 individuals employed at the worksite at any time from 1 July 1974 through 30 September 1980, the period of potential exposure to ETO at the plant. The number of observed cancers was compared with that expected based on age- and sex-specific incidence rates reported by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated separately for regular and temporary employees. RESULTS: Of the 28 cancers observed in the cohort, 12 were breast cancers. The SMR for breast cancer among regular female employees ranged from 2.55 (95% CI: 1.31-4.98, P = 0.02) to 1.70 (95% CI: 0.89-3.23, P = 0.09) depending on calendar year of follow-up, assumptions about completeness of follow-up, and the reference rates used. The excess of breast cancer over expected in regular female employees diminished over time. No statistically significant excess of breast cancer was noted for temporary female employees at any point during follow-up. No increase in cancer incidence was found over that expected for any cancer sites associated with ETO in previous studies--leukaemia, brain, pancreas and stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as appropriateness of latency periods, length of follow-up and lack of a common histopathological type need to be considered in evaluating the excesses in observed breast cancer incidence, which diminished over time.","['Norman, S A', 'Berlin, J A', 'Soper, K A', 'Middendorf, B F', 'Stolley, P D']","['Norman SA', 'Berlin JA', 'Soper KA', 'Middendorf BF', 'Stolley PD']","['Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Employment', 'Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Reference Values', 'SEER Program', 'Time Factors']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/24.2.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1995 Apr;24(2):276-84. doi: 10.1093/ije/24.2.276.,,['Int J Epidemiol. 1996 Jun;25(3):685-6.

The factor was recently shown to possess an amino acid sequence identical to that reported for one of the HMG1 proteins, designated as 'amphoterin' on the basis of its highly dipolar sequence. In the present study, we have expressed DEF cDNA in an E. coli strain and found that the recombinant protein has functional properties identical to those observed with native DEF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, following MEL cell stimulation with the chemical inducer, DEF is secreted in large amounts in the extracellular medium. In fact, the N-terminal sequence and the partial amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from the secreted protein correspond to those of DEF isolated from the soluble fraction of resting MEL cells. These results are indicative for an extracellular localization as the site of action of DEF and suggest a novel function for proteins belonging to the HMG1 family. Finally, the early decay of DEF mRNA, in chemical induced MEL cells, support the hypothesis that the involvement of the enhancing factor occurs and is completed in the early phases of cell differentiation.","['Melloni, E', 'Sparatore, B', 'Patrone, M', 'Pessino, A', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Pontremoli, S']","['Melloni E', 'Sparatore B', 'Patrone M', 'Pessino A', 'Passalacqua M', 'Pontremoli S']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Erythropoiesis', '*HMGB1 Protein', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/24 00:00,1995/07/24 00:01,['1995/07/24 00:00'],"['1995/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(95)00716-M [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)00716-m [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1995 Jul 24;368(3):466-70. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(95)00716-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common denominator in the pathogenesis of graft-vs.-host disease, graft rejection, reactional lepromatous leprosy, and autoimmune disorders modulated by thalidomide is the activation of T lymphocytes culminating in the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptors, and the induction of proliferation. We investigated the effect of thalidomide on the production of IL-2 by the human leukemia cell line Jurkat through induction of IL-2 gene enhancer activity and through the presence of IL-2 in supernatants. beta-galactosidase activity, encoded by a reporter lac z construct and controlled by a transcription factor in thalidomide-treated PMA- and ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat cells, was similar (97 +/- 1.33%; p > 0.1) to non-thalidomide-treated controls at all drug concentrations tested. IL-2 enhancer-driven beta-galactose activity of thalidomide-treated and stimulated cells was also similar to that of untreated controls (p > 0.2). The IL-2 production of activated nontransfected Jurkat cells was gauged by using the IL-2-dependent cell line HT-2 as a readout and by ELISA. Jurkat cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. Bulk cultures and three subclones (J.5.2.5., J.5.2.9., and J.5.3.8.) were assayed at 6, 12, and 24 hours after PHA/PMA-induced stimulation. No inhibitory effect on the IL-2 production by thalidomide could be detected at any of the drug concentrations tested (5-30 micrograms/mL), whereas 10 to 100 ng/mL of cyclosporine inhibited the IL-2 production by 95 to 100%. In addition, we observed neither inhibition of IL-2-dependent proliferation of HT-2 nor inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation of peripheral mononuclear cells by thalidomide at all drug concentrations used (5-30 micrograms/mL). These results do not support the possibility of a modulatory effect on the immune response by thalidomide via IL-2 production and IL-2 response.","['Fernandez, L P', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Baker, J', 'Chen, Y', 'Chao, N J']","['Fernandez LP', 'Schlegel PG', 'Baker J', 'Chen Y', 'Chao NJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/biosynthesis']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Aug;23(9):978-85.,,,,,,,,,,,['Exp Hematol 1995 Nov;23(12):1324'],,,

Patients with ALL and seizures were identified retrospectively by review of the records of all pediatric ALL patients who were diagnosed and treated during the years 1983 through March 1993 in a large tertiary-care hospital. Seventeen patients (13%) developed one or more seizures. In 16 patients, seizures occurred during antileukemic treatment, and in almost all of them seizures were related to intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) or subcutaneous L-asparaginase treatment. One patient who developed a seizure while not receiving chemotherapy had a history of cerebral infarctions. In 8 patients, (47%), the initial seizure episode was associated with a cerebral lesion. One or more seizures recurred in 6 patients. Four of these patients had an isolated recurrence, in 3 patients < or = 3 months and in 1 patient < or = 6 months after the initial event. Two patients (12%) with static encephalopathy and neurological deficits developed a chronic seizure disorder. There is a significant risk of acute symptomatic seizures in pediatric ALL patients. Most seizures in these patients occur during the acute treatment phase and are most frequently related to side effects of chemotherapy. The long-term recurrence risk is low; recurrence occurs most often in patients with evidence of cerebral structural lesions and neurological deficits. Long-term antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy should be restricted to such patients.","['Maytal, J', 'Grossman, R', 'Yusuf, F H', 'Shende, A C', 'Karayalycin, G', 'Lanzkowsky, P', 'Schaul, N', 'Eviatar, L']","['Maytal J', 'Grossman R', 'Yusuf FH', 'Shende AC', 'Karayalycin G', 'Lanzkowsky P', 'Schaul N', 'Eviatar L']","[""Division of Pediatric Neurology, Schneider Children's Hospital, New Hyde Park, NY 11042, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Epilepsia,Epilepsia,2983306R,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Epilepsy/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seizures/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1528-1157.1995.tb01622.x [doi]'],ppublish,Epilepsia. 1995 Aug;36(8):831-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1995.tb01622.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine their source, primary cultures of oligodendroblasts immunopurified from postnatal rat cerebrum were used to screen other cultured neural and non-neural cell types for the release of survival factors into a defined insulin-containing medium. In non-conditioned medium, oligodendroblasts died 1-2 days after undergoing terminal differentiation into oligodendrocytes, as defined by the onset of expression of galactocerebroside. In medium conditioned by astrocytes, unlike the other tested cell types, differentiated oligodendrocytes survived for weeks in a mature myelinogenic state. Survival was partially reduced by immunoabsorption of the medium with antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor and abolished by immunoabsorption with antibodies to leukemia inhibitory factor. By the same criterion, survival activity was not attributed to other astrocytic products, ciliary neurotrophic factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Membrane ultrafiltration analysis indicated the activity corresponded to heat-labile protein smaller (M(r) = 10(-30) x 10(3)) than native rat leukemia inhibitory factor (M(r) = 43 x 10(3)). The astrocytic stimulus was > 4-fold more efficacious than other known oligodendrogliotrophic cytokines, including ciliary neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 and leukemia inhibitory factor itself, tested singly or in combination, and promoted survival additively with these agents. These findings suggest that astrocytes function as paracrine regulators of oligodendroblast and oligodendrocyte survival and that their effect is mediated initially by platelet-derived growth factor and thereafter by a powerful cytokine related to leukemia inhibitory factor.","['Gard, A L', 'Burrell, M R', 'Pfeiffer, S E', 'Rudge, J S', 'Williams, W C 2nd']","['Gard AL', 'Burrell MR', 'Pfeiffer SE', 'Rudge JS', 'Williams WC 2nd']","['Department of Structural and Cellular Biology, College of Medicine, University of South Alabama, Mobile 36688, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oligodendroglia/*cytology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Rats']",1995/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1995 Jul;121(7):2187-97.,,,['NS29648/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the development of parthenote embryos by using an inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowth assay that mimics peri-implantation development. ICMs from normal embryos maintained undifferentiated stem cells positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and Rex-1 while differentiating into a variety of cell types, including visceral endoderm-like cells and parietal endoderm cells. In contrast, ICMs from parthenotes failed to maintain undifferentiated stem cells and differentiated almost exclusively into parietal endoderm. This suggests that parthenote ICMs have a defect that leads to differentiation, rather than maintenance, of the stem cells, and a defect that leads to a parietal endoderm fate for the stem cells. To test the hypothesis that the ICM population is not maintained owing to a lack of proliferation of the stem cells, we investigated whether mitogenic agents were able to maintain the ICM population in parthenotes. When parthenote blastocysts were supplied with the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (Igf-1r) and insulin-like growth factor-2 (Igf-2), two genes not detectable in parthenote blastocysts by in situ hybridization, the ICM population was maintained. Similarly, culture of parthenote blastocysts in medium conditioned by embryonic fibroblasts and supplemented with the maternal factor leukemia inhibitory factor maintained the ICM population.

It is clear that Bcl-2 plays a critical role in controlling many forms of PCD. Bcl-2 seems to have particular significance in lymphocyte development and the function of the immune system. We have also discussed the increasing size of the newly identified Bcl-2 family. There are a number of Bcl-2 homologues in human, murine, avian, nematode, and viral systems. The evolutionary conservation of the function of the Bcl-2 homologues, reinforces the importance of PCD in all complex organisms. Some of these bcl-2-like genes function as agonists and others as antagonists. Despite the seemingly universal importance of Bcl-2, it is unable to prevent PCD in all systems. In addition, we have described a role for other Bcl-2 family members in systems in which Bcl-2 is ineffective and supplied a potential rationale for the large number of genes involved in the regulation of PCD. Identification and functional analysis of the Bcl-2 family members reveals the complex nature of cell death regulation. As we begin to appreciate the significance of PCD in the control of development and homeostasis, its regulation at the molecular level is becoming better understood. Bcl-2 has long been the only known intracellular regulator of the PCD pathway(s), although its ability to prevent apoptosis is not universal. We now know that bcl-2 is only one member of an evolutionary conserved family of genes which display different patterns of expression as well as function. At least two family members, Bcl-xs and Bax, act in opposition to Bcl-2. The discovery of these new family members, including those with Bcl-2-like function and antagonists, should help clear up the discrepancies seen in Bcl-2's ability to protect cells from PCD. In doing so, we will be able to further define the pathways associated with cell death signaling. The study of these family members, as well as the non-related genes of the PCD pathways (ced-3, ced-4, ice) should lead us to understanding of how cells of multicellular organisms make decisions to die.","['Boise, L H', 'Gottschalk, A R', 'Quintans, J', 'Thompson, C B']","['Boise LH', 'Gottschalk AR', 'Quintans J', 'Thompson CB']","['Gwen Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-79437-7_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1995;200:107-21. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-79437-7_8.,,,,"['MCL1/A1', 'bax', 'bcl-2', 'bcl-x']",,86,,,,,,,,

In this situation cytotoxic chemotherapy alone is insufficient and additional plasma therapy is required. Until recently, conventional plasma exchange was the only plasma therapy available.

Cascade filtration, on the other hand, has been established to remove proteins as a function of their size offering the prospect of a highly selective withdrawal of macromolecules. In the work presented, the efficacy of conventional plasma exchange and cascade filtration was evaluated performing both techniques at random in cases of hyperviscosity syndrome due to immunocytoma of Waldenstrom's type (n = 11/group). In these patients, conventional plasma exchange decreased plasma viscosity by 48%; cascade filtration was less effective (26%), correlating with a smaller decrease of IgM (conventional plasma exchange 42% vs cascade filtration 27%).

Antibody Amp4/42 did not bind to alkali-treated control DNA or to DNA that had been alkylated with melphalan but not exposed to alkali. In a competitive enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay using DNA that had been reacted with radioactive melphalan in simple solution a 50% reduction in assay signal was caused by approximately 100 fmol total melphalan-DNA adducts/assay well. This sensitivity was only slightly influenced by heat denaturation of the DNA before alkylation or by the frequency of alkylated sites on DNA. The heat stability of the adducts recognized by Amp4/42 was greatly increased by the alkali-induced change which, in 0.1 M NaOH at 37 degrees C, was complete by 30 min. Amp4/42 appears to recognize a ring-opened structure resulting from alkaline hydrolysis of 7-alkyldeoxyguanosine. Melphalan-DNA adducts formed in mammalian cells showed an alkali-induced increase in immunoreactivity which occurred at a similar rate to that seen in DNA that had been alkylated in simple solution, but their maximum overall immunoreactivity was approximately 10-fold lower.

A temperature-sensitive mutant of murine p53 (p53Val-135) and/or bcl-2 was transfected into murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL, DP16-1, which are null in p53). We demonstrate that radiation-induced cell death occurs by both p53-dependent and -independent pathways and overexpression of bcl-2 modulates both pathways. When viability was measured 24 h post-radiation, cells that had been briefly exposed to wtp53 immediately after X-ray irradiation had decreased survival as compared to unirradiated cells expressing wtp53 or X-ray irradiated DP16-1 cells. However, at later times X-ray irradiated parental DP16-1 cells also had decreased survival compared to the unirradiated control. This decrease in survival began 48 h following radiation. Bcl-2 prevented radiation-induced cell death in DP16-1 cells expressing wtp53 and delayed radiation-induced cell death in DP16-1 cells without wtp53. X-ray irradiated cells expressing wtp53 displayed microscopic and biochemical characteristics consistent with cell death due to apoptosis. DP16-1 cells which were untransfected or co-transfected with wtp53 and bcl-2 displayed characteristics of cells undergoing necrosis. These results suggest that radiation-induced cell death occurs by both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. The p53-dependent pathway results in cell death via apoptosis and occurs approximately 24 h following radiation. The p53-independent pathway does not appear to involve apoptosis and occurs at a later time, starting 48 h after X-ray exposure.

It enhances tubulin-monomer polymerization and stabilizes tubulin polymers, increasing the fraction of cells in the G2 or M phase of the cell cycle. We report that treatment of HL-60 and U937 myeloid cell lines with 1-10 microM taxol induces DNA fragmentation and the appearance of morphological features consistent with the process of apoptosis. Taxol-induced apoptosis is inhibited neither by cycloheximide nor by actinomycin D and therefore appears to be independent of new protein synthesis. Taxol causes arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and affects cell viability but does not induce DNA fragmentation in the K562 erythromyeloid cell line. Protein-synthesis inhibitors, colcemid, ionomycin, and starvation, known to trigger apoptosis, proved ineffective as well.

Transfection of a retroviral vector DNA into these cocultures results in massive virus production, with potentially endless cross-infection between different types of packaging cells. Because the helper-free virus spreads efficiently throughout the coculture, it is unnecessary to use dominant selectable marker genes, and the retroviral vectors can be simplified and optimized for expressing a single gene of interest. The most efficient ping-pong vector, pSFF, derived from the Friend erythroleukemia virus, has been used for high-level expression of several genes that could not be expressed with commonly employed two-gene retroviral vectors. Contrary to previous claims, problems of vector recombination are not inherent to ping-pong methods. Indeed, the pSFF vector has not formed replication-competent recombinants as shown by stringent assays. Here we review these methods, characterize the ping-pong process using the human erythropoietin gene as a model, and describe a new vector (pSFY) designed for enhanced expression in T lymphocytes.

The functional immune responses of the patients were assessed as natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytotoxic activities and in vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) synthesis. During rIL-2 treatment, the expected side effects occurred; only 3 patients, who showed severe cardiovascular toxicity, required suspension of the treatment. All toxicities reversed after the end of the therapy. Immunologic monitoring was carried out the day before starting rIL-2 infusion and then repeated on days 3, 7, and 14 after rIL-2 was discontinued. Following every rIL-2 course, a pronounced increase in CD3+, CD8+, CD56+ cells was found, with a peak value on day 3. The NK and LAK activities showed a significant increase on day 3 (p < 0.001) over pretherapy values; the increase lasted until day 14, although the difference at later time points was not significant.

Unfortunately, poor countries cannot afford these drugs as they are costly and scarce. We undertook this study in Bombay to help us make rational choices in this area. METHODS: We studied the mortality, incidence and years of potential life lost by premature death from specific cancers in children under 15 years of age. RESULTS: Leukaemia accounted for 30% to 50% of premature life lost by death from cancers regardless of gender or age, i.e. if such loss was avoided by timely diagnosis and therapy, up to 50% gain of person-life would occur. It constituted nearly one-third of the childhood cancers, with age-adjusted rates comparable with American blacks and whites in boys, but less in girls. Incidence and decline of mortality due to leukaemia from 1964 was lower in girls than in boys. CONCLUSIONS: A focus on leukaemia treatment would increase productive person-life by nearly 50%. A triaging system might be the best method for allocating treatment till data on cost of such therapy are available. There is a need to increase morphological diagnoses in girls. Concentrating on treating girls with leukaemia older than 5 might contribute most in terms of gain in human potential and would be a cost-effective use of scarce resources.","['Krishnamurthy, S']",['Krishnamurthy S'],"['Department of Community Oncology, Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Care Rationing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Population Surveillance', 'Urban Health', '*Value of Life']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 1995 Jul-Aug;8(4):161-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety patients (43%) received marrow matched serologically at HLA A, B, and DR loci; 86 (41%) received marrow with a major and 32 (15%) marrow with a minor serologic mismatch at the HLA A or B locus. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age had an adverse effect on survival. In younger (age less than 18 years) recipients, survival after fully matched (A, B, and DR sub-type) or major mismatched (A or B locus), DR subtype-matched donor BMT was not significantly different (P = .4; survival: 53% v 41%, respectively, at 3 years). For adults, survival after matched donor BMT was significantly better than that with mismatched donors (P < .01; survival: 30% v 10%, respectively, at 3 years). Formal quality of life assessment by telephone interview demonstrated similar functional status in survivors of URD and related donor (RD) BMT at least 2 years post-BMT. URD BMT provides effective therapy for a variety of lethal hematopoietic diseases that rivals outcome of RD transplant in some cases. Use of URD marrow with a major mismatch at one HLA A or B locus is well tolerated in young, but not in older, recipients. These observations should be used to improve donor selection and counseling for URD BMT candidates.","['Davies, S M', 'Shu, X O', 'Blazar, B R', 'Filipovich, A H', 'Kersey, J H', 'Krivit, W', 'McCullough, J', 'Miller, W J', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Segall, M']","['Davies SM', 'Shu XO', 'Blazar BR', 'Filipovich AH', 'Kersey JH', 'Krivit W', 'McCullough J', 'Miller WJ', 'Ramsay NK', 'Segall M', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76428-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1636-42.,,,"['N01-A1-85002/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 29-099-04/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 135 previously untreated patients, aged under 55 years, received the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muster (BFM) induction regimen: 126 patients (93%), of which 120 were HLA-typed, achieved complete remission (CR). According to this genetic randomization, patients with (n = 43) or without an HLA-identical sibling (n = 77) were to receive allogeneic or autologous BMT, respectively. The 3-year post-CR probability of DFS was significantly higher in the HLA-identical sibling group than in the non-HLA-identical sibling group (68% v 26%; P < .001).

In differentiating FLCs, administration of hemin increases the steady-state level of ferritin mRNA about 15-fold and the ferritin content about 20- to 25-fold. Conversely, iron salts have only mild stimulatory effects on these parameters and iron chelators only slightly inhibited the stimulatory effect of hemin. Transient transfection experiments with a construct in which the human ferritin H-chain promoter drives the expression of the indicator chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene show that the increase in mRNA content is mainly due to enhanced transcription. In addition to transcriptional effects, translational regulation resulting in the further increase in ferritin synthesis is shown by CAT assays from cells transiently transfected with a construct containing the coding region for the indicator CAT mRNA under the translational control of the mRNA ferritin iron-responsive element. We conclude that, in FLCs induced to differentiate, hemin acts synergistically with the differentiation inducers, increasing ferritin expression. Both transcriptional and translational mechanisms are responsible for this synergistic effect, which appears to be characteristic of differentiated erythroid cells because it is not observed in other cell types (ie, fibroblastic cell lines).","['Coccia, E M', 'Stellacci, E', 'Orsatti, R', 'Testa, U', 'Battistini, A']","['Coccia EM', 'Stellacci E', 'Orsatti R', 'Testa U', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratory of Virology, Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Ferritins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76418-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1570-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that mixed radiation bone marrow chimeras containing Fv-4r-bearing BALB/c-Fv-4Wr (C4W) bone marrow and Fv-4r-bearing C3H/He (C3H) bone marrow grafted into C3H recipient mice (C4W+C3H-->C3H) were resistant to Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-induced leukemogenesis, even when they contained as high as 70% C3H-derived cells. This indicates that FLV-sensitive C3H-derived cells are rendered refractory to infection and/or transformation with FLV when they coexist in mice with Fv-4r-bearing cells. To investigate the mechanism of Fv-4 resistance to FLV-induced leukemogenesis, we first examined the expression of Fv-4r env antigen in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of these chimeras. The Fv-4r env antigen was present not only on C4W-derived cells, but also on Fv-4r-bearing C3H-derived cells in C4W+C3H-->C3H mixed bone marrow chimeras. The Fv-4r env antigen that binds to the cells surface of C3H cells was found in sera from normal C4W mice, C4W-->C3H chimeras, and C4W+C3H-->C3H mixed chimeras. The serum Fv-4r env antigen binds to ecotropic MuLV receptors, shown by specific binding to transfectant mink cells expressing ecotropic MuLV receptor, but not to parental mink cells. To determine whether the binding of Fv-4r env antigen to the putative MuLV receptors would block FLV infection, C3H thymocytes or spleen cells that had been preincubated with C4W serum were mixed with FLV and the subsequent production of MuLV specific antigens was examined. C3H thymocytes or spleen cells treated with C4W serum became refractory to binding by FLV. These results provide evidence that the Fv-4r env antigen is released from C4W-derived cells in vivo and binds to cells expressing surface receptors for ecotropic MuLV, thereby protecting them from infection with FLV. The implication of these findings for gene therapy of retrovirus-induced disease such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is discussed.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Ikeda, H', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Sado, T']","['Kitagawa M', 'Aizawa S', 'Kamisaku H', 'Ikeda H', 'Hirokawa K', 'Sado T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76416-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1557-63.,,,,['Fv-4'],,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies disclosed that it was frequently deleted or mutated in a variety of primary human cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The purpose of this study is to figure out the precise manners and frequencies of p16 gene inactivation in diverse hematopoietic tumor types and thus to clarify its significance in development of human hematopoietic malignancies. A total of 410 tumor specimens from patients with primary hematopoietic malignancies were examined for deletions of the p16 gene as well as the neighboring p15 gene and the nearby interferon alpha gene by Southern blot analysis. Tumor-specific mutations or small deletions of the p16 gene were also studied in 74 patients using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Loss of the p16 gene was most frequently observed among the three genes examined and was found in 59 of the 410 patients: 2 of 134 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 41 of 105 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 of 15 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 5 of 14 with adult T-cell leukemia, 4 of 33 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 of 8 with mixed-lineage leukemia, and 2 of 61 with chronic myelocytic leukemia. In 16 of the 59 patients, the p16 deletions occurred due to rearrangements within the small region between the p15 exon 2 and the p16 exon 2. Tumor-specific mutations or small deletions of the p16 gene were not detected in the 74 patients examined, including 12 of 14 patients with hemizygous deletions of the gene. Loss of the p16 gene is frequent in and highly specific to lymphoid malignancies (54 of 183 [30%] in lymphoid tumor v2 of 219 [1%] in myeloid tumors; P < .0001). The deletion analyses strongly suggest that the p16 gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located in chromosome 9p21 that is involved in development of human lymphoid tumors. Gene deletions but not minute mutations should be the predominant mechanism of p16 gene inactivation in these types of tumors.","['Ogawa, S', 'Hangaishi, A', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Hirosawa, S', 'Miura, Y', 'Takeyama, K', 'Kamada, N', 'Ohtake, S', 'Uike, N', 'Shimazaki, C']","['Ogawa S', 'Hangaishi A', 'Miyawaki S', 'Hirosawa S', 'Miura Y', 'Takeyama K', 'Kamada N', 'Ohtake S', 'Uike N', 'Shimazaki C', 'et al.']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76415-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1548-56.,,,,['MTS1'],,,,,,,,,,

In 4 V-form cases, a common break/fusion site was discovered at PML gene nucleotide (nt) 1685, abutting a 3' cryptic splice donor sequence. The fusion site was proximal to the common site in 1 case and more distal in 5 cases. The open reading frame encoding a PML-RAR alpha gene was consistently preserved, either by an in-frame fusion site or by the insertion of 3 to 127 unidentified nts. In 2 V-form cases, hybridization analysis of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products with a PML-RAR alpha juction probe was required for discrimination from L-form cases. Two V-form subgroups were defined by in vitro sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (tRA)-induced differentiation: 4 of 4 cases tested with fusion sites at or 5' to nt 1685 (subgroup E6S) had reduced sensitivity (EC50 > or = 10(-7) mol/L), whereas 4 of 4 cases with fusion sites at or 3' to nt 1709 (subgroup E6L) had high sensitivity (EC50 < 10(-8) mol/L) indistinguishable from that of L-form and S-form cases.

Its expression is maintained during differentiation along erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic lineages, but is repressed after commitment to nonexpressing lineages. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex pattern of expression, we have studied the regulation of the murine SCL promoter in erythroid and T-cell lines. Analysis of the methylation and chromatin structure of the SCL promoter region showed that SCL mRNA expression correlated with DNase hypersensitive sites and methylation status of the promoter. Transient reporter assays showed that promoter 1a was active in erythroid cells but not in T cells. Sequences between -187 and +26 were sufficient for lineage-restricted activity of promoter 1a. A joint promoter construct containing both promoter 1a and promoter 1b also exhibited lineage-restricted activity. Conserved GATA (-37), MAZ (+242), and ETS (+264) motifs were all shown to contribute to SCL promoter activity in erythroid cells, but several other motifs were not required for full promoter activity. The pattern of complexes binding to the +242 MAZ and +264 ETS sites were the same in erythroid and T cells. However, GATA-1 bound the -37 GATA site in erythroid cells, whereas in T cells GATA-3 was only able to bind weakly, if at all. Moreover, GATA-1 but not GATA-2 or GATA-3 was able to transactivate SCL promoter 1a in a T-cell environment. These results suggest that inactivity of SCL promoter 1a in T cells reflected the absence of GATA-1 rather than the presence of trans-dominant negative regulators.","['Bockamp, E O', 'McLaughlin, F', 'Murrell, A M', 'Gottgens, B', 'Robb, L', 'Begley, C G', 'Green, A R']","['Bockamp EO', 'McLaughlin F', 'Murrell AM', 'Gottgens B', 'Robb L', 'Begley CG', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76410-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1502-14.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['SCL', 'TAL-1']",['GENBANK/U01530'],,,,,,,,,

A YAC clone containing the BCL2 gene yA153A6, a 360-kb clone spanning from approximately 60 kb upstream of BCL2 exon 1 to approximately 60 kb 3' of the minor breakpoint cluster region, was used for single-color FISH analysis. Seven patients with NHL and one patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were analyzed for BCL2 translocations. Interphase nuclei of NHL patients showed three signals when hybridized with the yA153A6 probe. This was expected because the YAC clone spans the BCL2 breakpoint regions on 18q21.3. In a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a positive signal for BCL2 was detected on der(14) at band 14q32.33 by single-color FISH with the yA153A6 probe, whereas no signals were detected on der(18). The amplification of BCL2 in the HBL-2 cell line was observed on a characteristic abnormal chromosome 18, add(18)(q23); the periodic pattern of the fluorescent signal of this region was suggestive of an amplicon. Using double-color FISH with YAC clones containing the more centromeric 18q21.3 gene gastrin-releasing peptide (y302F10) and the 14q32.33 gene (IgH; Y6), we detected t(14;18) by showing the juxtaposition of the 18q21.3 and 14q32.33 bands on the derivative chromosome 18.

Thus, infection of thymocytes early in life might be directly correlated with the development of ATL. In the present study, we show that in vitro infection of mature (CD2+CD3+) or immature (CD2+CD3-) thymocytes resulted in the exogenous interleukin (IL)-2-dependent proliferation of HTLV-I-positive thymocytes, most of them displaying a CD2+CD3-CD4+ phenotype and expressing the CD25 molecule, the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor. Furthermore, the CD80 and CD54 antigens, normally expressed by thymic stromal cells, were detected on these transformed thymocytes, indicating that HTLV-I infection may disturb the cooperation between thymocytes and their thymic environment. These HTLV-I-positive thymocytes were producing significant amounts of IL-6, which was found to be implicated in their proliferation and in the expression of CD25, as demonstrated by blocking experiments using a monoclonal antibody to IL-6. The present study suggests that immature thymocytes may provide an environment favorable to the unfolding of events leading to leukemia.","['Maguer-Satta, V', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Dodon, M D']","['Maguer-Satta V', 'Gazzolo L', 'Dodon MD']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/immunology/*microbiology']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76402-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1444-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this glycoprotein is present in low abundance on the platelet surface, MoAb 14A2.H1 stimulates platelet aggregation and mediator release. We now report isolation of a cDNA clone encoding PETA-3 from a library derived from the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line MO7e. The clone encodes an open reading frame of 253 amino acids that displays 25% to 30% amino acid sequence identity with several members of the newly defined Tetraspan, or Transmembrane 4 superfamily. These proteins consist of four conserved putative transmembrane domains with a large divergent extracellular loop between the third and fourth membrane-spanning regions. PETA-3 has a single consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation located in this extracellular loop. A single PETA-3 RNA transcript (1.6 kb) was detected in RNA isolated from MO7e cells, bone marrow stromal cells, the C11 endothelial cell line, and several myeloid leukemia cell lines. No transcript was detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines MOLT-4 and BALM-1. This pattern correlates well with previous protein expression data. Northern blot analysis of RNA from a range of human tissues indicated that the transcript was present in most tissues, the notable exception being brain.","['Fitter, S', 'Tetaz, T J', 'Berndt, M C', 'Ashman, L K']","['Fitter S', 'Tetaz TJ', 'Berndt MC', 'Ashman LK']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD151 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetraspanin 24)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/*chemistry', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solubility', 'Tetraspanin 24']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76390-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1348-55.,,,,"['CD63', 'CD9', 'PETA-3']",['GENBANK/U14650'],,,,,,,,,

Most of these patients, however, later experience relapse. In addition, immunologic deficits may persist even in patients in complete remission; lymphopenia, predominantly involving the CD4 population, is universal after fludarabine therapy. We used recombinant alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) maintenance therapy in patients with CLL who achieved remission in response to fludarabine therapy to determine its effect on residual disease, assessed by either bone marrow biopsy or flow cytometry, and on immune restoration. Thirty-one patients were treated with IFN-alpha (3 x 10(6) U by subcutaneous injection three times weekly). Twenty-two patients (71%) were in complete remission (CR) and nine (29%) were in partial remission (PR). Of the 22 patients in CR, 21 (95%) had evidence of residual disease at the start of IFN-alpha therapy. Low CD4 levels were noted in 93% of patients, low IgG levels in 45%, and anergy or hypoergy in 52%. Only one patient in PR achieved a CR on IFN-alpha therapy: the only patient who had had no prior fludarabine but had been treated with chlorambucil and prednisone. All patients in CR with minimal residual disease had persistent disease after IFN-alpha treatment. There were no increases in CD4 counts or IgG levels; three patients with borderline responses to skin testing had an increase in the number of positive tests while on IFN-alpha. The time to progression was no different in patients treated with IFN-alpha than in a historical control group of patients who had received no further therapy after fludarabine. In summary, the use of IFN-alpha maintenance did not eradicate residual disease, restore immune function, or prolong remissions in patients with CLL responsive to fludarabine.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Beran, M', 'Robertson, L E', 'Koller, C', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M J']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Beran M', 'Robertson LE', 'Koller C', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Skin/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 15;86(4):1298-300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to determine if substantially lower numbers of donor leukocytes could induce remissions and, if so, whether this would reduce the 90% incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with this therapy. Twenty-two patients with relapsed CML were studied: 2 in molecular relapse, 6 in cytogenetic relapse, 10 in chronic phase, and 4 in accelerated phase. Each patient received escalating doses of donor leukocytes at 4- to 33-week intervals. Leukocyte doses were calculated as T cells per kilogram of recipient weight. There were 8 dose levels between 1 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(8). Lineage-specific chimerism and residual leukemia detection were assessed using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodologies. Nineteen of the 22 patients achieved remission. Remissions were achieved at the following T-cell doses: 1 x 10(7) (n = 8), 5 x 10(7) (n = 4), 1 x 10(8) (n = 3), and 5 x 10(8) (n = 4). To date, 15 of the 17 evaluable patients have become BCR-ABL negative by PCR. The incidence of GVHD was correlated with the dose of T cells administered. Only 1 of the 8 patients who achieved remission at a T-cell dose of 1 x 10(7)/kg developed GVHD, whereas this complication developed in 8 of the 11 responders who received a T-cell dose of > or = 5 x 10(7)/kg. Three patients died in remission, 1 secondary to marrow aplasia, 1 of respiratory failure and 1 of complications of chronic GVHD. Sixteen patients who were mixed T-cell chimeras before treatment became full donor T-cell chimeras at the time of remission. Donor leukocytes with a T-cell content as low as 1 x 10(7)/kg can result in complete donor chimerism together with a potent graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The dose of donor leukocytes or T cells used may be important in determining both the GVL response and the incidence of GVHD.

This multiparameter approach is of crucial importance for the management of patients, as it enables the identification of leukemic syndromes with distinct biological features and response to treatment. Immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies has been universally accepted as a useful adjunct to morphological criteria. This technique is particularly valuable in diagnosing and subclassifying acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is also essential in certain types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), such as AML with minimal differentiation or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic findings can be quite helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis and can add information of prognostic significance. A number of specific chromosomal abnormalities have been recognized that are very closely, and sometimes uniquely, associated with morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of leukemia. An even more basic understanding of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells has begun to evolve as molecular biology begins to unravel gene misprogramming by Southern and Northern blot analysis, the polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. With the extensive use of these techniques it has become apparent that a proportion of leukemias exhibit the biologically relevant molecular defect in the absence of a karyotypic equivalent.

Dutch Slide Review Committee of Leukemias in Adults.,297-300,"In the period from August 1991 to August 1994, the Dutch Slide Review Committee of Adult Leukemias classified 14 leukemias as AML-M0. We reviewed the clinical characteristics and response to therapy of these patients. Eight patients were male. Patients' age ranged from 7 to 77 years (medium age 62 years). There was a striking homogeneity in morphological appearance of the blasts, being small to medium-sized round cells with often an eccentric nucleus with fine chromatin, several distinct nucleoli, and a high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. In addition to myeloid-associated markers such as CD13 and CD33, the blasts of all patients were positive for CD34 and HLA-DR, pointing to their immature differentiation stage. TdT was present in the blasts of 71%, CD7 was positive in the blasts of 42% of the patients. No consistent cytogenetic abnormalities were found. With respect to the treatment outcome, four patients achieved a complete remission after remission-induction treatment. The median survival was 4.5 months. Our present study shows AML-M0 to be an immature leukemia, uniform in morphology and immunological phenotype, with no consistent cytogenetic phenotype and with a poor clinical outcome.","['Segeren, C M', 'de Jong-Gerrits, G C', ""van 't Veer, M B""]","['Segeren CM', 'de Jong-Gerrits GC', ""van 't Veer MB""]","['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01696615 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1995 Jun;70(6):297-300. doi: 10.1007/BF01696615.,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,

A possible cause of atypical cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia.,925-9,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous pseudolymphomas were encountered in eight patients who were receiving the antidepressant (AD) medications fluoxetine hydrochloride and amitriptyline hydrochloride, which promote tumor growth and suppress certain lymphoid functions by inhibiting the binding of endogenous histamine to an intracellular histamine receptor designated HIC. OBSERVATIONS: Lesions appeared in all patients following the start of AD therapy and resolved or improved in all seven who discontinued AD therapy. Skin lesions were solitary in three patients and multiple in five. Four patients were being treated with other drugs that altered lymphocyte function, and three had underlying systemic diseases that were associated with immune dysregulation. There were four histological patterns: mycosis fungoides-like, lymphocytoma cutis, lymphomatoid vascular reaction, and follicular mucinosis. Common to the first group were histological features of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that enabled distinction from mycosis fungoides. More problematic was the distinction of lymphocytoma cutis lesions from low-grade lymphocytic neoplasms. The lymphocytoma cutis lesions were rich in B cells; the other cases were dominated by T lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous pseudolymphomas are associated with AD therapy, possibly reflecting perturbation of lymphoid function. Concomitant therapy with agents that have additive or synergistic immunomodulatory effects or an immune-dysregulating systemic disease may increase a patient's susceptibility to developing atypical cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia while the patient is receiving AD therapy.","['Crowson, A N', 'Magro, C M']","['Crowson AN', 'Magro CM']","['Central Medical Laboratories, Misericordia General Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', '1806D8D52K (Amitriptyline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amitriptyline/*adverse effects', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology', 'Female', 'Fluoxetine/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archderm.131.8.925 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1995 Aug;131(8):925-9. doi: 10.1001/archderm.131.8.925.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia has been found more frequently in patients with NF and may present with various cutaneous manifestations, including JXG. To our knowledge, the relationship among these three entities has never been explored. The purpose of the present study is to explore this relationship by using a systematic review of the literature. We present five demonstrative cases of various associations among NF, JCML, and JXG. RESULTS: A family history of NF was found in 85% to 95% of children with NF and JCML (with or without JXG), as compared with that found in 47% of children with NF and JXG. The observed frequency of the triple association is 30-fold to 40-fold higher than that expected. It is estimated that children with NF and JXG have a 20-fold to 32-fold higher risk for JCML than do patients with NF who do not have JXG. CONCLUSIONS: A concomitant finding of JCML and JXG in children with NF represents a true association, rather than a coincidence. A finding of JXG in an infant with NF should alert a physician to a possible development of JCML.","['Zvulunov, A', 'Barak, Y', 'Metzker, A']","['Zvulunov A', 'Barak Y', 'Metzker A']","[""Dermatology Unit, Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tiqwa.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Xanthogranuloma, Juvenile/*complications/epidemiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1995 Aug;131(8):904-8.,,['Arch Dermatol. 1996 Nov;132(11):1390-1.

The current study was designed to investigate whether 1,25(OH)2D3 protects the transplantable rat chloroleukemia (C51) cells from the cytotoxic effects of Cytoxan. In vitro, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on C51 cells. In separate experiments, preincubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 did not protect the C51 cells from the cytotoxic effects of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. In vivo, 4 groups of 10 5-day-old rats were treated as follows: Groups 1 and 2 received 0.2 micrograms of 1,25(OH)2D3 topically in ethanol daily starting on day 5 through day 10. Groups 3 and 4 received ethanol topically similarly. On day 7, all rats received 1 x 10(5) C51 cells intraperitoneally. On day 11, groups 1 and 3 received 35 mg/kg Cytoxan intraperitoneally. All rats in groups 2 and 4 were dead of leukemia by day 34. In groups 1 and 3, only 1 of 10 and 2 of 10 rats died of leukemia, respectively. Alopecia developed in all rats in group 3. In contrast, all rats in group 1 were protected from Cytoxan-induced alopecia. These results indicate that, in vivo, pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not protect the rat chloroleukemia cells from the cytotoxic effect of Cytoxan, while protecting from Cytoxan-induced alopecia.","['Jimenez, J J', 'Alvarez, E', 'Bustamante, C D', 'Yunis, A A']","['Jimenez JJ', 'Alvarez E', 'Bustamante CD', 'Yunis AA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33101, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Alopecia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Calcitriol/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)35039-4 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199508000-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1995 Aug;310(2):43-7. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199508000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the cytologic findings of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of recurrent CML in extramedullary sites in 11 patients with CML. The patients' ages ranged from 24 to 62 years (median, 38 years). There were seven male and four female patients. The aspiration sites were mostly lymph nodes (cervical in 7, retroperitoneal in 2, axillary in 1) and abdominal wall soft tissue (1). The numbers of blasts in the aspirates ranged from 27% to over 90%. Confirmation of the myeloid nature of the blasts was done using naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase in one case. Cytologic and flow cytometric immunotyping was done in eight cases. Two cases were based on cytomorphologic features only. Two of the eight immunophenotyped aspirates showed evidence of T-lymphoblastic differentiation. Another showed a mixed myeloid and T-cell phenotype. Blasts were seen in the peripheral blood and bone marrow in 4 of the 11 patients. We thus conclude that extramedullary involvement by CML in our series was associated with younger age, high incidence of cervical lymphadenopathy, increased blasts and frequent lack of bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement. T-cell phenotypes appeared to be higher in our series than reported in the literature. This suggests that there is a need for phenotyping some aspirates of recurrent extramedullary CML, mainly to evaluate the possibility of dedifferentiation and its possible impact on the behavior of the neoplasm.","['Mourad, W A', 'Sneige, N', 'Huh, Y O', 'Katz, R L', 'Caraway, N P', 'Corck, A', 'Wojcik, E']","['Mourad WA', 'Sneige N', 'Huh YO', 'Katz RL', 'Caraway NP', 'Corck A', 'Wojcik E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Recurrence']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1995 Jul-Aug;39(4):706-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Platelet transfusions in these patients are frequently complicated by the recipient's development of antibodies to HLA class I antigens. When these patients become refractory to the transfusion of HLA-matched platelets, the recipient's platelet antigen phenotype must be determined, to ensure that donor platelets will be phenotypically compatible. Cases of alloimmunization to HPA-1a and HPA-1b resulting in refractoriness to transfused platelets and the subsequent development of a posttransfusion purpura-like syndrome are reported. CASE REPORTS: In the first case, a 43-year-old woman with Stage IV infiltrating ductal breast cancer presented to the hospital for a transplant of autologous peripheral blood stem cells. After the transplant, her platelet count remained less than 10 x 10(9) per L, despite daily platelet transfusions, including HLA-matched platelets. Fourteen days following the transplant, her serum was found to contain anti-HPA-1a. Initially, the patient was refractory to the transfusion of HPA-1a-negative platelets, but after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, she had transient increases in posttransfusion platelet counts. She was also treated with a staphylococcal protein A immunoadsorption column and has not had any such subsequent refractoriness. Her genotype has been found, by use of allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization with white cell DNA, to be HPA-1b/1b. The second case involved a 32-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia who received an unrelated-donor marrow transplant. Three years later, her CML recurred, and she was treated with interferon-alpha. Four months afterward, she experienced interferon-alpha-induced thrombocytopenia and the interferon therapy was discontinued. She received 12 platelet transfusions in 20 days, but none was effective. Antibodies specific for HLA antigens and HPA-1b were detected, and three HLA-matched, HPA-1b-negative apheresis platelet components were given, but without effect. Two days after treatment with methylprednisolone (1 g intravenously) and prednisone (2 mg/kg/day orally), her platelet count was 26 x 10(9) per L, and after 8 more days, it was 102 x 10(9) per L, without further transfusions. She was found to be homozygous for HPA-1a (HPA-1a/1a). CONCLUSION: Anti-HPA-1a and anti-HPA-1b can cause refractoriness to platelet transfusions in bone marrow transplant patients. Testing for platelet-specific antibodies should be considered in all patients who are refractory to HLA-matched platelets.","['Evenson, D A', 'Stroncek, D F', 'Pulkrabek, S', 'Perry, E H', 'Radford, J', 'Miller, J S', 'Verfaillie, C']","['Evenson DA', 'Stroncek DF', 'Pulkrabek S', 'Perry EH', 'Radford J', 'Miller JS', 'Verfaillie C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinics, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Isoantibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/*etiology', 'Time Factors']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357902.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Aug;35(8):688-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357902.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reports of cytokine-mobilized blood progenitor cells in allogeneic transplant recipients are rare. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a pilot trial of six patients. Patients with advanced hematologic malignancy received bone marrow (median total 2.6 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg) followed by four daily transfusions of blood (median total 9.5 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg) from HLA-matched sibling donors who were mobilized with recombinant human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (5 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously for 5 days). All patients received cyclosporine and prednisone for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: An absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 per mm3 was achieved on Day 12, and platelet transfusion independence was achieved on Day 16. The median day of hospital discharge was Day 23 after transplant. All patients achieved 100-percent donor cell engraftment. Acute > or = Grade III GVHD did not develop in any patients, but all patients developed Grade I (n = 4) or Grade II (n = 2) acute GVHD. Chronic extensive GVHD developed in four of six patients. One patient died of pneumonia 263 days after transplant while undergoing immune-suppressive therapy for chronic GVHD. CONCLUSION: The transfusion of blood stem cells in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant is well tolerated soon after transplant, but the development of chronic GVHD may limit the general usage of unmanipulated blood stem cells.","['Nemunaitis, J', 'Rosenfeld, C', 'Collins, R', 'Pallansch, P', 'Pineiro, L', 'Ohr, S', 'Waxman, D', 'Stone, M', 'Fay, J', 'Miller, W']","['Nemunaitis J', 'Rosenfeld C', 'Collins R', 'Pallansch P', 'Pineiro L', 'Ohr S', 'Waxman D', 'Stone M', 'Fay J', 'Miller W', 'et al.']","['Sammons Cancer Center, Baylor University Medical Center, Texas Oncology, P.A., USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357898.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Aug;35(8):666-73. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357898.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The platelet transfusion records of 128 consecutive children admitted to the hospital and requiring blood component support for the treatment of disease were evaluated retrospectively. Mean corrected count increments (CCIs) for each patient were calculated for all random-donor platelet transfusions given within 7 days of the routine weekly testings of the patient's serum for lymphocytotoxic antibodies (LCTAbs). Mean CCIs for HLA-matched platelet transfusions were calculated separately for the patients receiving them. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (24%) had or developed persistently positive LCTAbs (patient's serum reacted with > or = 3/10 panel lymphocytes); 22 (71%) of these patients had a mean CCI < 7.5 to random-donor platelet transfusions. In contrast, of the 97 patients with negative or transiently positive LCTAbs, only 25 (26%) had a mean CCI < 7.5. The overall incidence of platelet refractoriness (CCI < 7.5) was 37 percent. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia had a significantly (p < 0.01) reduced incidence (17%) of low CCIs, with or without positive LCTAbs, as compared to patients with other malignant or nonmalignant disorders (41%). No difference in the incidence of LCTAbs or low CCIs was seen in patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplant or receiving drug therapy only. Among the 24 patients who received HLA-matched platelets, only those with positive LCTAbs showed a significant improvement in CCIs over that achieved with random-donor platelet transfusions. Routine white cell reduction in red cell and platelet components with third-generation white cell filters was performed prior to transfusion in 73 of the patients. There was no significant difference between the incidence of LCTAbs and/or low CCIs in this group and that in the 55 children receiving unfiltered transfusions. CONCLUSION: Alloimmunization and platelet refractoriness occur in pediatric oncology and bone marrow transplant patients, but the incidence--particularly in children with acute myelogenous leukemia--appears to be low. The detection of LCTAbs predicts a poor response to random-donor platelet transfusion, but most such patients show improved CCIs with HLA-matched platelets. Routine use of white cell-reduction filters has thus far failed to eliminate alloimmunization in children requiring prolonged blood component support.","['Hogge, D E', 'McConnell, M', 'Jacobson, C', 'Sutherland, H J', 'Benny, W B', 'Massing, B G']","['Hogge DE', 'McConnell M', 'Jacobson C', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Benny WB', 'Massing BG']","['Cell Separator Unit, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoantibodies/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357895.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Aug;35(8):645-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357895.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve to 72 weeks after 11 patients underwent ABO-incompatible BMT, titers of anti-A and anti-B were assayed, A and B antigens were identified by routine methods and flow cytometry, direct and indirect antiglobulin tests were performed, and the red cell antibody was eluted. RESULTS: In some patients who underwent ABO-incompatible BMT, anti-A and/or anti-B produced by the B cells from the donor marrow could not be detected after BMT when red cells taken from the patients before BMT carried the corresponding antigen--that is, when hematopoiesis had already changed the cells to the donor's type according to ABO blood typing. Furthermore, some blood samples from those patients gave positive results in direct antiglobulin tests. Blood typing of patients after BMT showed mixed-field agglutination. In one patient, the half-life of red cells assayed with 51Cr was 22.4 days (30.0 +/- 4.0 days for normal controls). CONCLUSION: Although many hypotheses could be considered to explain the present data, the possibility is proposed that anti-A and/or anti-B in the sera must have been consumed in some patients who underwent ABO-incompatible BMT. This may lead to problems such as difficulty of ABO typing, positive direct antiglobulin tests, and a relatively short life span of red cells.","['Maeda, K', 'Taniwaki, K', 'Santo, T', 'Itsukuma, T', 'Ito, M', 'Anan, K', 'Misawa, M', 'Ohe, Y', 'Kai, S', 'Hara, H']","['Maeda K', 'Taniwaki K', 'Santo T', 'Itsukuma T', 'Ito M', 'Anan K', 'Misawa M', 'Ohe Y', 'Kai S', 'Hara H']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Autoantibodies)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357893.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Aug;35(8):635-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35895357893.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analysed whether PML, like Sp100, is also an autoantigen in patients with PBC and other autoimmune diseases, and wether both proteins interact directly. Testing sera from autoimmune patients using an immunoprecipitation assay with radiolabelled PML and an immunofluorescence assay based on a cell line overexpressing PML, autoantibodies (Aabs) against PML were found in the majority o anti-Sp100 Aab positive patients. Only very few patients with PBC or other autoimmune diseases contained anti-PML or anti-Sp100 Aabs exclusively. In contrast to Sp100, immunoreactivity of recombinant PML in immunoblots was only weak and was directed to one region. This suggests that anti-PML Aabs recognize fewer and preferentially conformation-dependent epitopes. In an immunoprecipitation assay using in vitro synthesized Sp100 and PML proteins and Abs to recombinant proteins, no direct interaction was observed. Taken together, these data indicate that Aabs against PML are as highly prevalent and specific for patients with PBC as those against Sp100. The colocalization of these autoantigens and the frequent co-occurrence of the corresponding Aabs might reflect an association of both proteins mediated by one or several other proteins.","['Sternsdorf, T', 'Guldner, H H', 'Szostecki, C', 'Grotzinger, T', 'Will, H']","['Sternsdorf T', 'Guldner HH', 'Szostecki C', 'Grotzinger T', 'Will H']","['Heinrich-Pette Institute of Experimental Virology and Immunology, University of Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/blood/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/*immunology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1995.tb03652.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1995 Aug;42(2):257-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1995.tb03652.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although capable of selective binding to the RAR gamma nuclear receptor, AHPN inhibited the growth of a number of HBC cell lines via RAR- or RXR-independent pathways. AHPN also inhibited the growth of the human leukemia cell line HL-60R which does not possess functional RARs. RA significantly inhibited AP-1 mediated gene activation in MCF-7 cells while AHPN displayed no such anti-AP-1 activity. Retinoids normally are cytostatic in their inhibition of breast carcinoma growth and permit cell proliferation upon their removal, wher as AHPN induced G0/G1 arrest within 6h followed by apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells that harbor wild type p53, AHPN-induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis was accompanied by p53-independent regulation of WAF1/CIP1 as well as bax mRNA levels while bcl-2 mRNA levels were decreased. In MDA-MB-231 cells which possess a mutant p53, AHPN-mediated G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis was also associated with a concomitant up regulation of WAF1/CIP1 mRNA while these cells did not express bax or bcl-2 messages. Thus AHPN represents a novel retinoid that induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis via a unique pathway which appears to involve activation of known downstream effectors of p53 in a p53-independent manner.","['Shao, Z M', 'Dawson, M I', 'Li, X S', 'Rishi, A K', 'Sheikh, M S', 'Han, Q X', 'Ordonez, J V', 'Shroot, B', 'Fontana, J A']","['Shao ZM', 'Dawson MI', 'Li XS', 'Rishi AK', 'Sheikh MS', 'Han QX', 'Ordonez JV', 'Shroot B', 'Fontana JA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CD 437)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1995/08/03 00:00,1995/08/03 00:01,['1995/08/03 00:00'],"['1995/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Aug 3;11(3):493-504.,,,"['CA 51993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['CIP1', 'WAF1', 'bax', 'bcl-2']",,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids exert their diverse morphologic effects through a signalling pathway which involves the nuclear retinoid receptors. Defective retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function contributes to the malignant phenotype of several human and experimental tumors. Considerable evidence from gene disruption studies now suggests that one of the RARs, RAR gamma, may directly mediate some retinoid effects on embryonic and malignant cells. We, firstly, examined primary NB tumor tissue for a correlation between endogenous RAR gamma expression and clinical stage of the tumor and secondly, the effects of exogenous over-expression of the RAR gamma gene on a human NB tumor cell line. RAR gamma mRNA expression in 32 primary NB tumor tissue samples were significantly higher in clinically localised tumors compared with advanced or disseminated tumors. The human NB tumor cell line, BE(2)-C, was stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector (pREP4) over-expressing the human RAR gamma cDNA. Two selected clones over-expressing RAR gamma (BE/G1 and 2) exhibited a reduced growth rate compared to control cells. Tumorigenicity was inhibited for BE/G1 cells and there was a delayed onset to tumor formation for BE/G2 cells. aRA caused growth inhibition but not neuritic differentiation of the BE/G clones, while 9-cis-retinoic acid caused both growth arrest and neuritic differentiation. Taken together these results suggest that reduced endogenous RAR gamma expression may contribute to the malignant phenotype of human NB. In NB cells the retinoid signalling pathway for neuritic differentiation may be distinct from that causing growth inhibition.","['Marshall, G M', 'Cheung, B', 'Stacey, K P', 'Camacho, M L', 'Simpson, A M', 'Kwan, E', 'Smith, S', 'Haber, M', 'Norris, M D']","['Marshall GM', 'Cheung B', 'Stacey KP', 'Camacho ML', 'Simpson AM', 'Kwan E', 'Smith S', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adrenal Glands/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurites/ultrastructure', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1995/08/03 00:00,1995/08/03 00:01,['1995/08/03 00:00'],"['1995/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Aug 3;11(3):485-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In myeloid differentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells, permeabilized with either digitonin, streptolysin O or Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, binding of GTP[gamma S] induced by three distinct chemoattractant receptors was observed. The extent of receptor-stimulated GTP[gamma S] binding (maximally about 2-fold) was independent of the type of permeabilizing agent used. In human erythroleukemia cells permeabilized with digitonin, agonist activation of thrombin and neuropeptide Y receptors increased GTP[gamma S] binding by 1.8- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Finally, in adherently grown human embryonic kidney cells permeabilized with digitonin, activation of the stably expressed human muscarinic m3 receptor increased GTP[gamma S] binding by about 1.6-fold. In digitonin-permeabilized HL-60 cells, a quantitative analysis of formyl peptide receptors and interacting G proteins was performed. About 50,000 formyl peptide receptors per cell were detected. Agonist binding to these receptors was fully sensitive to regulation by guanine nucleotides and pertussis toxin. The number of high-affinity GTP[gamma S] binding sites, most likely representing heterotrimeric G proteins, was calculated to be about 670,000 per cell. Stimulation of formyl peptide receptors led to the activation of about 130,000 of high-affinity GTP[gamma S] binding sites, indicating a ratio of about three activated G proteins per one agonist-activated receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Wieland, T', 'Liedel, K', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch, S', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf, D', 'Schmidt, M', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Liedel K', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch S', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf D', 'Schmidt M', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitat, GH Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotactic Factors/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*metabolism"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00169072 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 1995 Apr;351(4):329-36. doi: 10.1007/BF00169072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Levels of GM-CSF RNA were less than basal level at 24 h after exposure to irradiation alone. In contrast, cells cultured with TNF (1 h) and then irradiated, had prominent expression of GM-CSF mRNA at 24 h.

Moreover, TNF stabilized GM-CSF mRNA at 24 h after irradiation; 4 increased from < 20 min in untreated cells to > 2 h in cells cultured initially with TNF and followed by irradiation. We repeated the same experiments with IL-1 and found that IL-1 had the same effects on accumulation, transcription, and stabilization of GM-CSF RNA.

This variant procedure allows retrospective analysis of mRNA and is used in the present study to evaluate the lineage of leukemic blasts in seven cases with morphology and cytochemistry consistent with AUL. All hematology smears used in this study were air-dried, unstained or Wright-stained and stored at room temperature for periods varying between 3 days and 2 years.

To address this question, we analysed results obtained from an in vitro model for the clonal production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) by individual primitive multilineage precursors in adult human bone marrow. The primitive precursors adhere to plastic and produce CFU-GM in a 1-week long 'delta' type culture. The clones that form are classified as having short maturation pathways (clones containing predominantly day 7 CFU-GM) or long maturation pathways (clones containing predominantly day 21 CFU-GM). The results indicate that individual primitive (P delta) cells produce clones that reach full maturity after different periods of time so that cells corresponding to a range of maturational stages can become available simultaneously. Consequently, transplanted stem cells may be able to provide both rapid and long-term mature cell recovery whilst at the same time reconstituting the stem cell pool. These results suggest that it might be possible to use highly purified stem cell populations, devoid of committed progenitors, for clinical transplantation.","['Gordon, M Y', 'Blackett, N M', 'Lewis, J L', 'Goldman, J M']","['Gordon MY', 'Blackett NM', 'Lewis JL', 'Goldman JM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Plastics)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/methods', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Plastics', 'Time Factors']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1252-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The population within the Northern Region of England is 3.09 million. During the study period a total of 149 de novo patients between 15 and 55 years old presented. The incidence of AML was 0.79 per 10(5) (age-specific population) in the 15-24-year-old group, 0.85 per 10(5) in the group 25-39 years old and 1.35 per 10(5) in the 40-55-year-old group. Remission induction success varied with age (74% for patients < 40 years and 58% for patients 40-55 years). In the 15-40 year old group 28 patients had an HLA-matched donor, 22 patients had a transplant (one syngeneic) and 24 patients in the 15-40-year-old group in remission at 6 months did not have a transplant. The allogeneic group < 40 years old had an event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years of 62%, whereas patients of the same age who received chemotherapy alone had an EFS at 4 years of 24%. A small heterogeneous group of 14 patients who had intensification with autotransplant are not included in this analysis. The population study approach demonstrates the difficulties of introducing uniform treatment strategy in this disease group. The study confirms the view that allogeneic transplant in first remission in the 15-40-year-old group is the treatment of choice. Unfortunately the overall impact of transplant on the population is not great since only 22 of 149 patients (14%) were able to receive an allograft in first remission.","['Proctor, S J', 'Taylor, P R', 'Stark, A', 'Carey, P J', 'Bown, N', 'Hamilton, P J', 'Reid, M M']","['Proctor SJ', 'Taylor PR', 'Stark A', 'Carey PJ', 'Bown N', 'Hamilton PJ', 'Reid MM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1246-51.,,['Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1288-9.

However, results obtained from uncultured tumor samples have led to discussion of the relevance of these findings. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot analysis, we have investigated p16INK4A gene at both RNA and genomic levels in various types of leukemias: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 23); acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 22) and B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPD) (n = 33). p16INK4A mRNA expression was not found in only 1/20 AML and 2/23 CLPD samples. Conversely, p16INK4A mRNA was not detected in 5/17 ALL cases, and intensity of PCR products were barely detectable in seven additional cases, possibly related to the contamination by normal cells in some cases. By Southern blotting, a homozygous deletion of p16INK4A gene was found in 6/17 ALL cases (35%) among which 4/6 were negative or weakly positive by RT-PCR assay. None of the five AML and 20 CLL samples studied had p16INK4A deletion. Sequence analysis of p16INK4A exon 2 did not show point mutation in two of these cases lacking mRNA expression. Our data provide further evidence that among hematological malignancies, ALL are the most likely to be associated with p16INK4A inactivation, mainly by homozygous gene deletion. Since most hematological malignancies-except ALL-are infrequently associated with p16INK4A and retinoblastoma (Rb) gene alteration it seems worthwhile to explore cdk4 and cdk6 expression to determine whether or not the disruption of the p16INK4A/Rb/cdk4/cdk6 regulatory loop might play a role in their pathogenesis.","['Delmer, A', 'Tang, R', 'Senamaud-Beaufort, C', 'Paterlini, P', 'Brechot, C', 'Zittoun, R']","['Delmer A', 'Tang R', 'Senamaud-Beaufort C', 'Paterlini P', 'Brechot C', 'Zittoun R']","['Hematology Department, Hotel Dieu, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1240-5.,,,,"['MTS1', 'p16<up>INK4A</up>']",,,,,,,,,,

The MIELIKI cell line displays an early pre-B cell phenotype (CD10+, CD19+, CD20+, CD34-, Cmu-, sIg-) with rearrangements on both Ig heavy chain and k light chain alleles, and carries an unfrequent t(7;9) chromosomal translocation identical to the freshly isolated leukemic blasts. The proliferation of MIELIKI cells was abrogated by IL-4 and by IL-7, as measured by DNA replication and viable cell recovery. The effects of IL-4 and IL-7 were mediated, respectively, through the CDw124 and CDw127 IL-4 and IL-7 receptor components.

Flt3 receptor and ligand expression were also examined by Northern blot analysis. Flt3 receptor was expressed on the surface of only two of nine murine cell lines and nine of 15 human cell lines, with positive cells representing the B cell, early myeloid, and monocytic lineages. Staining for surface expression of the flt3 ligand revealed that seven of nine murine cell lines and nine of 15 human cell lines screened were positive by flow cytometry. All murine and human cell lines assayed were positive for flt3 ligand RNA expression by Northern blot analysis, but not all cell lines expressing flt3 ligand mRNA had detectable surface expression. Cells expressing the flt3 ligand were of the myeloid, B cell and T cell lineages at various stages of differentiation. Only the OCI-AML-5, NALM-6, and AML-193 cell lines coexpressed both surface flt3 receptor and ligand. The myeloid leukemic M1 cell terminally differentiate into macrophage-like cells under the influence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We found that LIF-stimulated M1 cells down-regulated surface expression and mRNA levels of the flt3 receptor, but up-regulated expression of the flt3 ligand.

Although all patients tested had serologic evidence for past infection with EBV, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA utilizing specific EBV primers demonstrated the presence of EBV-DNA in only six of 17 CD3- LDGL cases. A previous history of HBV infection, as defined by the presence of circulating IgG anti-HBc antibodies associated with either HBsAg positivity or negativity, was documented in seven cases; however, viral DNA was not detected in PBMC of these patients using PCR with specific HBV primers. Specific anti-HCV antibodies, confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay, were detected in five CD3- LDGL patients; PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in PBMC of two of these cases. No patient had antibodies to HTLV-I/II or HIV-1/2. Five patients were infected by more than one virus (two with HBV and EBV and three with HBV and HCV). Our results provide serologic evidence for past viral infection in the large majority of CD3- NK-type LDGL patients.

The susceptibility of AKR mice to spontaneous and induced T cell lymphomagenesis.,1199-206,"The AKR inbred mouse strain displays a high incidence of spontaneous T cell lymphomas that arise predominantly in the thymus of 6 to 12-month-old mice. Heterogenous nonacute transforming retroviruses are associated with the etiology of the disease: the endogenous ecotropic viruses (inherited in AKR mice at two non-linked chromosomal loci, Akv-1 and Akv-2), the xenotropic virus and recombinant viruses. Prevention of spontaneous T cell lymphomagenesis in AKR mice by passive anti-viral immunotherapy was accomplished by suppressing endogenous ecotropic virus release. Treatment with monoclonal antibody Hy-72 reacting only with Akv1 type ecotropic viruses, or with mAb 18-5 with specificity for both ecotropic and MCF recombinant virus envelope glycoprotein (administered from birth for 10 days) inhibited similarly T cell lymphoma development. A reduced thymus cellularity observed in these mAb treated mice coincided with reduced level of earliest intrathymic low CD4 precursor population in their thymus. The role of endogenous viruses (MuLV) and presence of potential lymphoma cells (PLCs) (identified among bone marrow cells of untreated AKR mice) in enhanced T cell lymphomagenesis in AKR mice, triggered by different leukemogenic agents, was evaluated. Intrathymic injection of the radiation leukemia virus variant A-RadLV or administration of methylnitrosourea resulted in a high lymphoma incidence within a short latent period of 80-100 days irrespective of the presence or absence of MuLV or PLCs in these treated mice. Thus, a direct action of these agents on thymocytes seems to occur. The high susceptibility of untreated AKR mice to radiation induced T cell lymphomagenesis was not affected by pretreatment with mAb Hy-72; in contrast to markedly reduced sensitivity following pretreatment with mAb 18-5 (15 vs 100%). The mAb 18-5 induced resistance to radiation lymphomagenesis seems to be related to defects in the bone marrow stem cell pool as well as in the thymus microenvironment of mAb 18-5 treated mice. Thus, different developmental pathways are involved in enhanced T cell lymphomagenesis in AKR mice.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Peled, A', 'Wu, L', 'Shortman, K', 'Brightman, B K', 'Fan, H']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Peled A', 'Wu L', 'Shortman K', 'Brightman BK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/prevention & control/virology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/prevention & control/virology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1199-206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether treatment of HL60 cells with 9-cis RA and D3 can lead to growth arrest and a failure to undergo cell differentiation. This occurred in two circumstances and HL60 cells died rapidly by apoptosis. First, treatment with 5 x 10(-7) M 9-cis RA and 1.25 x 10(-9)-3.1 x 10(-10) M D3 promoted growth arrest and apoptosis of HL60 cells. The amount of 9-cis RA alone promoted significant neutrophil differentiation of HL60 cells. The amounts of D3 alone promoted a very low level of monocyte differentiation. Treatment with each agent alone did not result in increased levels of apoptosis. Second, HL60 cells were treated with concentrations of 9-cis RA (5 x 10(-7) M) and D3 (3.9 x 10(-14) M) that were appropriate for induction of neutrophil differentiation. At the time when they were undergoing commitment to the neutrophil pathway of differentiation (days 1-2), an amount of D3 (1 x 10(-7) M) that promotes monocyte differentiation was added to the cultures. HL60 cells failed to differentiate and died by apoptosis. Hence, certain combinations of signals, elicited by 9-cis RA and D3, promote apoptosis of HL60 cells. This finding has important implications for the use of retinoids and D3 in differentiation therapy.","['Wallington, L A', 'Bunce, C M', 'Durham, J', 'Brown, G']","['Wallington LA', 'Bunce CM', 'Durham J', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1185-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maturation resistant NB4-R1 cells exhibited an onset of cell death after RA-treatment (72 h), whereas maturation responsive NB4 cells showed no such apoptosis, cell death being considerably delayed after cell maturation. Only a few NB4-R1 cells underwent apoptosis in response to low doses of RA (below 0.1 microM), the surviving cells became refractory to higher doses of RA. While these cells became 'resistant' to apoptosis they became competent for maturation. Typically, these RA-'primed' cells responded to cAMP by maturation, then apoptosis followed rapidly. This model furnishes situations where cells are either resistant or susceptible to apoptosis, depending on whether they can or cannot undergo maturation. The potential role of the Bcl-2 protein in the regulation of apoptosis was analyzed. In NB4 and NB4-R1 cell lines, a high expression of the Bcl-2 protein was detected by immunocytology and Western blotting. NB4 cells treated with either all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid (1 microM) were induced to differentiate and the level of Bcl-2 protein decreased to undetectable levels during terminal maturation when only a few apoptotic cells were detected. In NB4-R1 cells, while treatment with retinoids does not induce maturation, as much as 64% of cells became apoptotic, and immunocytological labelling of NB4-R1 showed a strong cytoplasmic labelling of Bcl-2. Although the expression of Bcl-2 remained high, cells were not protected from apoptosis. To assess whether Bcl-2 expression could be modulated as a consequence of differentiation, NB4-R1 cells previously 'primed' for maturation were triggered with cAMP. Downregulation of Bcl-2 protein occurred concomitant with maturation, followed by apoptosis. Clearly, NB4 and NB4-R1 cells show reciprocal behavior with regards to proliferation, maturation, Bcl-2 regulation and apoptosis in response to RA. Our results suggest, first, that the Bcl-2 downregulation in NB4 cells belongs to the maturation program rather than to apoptosis, and second, that neither a high Bcl-2 expression in NB4 cells is sufficient to protect cells from 9-cis RA induced apoptosis, nor is its full downregulation sufficient to produce apoptosis. Finally, this work suggests that apoptosis and maturation programs include events which cannot occur simultaneously.","['Bruel, A', 'Benoit, G', 'De Nay, D', 'Brown, S', 'Lanotte, M']","['Bruel A', 'Benoit G', 'De Nay D', 'Brown S', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-301, Centre G Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1173-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new in situ hybridization (ISH) technique was used to examine the origin of the progenitor cells. Two patients with respectively, trisomy 8 and polyploidy as ISH marker were studied both at presentation and during remission. At presentation, the in vitro cultured clusters of both cases appeared diploid. Therefore, despite the abnormal growth patterns, the cultured progenitors could have been residual normal cells. Alternatively, they could have originated from a preleukemic clone with a normal karyotype. In both cases abnormal BM and/or PB cells (less than 6%) were detected with ISH during remission, indicating partially or completely clonal remissions in these patients. Both patients have relapsed. One patient with trisomy 10 as ISH marker was analyzed during myelodysplastic phase and after progression to AML. On both occasions, abnormally appearing clusters were cultured. However, only part of the clusters carried trisomy 10. The presence of a subclone characterized by trisomy 10 and an abnormally growing (pre)leukemic clone without trisomy 10 may explain this observation. Monosomy 1 and 17 were respectively used as ISH markers in two other AML patients. All in vitro cultured clusters carried the numerical abnormality. Long-term liquid cultures of these leukemias were performed for 10-20 days. In both cases, no residual normal clonogenic cells could be detected. Therefore, the selective growth advantage of normal progenitor cells in long-term marrow cultures could not be demonstrated in these two patients with leukemia. This paper illustrates the usefulness of ISH to study the biology of AML at the clonogenic level during preleukemic phase, active disease, remission, and under in vitro culture conditions. It is a sensitive technique which allows individual analysis of large numbers of small aggregates and single cells in culture.","['Van Der Lely, N', 'Poddighe, P', 'Wessels, J', 'Hopman, A', 'Geurts van Kessel, A', 'De Witte, T']","['Van Der Lely N', 'Poddighe P', 'Wessels J', 'Hopman A', 'Geurts van Kessel A', 'De Witte T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1167-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), carried out with an alphoid DNA probe specific for chromosome 7 centromere, showed that a small marker chromosome present in the tumor cells' karyotype of the three patients, was derived from the missing chromosome 7. In two cases, the marker was a ring chromosome, whereas in the third case it was a tiny dot-like chromosome, unnoticed at first examination on R-banded metaphases. In the three cases, the marker was lost in a proportion of tumor cells. FISH experiments suggested that the marker centromere had undergone structural alterations, with a fluorescence pattern distinct from a normal one. On the whole, these data suggest that: firstly, leukemia-associated monosomy 7 results, in a proportion of cases, from a structural event rather than from simple loss of a whole chromosome 7; secondly, interpretation of interphase FISH must be cautious in monosomy 7 evaluation; and thirdly structural alteration of the chromosome 7 derivative alphoid DNA could explain its propensity to segregate unequally and to be lost at mitosis.","['Viguie, F', 'Prigent, Y', 'Ramond, S', 'Baumelou, E', 'Cadiou, M', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Zittoun, R']","['Viguie F', 'Prigent Y', 'Ramond S', 'Baumelou E', 'Cadiou M', 'Dreyfus F', 'Zittoun R']","['Laboratoire de Biologie de la Fertilite et de Cytogenetique, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jul;9(7):1154-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the incidence of chromosome 17 abnormalities in 55 patients with NHL by using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a directly conjugated centromeric probe for chromosome 17. Twenty-three patients (42%) were previously untreated. Thirty-four patients (62%) had diffuse large cell lymphoma, 18 (33%) had follicular low-grade lymphoma, one had small lymphocytic lymphoma, one had diffuse mixed cell lymphoma, and one had mantle cell lymphoma.

Using a limiting dilution method, a mu-producing cell clone FL-318M, and gamma-producing FL-318G were isolated. Hybridization studies with various DNA probes from the IGH locus as well as the BCL2 gene demonstrated that the mu-constant gene was deleted on the functional IGH allele of FL-318G cells, and that the cells produced abundant productive gamma-chain messages.

CNTF is a survival promoting factor for various types of neurons in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, structural features essential for the biological function of human CNTF were investigated. Several recombinant CNTF variants were constructed by PCR and expressed in E. coli. Their survival promoting activities were determined using cultures of embryonic chick and newborn rat dorsal root ganglion cells. Deletion of 14 N-terminal and 18 C-terminal amino acids significantly increased bioactivity compared to wild-type (wt) CNTF. Further truncation of the CNTF molecule at the N- or C-terminus resulted in a significant reduction or complete loss of activity. Substitution of two amino acids (Lys154Glu and Trp157Pro) abolished the survival promoting effect. Recently described analogous substitutions in IL-6 had resulted in a partial IL-6 receptor antagonist. However, the double substitution variant had no significant inhibitory effect on wtCNTF activity in assays with both wt and mutant factor. The CNTF variants constructed had almost identical effects on both chick and rat neurons indicating a close similarity of the avian and the mammalian CNTF receptor complex. The present results also demonstrate that a core segment of the CNTF molecule is indispensable for biological function. Analogous segments important for activity have already been identified in the related molecules IL-6, LIF, and OSM. Thus, our data confirm the close structural relationship of CNTF to these ""neuropoietic"" cytokines. In addition, they demonstrate that site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant human CNTF can yield molecules which show increased survival promoting activity on mammalian neurons.","['Thier, M', 'Simon, R', 'Kruttgen, A', 'Rose-John, S', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Schroder, J M', 'Weis, J']","['Thier M', 'Simon R', 'Kruttgen A', 'Rose-John S', 'Heinrich PC', 'Schroder JM', 'Weis J']","['Institute of Neuropathology, Technical University (RWTH), Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nerve Growth Factors/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Rats', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490400614 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1995 Apr 15;40(6):826-35. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490400614.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to estimate the age-specific incidence rates of NHL among HTLV-I-infected and HTLV-I-uninfected adults in Jamaica and Trinidad. METHODS: Population rates of HTLV-I infection were calculated from available census reports and serosurvey data. Incidence rates for NHL were calculated from all incident cases in Jamaica during 1984-1987 (n = 135) and from all incident cases in Trinidad during 1986-1990 (n = 117). Using biopsy material, we determined whether the immunophenotype of the tumor cells was T cell, B cell, or other. NHL incidence rates were computed according to HTLV-I status, age, sex, and tumor phenotype for each country separately and for both countries combined by weighting to the relative population size of each country. RESULTS: The age-standardized NHL incidence rate (mean +/- SE) in Jamaica was 1.9 +/- 0.2 per 100,000 person-years (PY). In Trinidad, the rate was 2.9 +/- 0.4 per 100,000 PY. Overall, the incidence of NHL increased with age and was higher in males than in females. In the HTLV-I-infected population, the incidence of NHL was inversely related to age, and age-specific rates were higher in males than in females. The NHL incidence in those estimated to have acquired HTLV-I infection in childhood, however, showed no sex difference, and one in 1300 such carriers (95% confidence interval: one in 1100 to one in 1600) per annum were estimated to be at such risk. For T-cell NHL, as proxy for adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, incidence was highest in those patients infected with HTLV-I early in life (perinatally or via breast milk), with high, sustained risk from early adulthood in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: While overall NHL incidence rates reveal that HTLV-I endemicity does not impose an exaggerated lymphoma burden on these populations, the risk for lymphoma among carriers who acquire infection early in life is dramatic and is consistent with the hypothesis that virus exposure early in life is most important for lymphoma-genesis. IMPLICATIONS: Studies of HTLV-I carriers known to be infected in childhood may provide insight into markers intermediate in the lympho-magnetic process. Strategies to disrupt early-life transmission of HTLV-I, notably mother-infant transmission, may be critical in reducing the burden of lymphoreticular disease in these populations.","['Cleghorn, F R', 'Manns, A', 'Falk, R', 'Hartge, P', 'Hanchard, B', 'Jack, N', 'Williams, E', 'Jaffe, E', 'White, F', 'Bartholomew, C']","['Cleghorn FR', 'Manns A', 'Falk R', 'Hartge P', 'Hanchard B', 'Jack N', 'Williams E', 'Jaffe E', 'White F', 'Bartholomew C', 'et al.']","['Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Jamaica/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Sex Distribution', 'Trinidad and Tobago/epidemiology']",1995/07/05 00:00,1995/07/05 00:01,['1995/07/05 00:00'],"['1995/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.13.1009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Jul 5;87(13):1009-14. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.13.1009.,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Jul 5;87(13):947-9.

These compounds were designed to undergo intracellular release of the phosphoramidate anions, which it was hoped would function as irreversible inhibitors of thymidylate synthase. The expectation was that binding of the nucleoside moiety would be followed by alkylation of the enzyme via the phosphoramidate. The chloride, bromide, iodide, and tosylate analogs were highly potent inhibitors of L1210 cell proliferation, with increased inhibition observed at both higher drug concentrations and longer exposure times. Addition of thymidine completely reversed the inhibition for all compounds, suggesting that these compounds are acting via inhibition of thymidylate synthase. Although the nonalkylating morpholine analog 1f was ca. 50-fold less potent than the methyl(chloroethyl)amino compound, the piperidine analog 1g was only 2-fold less potent, confirming that nitrogen basicity may be as important as the presence of an alkylating group. Addition of thymidine reversed the growth inhibition of the morpholine and piperidine analogs, suggesting that these compounds may also undergo intracellular conversion to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'monophosphate. The thymidine and deoxyuridine derivatives 2 and 3 showed minimal growth inhibition in the L1210 assay. The alkylating analogs showed modest cytotoxicity against B16 melanoma cells, and the potency of the analogs was more dependent upon the alkylating moiety than on the 5-substituent.","['Fries, K M', 'Joswig, C', 'Borch, R F']","['Fries KM', 'Joswig C', 'Borch RF']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '9Q189608GB (phosphoramidic acid)']",IM,"['Amides/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Floxuridine/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoric Acids/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/07 00:00,1995/07/07 00:01,['1995/07/07 00:00'],"['1995/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00014a019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1995 Jul 7;38(14):2672-80. doi: 10.1021/jm00014a019.,,,"['CA34619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01614/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of pro-IL-1 processing, antisense technology was employed with 16-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide directed against human IL-1 beta converting enzyme (ICR) in 7 randomly selected AML cases. The addition of 10-75 microM of antisense oligonucleotide (but not of control oligonucleotide) significantly inhibited spontaneous proliferation of bone marrow- (BM) and peripheral blood- (PB) derived low density leukemic cells in a dose-dependent way. Similarly, spontaneous as well as induced CFU-AML colony formation was inhibited by human ICE antisense oligonucleotide with sample-to-sample variability. In separate experiments, in order to examine the effects of blockade of endogenously produced IL-1 to IL-1 receptors, the functional activity of human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was tested. Continuous exposure to high concentrations of IL-1ra (up to 100 micrograms/ml) produced dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous proliferation of the BM-derived blast cells from 9 of the 14 patients and of the PB-derived cells from 10 of the 14 patients. However, in some of these patients, the lower IL-1ra doses (down to 100 ng/ml) induced potentiation of spontaneous proliferation, suggesting a novel regulatory pathway for IL-1 receptor engagement.

CD3 zeta stable transfectants of Abelson-murine leukemia virus-transformed p161+/Fc epsilon RI+ mast cells continued to express Fc epsilon RI.

METHODS: The proliferation and survival of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) activated B cells from B-CLL (n = 12) and normal peripheral blood (n = 5) were studied in vitro in response to IL-1, IL-2 IL-4, and IL-5. Survival of cells in cultures with or without added interleukins was studied by microscopic examination of cells and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Proliferation was observed in both B-CLL and normal peripheral blood cells on culture with IL-2 alone and also in some, but not all, B-CLL and normal peripheral blood cells with IL-1 and IL-4. However, there was greater variability in B-CLL cell responses than in normal peripheral blood cells. Il-5 did not affect normal peripheral blood cell proliferation but it increased proliferation in two B-CLL cases. Synergistic effects of these cytokines were not detected. IL-4 inhibited normal peripheral blood and B-CLL cell proliferation after the addition of IL-2. Inhibition of B-CLL cell responses to IL-2 was also observed with IL-5 and Il-1. Survival of B-CLL cells in cultures was enhanced with IL-4 not by an increase in proliferation but by reduced apoptosis. No such effect was seen in normal peripheral blood cells.

METHODS: FSC/SSC patterns were established upon taking into account the localisation of the residual T lymphocytes in the FSC/SSC dot plot as an internal biological standard. One hundred and seventy one newly diagnosed AML patients were analysed and five different FSC/SSC patterns were established. These five patterns could be grouped into two major categories taking into account the FSC/SSC distribution of normal cells in a bone marrow aspirate: immature patterns (1 and 2) and mature patterns (3, 4, and 5). These FSC/SSC patterns were correlated with different clinical and biological characteristics of AML patients. RESULTS: No significant associations were detected in relation to the clinical and haematological disease characteristics and the prognosis of these patients. By contrast there was a significant correlation between the FSC/SSC pattern of the AML blast cells and the FAB classification. An increased reactivity for the antigens associated with myeloid differentiation such as CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD15, CD14, CD4, CD56, and/or CD16 was detected among cases showing a mature FSC/SSC pattern (3, 4, and 5), both in the whole series and even within each of the FAB AML subtypes. By contrast, the reactivity for the CD34 precursor cell associated antigen was higher among those cases displaying an immature FSC/SSC pattern, this being observed even within each FAB subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The FSC/SSC pattern distribution of AML blast cells not only provides an additional objective and reproductible system for the classification of these leukaemias but it may also represent a connection between the FAB morphological groups and the immunophenotypic classification of AML patients.","['Vidriales, M B', 'Orfao, A', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Lopez-Macedo, A', 'Garcia, M A', 'Galende, J', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Vidriales MB', 'Orfao A', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Gonzalez M', 'Lopez-Macedo A', 'Garcia MA', 'Galende J', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Vincente, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/classification/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood', 'Light', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Scattering, Radiation']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.48.5.456 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1995 May;48(5):456-62. doi: 10.1136/jcp.48.5.456.,,,,,,,PMC502623,,,,,,,

By contrast, relatively little is known about the immunoreactivity of hemopoietic cells with antibodies that detect nonhemopoietic antigens.

Thirteen of the antibodies applied (KL1; BMA 120; and antibodies against epithelial membrane antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, prostate-specific acid phosphatase, prostate-specific epithelial antigen, placental alkaline phosphatase, alpha-amylase, serotonin, bombesin, beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin, desmin, and S-100 protein) did not stain blast cells in any of the cases. However, anti-vimentin, HMB45, and anti-myoglobin stained blast cells in the majority of the cases; the antibodies against thyroglobulin, actin, and carcinoembryonic antigen stained blast cells in 10% to 25% of the cases; and anti-neuron-specific enolase stained blast cells in less than 10% of the cases. No correlation was found between the leukemia subtype and the pattern of immunoreactivity. The staining specificity, (i.e., the specificity of binding of the primary antibody--immunologic vs. nonimmunologic binding), was tested by increasing the dilution of the primary antibody and comparing the staining intensity in the bone marrow specimens and control tissue. Staining specificity was confirmed only for staining with the antibodies against neuron-specific enolase and vimentin. The findings show that immunoreactivity of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy specimens for nonhemopoietic antigens does not exclude a diagnosis of acute leukemia.","['Ruck, P', 'Horny, H P', 'Greschniok, A', 'Wehrmann, M', 'Kaiserling, E']","['Ruck P', 'Horny HP', 'Greschniok A', 'Wehrmann M', 'Kaiserling E']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,['0 (Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1995;9(1):49-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemiluminescence and superoxide anion generation after f-MLP stimulation were found to be significantly lower than in normal subjects, whereas values within the normal ranges were registered after PMA stimulation. Phagocytosis-associated chemiluminescence was found to be impaired both by using zymosan opsonized with autologous plasma and zymosan opsonized with normal plasma, despite a normal phagocytic activity.

Genes differentially expressed in FeLV-induced lymphomas were isolated using a strategy of differential hybridization. Six genes were identified which demonstrate a higher level of expression in an FeLV-induced feline thymic tumor as compared with normal thymus. The differentially expressed genes encode the feline homologues of ribosomal proteins S3a, S4, S17, and L41, elongation factor-1 alpha, and cytochrome oxidase sub-unit I. Northern-blot analysis and quantification by phosphorimaging demonstrates that these genes are expressed at levels from 1.5- to 3.1-fold higher in J5-1 thymic tumor as compared with normal thymus. Expression of the selected ribosomal protein mRNA was further examined in a series of human and feline tissues, including normal tissues, malignant tumors and cell lines. Our data reveal that elevation of the selected ribosomal protein mRNA is associated with all FeLV-induced thymic lymphomas examined. The differentially expressed ribosomal protein mRNA accumulates in a balanced manner in thymic lymphomas. By contrast, the elevation in ribosomal protein mRNA levels is not associated uniformly with hematopoietic malignancy. T-lymphoid malignancy, solid tumors or actively proliferating cells. Rather, the elevation appears to be a uniform and distinctive feature of T-cell malignancy of this particular type. The elevated expression of these genes may be causally related to the neoplastic process.","['Starkey, C R', 'Levy, L S']","['Starkey CR', 'Levy LS']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cats', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Male', '*Oncogenes', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/28 00:00,1995/07/28 00:01,['1995/07/28 00:00'],"['1995/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910620316 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Jul 28;62(3):325-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910620316.,,,['CA-48801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['TU-11', 'fte-1', 'rpL41', 'rpS3a', 'v-fos']",,,,,,,,,,

Verapamil was able to completely restore doxorubicin accumulation in the resistant cells to the level obtained in sensitive cells, but only partially reversed doxorubicin resistance. Quinine, in contrast, had a relatively weak effect on doxorubicin accumulation but was able to completely restore doxorubicin sensitivity in the resistant cells. In addition, verapamil was able to decrease azidopine binding to P-glycoprotein, whereas quinine was not. Quinine also modified the intracellular tolerance to doxorubicin, which suggests that it is able to modify drug distribution within the cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that verapamil and quinine were able to restore nuclear fluorescence staining of doxorubicin in resistant cells; since this was obtained for quinine without significant increase of doxorubicin accumulation, this observation confirms that quinine acts principally on doxorubicin redistribution within the cells, allowing the drug to reach its nuclear targets. When used in association, verapamil and quinine reversed doxorubicin resistance in a synergistic fashion. We conclude that verapamil and quinine do not share the same targets for reversal of MDR in this cell line; whereas verapamil directly interferes with P-glycoprotein and mainly governs drug accumulation, quinine has essentially intracellular targets involved in drug redistribution from sequestration compartments.","['Bennis, S', 'Ichas, F', 'Robert, J']","['Bennis S', 'Ichas F', 'Robert J']","['Institut Bergonie, Universite de Bordeaux II, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '63XR70204A (azidopine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Azides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dihydropyridines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phenotype', 'Quinine/*pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1995/07/28 00:00,1995/07/28 00:01,['1995/07/28 00:00'],"['1995/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910620309 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Jul 28;62(3):283-90. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910620309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using immunocytochemical methods, 63 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at onset and 10 relapses were studied to investigate Bcl-2 expression and any possible correlations with subtypes of the FAB classification, sex, age or white cell peripheral blood count at onset. RESULTS: Bcl-2 is present in 87.3% of AML cases at onset and in 100% of relapses. In 68.3% of cases at onset and in 90% of relapses the protein is present in more than 20% of the blasts. Relapses always show higher percentages of positive expression than those seen at onset. Our results demonstrate no statistical correlations between the expression of the oncoprotein Bcl-2 and FAB subtypes, sex, age, or white cell peripheral blood count. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of blasts from AML patients express the oncoprotein Bcl-2, which is able to protect leukemic cells from apoptosis.

Indeed, systematic studies of natural history and prognostic factors have made it possible to predict the outcome of disease. Although clinical stage (i.e. Rai and Binet stages) is the strongest predictor of survival, additional prognostic parameters, including patterns of bone marrow (BM) infiltration, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), immunophenotype and cytogenetics, have now been identified. Furthermore, criteria of smoldering CLL (i.e. stage A, low lymphocyte count, non-diffuse BM histology, relatively high hemoglobin level, LDT > 12 months) allow identification of a subgroup of patients with indolent course and good prognosis for whom treatment should be delayed, unless progression occurs. Recent meta-analysis of clinical trials has demonstrated no survival advantage for immediate versus referred treatment in low clinical stages. The same considerations apply when comparing combination versus single-drug regimens. Purine analogues like fludarabine, 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxycoformicin are active in CLL. Data on these drugs come from uncontrolled clinical trials; randomized studies are in progress. In addition, some issues concerning the relationship between response and survival, cross-resistance between purine analogues and eradication of the CLL clone, remain still unresolved. There are also increasing data on bone marrow transplants in CLL, although the high treatment-related mortality suggests that this procedure may have some benefit only in selected refractory young CLL patients with adverse features. This review will focus on recent progress in the prognosis and therapy of CLL.

Several studies have highlighted the clinical relevance of PML/RAR alpha detection, which provides a specific diagnosis, prognostic information, and prediction of relapse when monitoring residual disease during the follow-up. In fact, this hybrid gene is detected in 100% of APLs. Rare cases of patients with a morphological diagnosis of FAB M3 AML who lack the specific PML/RAR alpha abnormality have been reported as being unresponsive to differentiation treatment.

Thus, RT-PCR of the hybrid PML/RAR alpha gene is currently performed prospectively as part of cooperative clinical trials aimed at better addressing post-remission treatment in APL.","['Diverio, D', 'Riccioni, R', 'Mandelli, F', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Diverio D', 'Riccioni R', 'Mandelli F', 'Lo Coco F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 Mar-Apr;80(2):155-60.,,,,"['PML', 'RAR&agr;']",,59,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over the last ten years, 29 AML patients received unpurged autologous bone marrow (BM) after a conditioning regimen including Ara-C (3 g/m2/12h, days -9, -8), CTX (60 mg/kg/day, days -6, -5) and TBI (3.33 Gy/day, days -3 through -1). In 21 patients, ABMT was performed as late intensification after first CR. Eight more relapsing patients were autografted after the achievement of second CR. RESULTS: Three patients died from transplant-related complications. In the remaining patients, mean times to WBC and platelet recovery were, respectively, 23 days (range 13-55) and 55 days (range 22-790). Follow-up for censored patients ranged from 1 to 120 months. Relapse occurred in 7 patients (5 in first and 2 in second CR). Overall 5-year DFS and event-free survival (EFS) chances were, respectively, 67.3% and 60%, with no statistically significant differences between first (DFS = 67.3%, EFS = 60.3%) and second CR (DFS = 68.6%, EFS = 60%). DISCUSSION: Apart from obvious selection biases, our study suggests that outcome in first CR AML patients is improved by ABMT. Long-term DFS and EFS are clearly better than when conventional post-remission chemotherapies are used. The greater antileukemic potential of ABMT is further underlined by the results in patients autografted in second CR, when conventional chemotherapy is almost never curative.","['Lambertenghi Deliliers, G', 'Annaloro, C', 'Della Volpe, A', 'Oriani, A', 'Mozzana, R', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Tagliaferri, E', 'Soligo, D']","['Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Annaloro C', 'Della Volpe A', 'Oriani A', 'Mozzana R', 'Pozzoli E', 'Tagliaferri E', 'Soligo D']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, I.R.C.C.S.

We wanted to evaluate the outcome of intensive chemotherapy and the influence of recent therapy changes in underprivileged patients treated in a large urban public university hospital. METHODS: The records of all patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia from 1980 to 1993 were analyzed. RESULTS: 109 patients were identified; 41 did not receive any treatment for the leukemia because of infectious and/or hemorrhagic complications of advanced disease. Median survival in this group was 4 days. The other 68 patients received one of two induction protocols: TAD from 1980 to 1985 (n = 23) and ara-C plus daunorubicin from 1985 to 1992 (n = 45). The complete remission rate was 56%, disease-free survival 24% and overall survival 15% at 13 years. Overall survival was better for patients treated with ara-C plus daunorubicin than with TAD (19% versus 8%, p = 0.01). This is attributed to a reduction in infection mortality after ceftazidime and amikacin replaced cephalotin, carbenicillin and amikacin as the antibiotic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective intervention in our population would probably be an improvement in the primary health care system, so that earlier diagnosis could allow the treatment of a larger fraction of patients.","['Pulcheri, W', 'Spector, N', 'Nucci, M', 'de Morais, J C', 'Pimenta, G', 'de Oliveira, H P']","['Pulcheri W', 'Spector N', 'Nucci M', 'de Morais JC', 'Pimenta G', 'de Oliveira HP']","['Hematology Service, University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '0O54ZQ14I9 (Aminoglutethimide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'G42ZU72N5G (Carbenicillin)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)', 'R72LW146E6 (Cephalothin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'TAD protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/therapeutic use', 'Aminoglutethimide/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Transfusion', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Carbenicillin/therapeutic use', 'Ceftazidime/therapeutic use', 'Cephalothin/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Danazol/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Health Care', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tamoxifen/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 Mar-Apr;80(2):130-5.,,,,,,35,,,,,,,,

In this study we used 31D8 mAb to determine whether differences in neutrophil subpopulations might explain the long-lasting decreased chemotaxis observed in bone marrow transplant recipients. METHODS: Thirty patients with self-sustaining hematopoiesis 1 to 5 years bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (15 allogeneic and 15 autologous) performed for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, 10 patients) or acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission (8 patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma (2 patients), chronic myeloid leukemia (8 patients) and severe aplastic anemia (2 patients) were included in the study. Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay and 31D8 binding was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis. RESULTS: Neutrophil chemotaxis was significantly impaired in the BMT group with respect to controls. The chemotactic defect strikingly correlated with autologous BMT and, in particular, with ALL as the pre-existing disease. No differences between patients and controls were observed in the percentage of 31D8 bright and dull neutrophils. However, when mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was analyzed as a relative measure of 31D8 antigen expression on the overall neutrophil population, a significant decrease was observed in neutrophils from BMT patients with respect to controls. As for chemotaxis, the impairment of 31D8 binding was more evident in autologous BMT and strikingly correlated with ALL as the pre-existing disease regardless of age, sex and time since BMT. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between impaired chemotaxis and decreased 31D8 binding was found in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the decreased neutrophil chemotaxis observed in some BMT patients may be due in part to circulating 31D8 dull neutrophils, although the causes for the decreased 31D8 binding and for the quite pronounced neutrophil defect in ALL patients remain unknown.","['Capsoni, F', 'Minonzio, F', 'Carbonelli, V', 'Ongari, A M', 'Mocellin, M C', 'Soligo, D', 'Annaloro, C', 'Della Volpe, A', 'Lambertenghi Dliliers, G']","['Capsoni F', 'Minonzio F', 'Carbonelli V', 'Ongari AM', 'Mocellin MC', 'Soligo D', 'Annaloro C', 'Della Volpe A', 'Lambertenghi Dliliers G']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Immunopathology, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*etiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 Mar-Apr;80(2):123-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that [d]-alpha-tocopherylquinone (alpha-TQ), [d]-delta-tocopherylquinone (delta-TQ), and [d]-gamma-tocopherylquinone (gamma-TQ) are antioxidants at low concentrations and prooxidants at high concentrations in the model system. Prooxidant activity is greater with gamma-TQ than either alpha-TQ or delta-TQ. Low concentrations of alpha-TQ, delta-TQ, and gamma-TQ are also antioxidants in SMC cultures challenged with AA. Unlike alpha-TQ, partially substituted gamma-TQ and glutathione (GSH) form a Michael adduct which has been purified and characterized. We found previously that alpha-T, gamma-T, and alpha-TQ are mitogenic in SMC. We now report that both delta-TQ and gamma-TQ but not alpha-TQ show concentration-dependent cytotoxicity (changes in morphology, propidium iodide stain) in SMC cultures. Cytotoxicity is greater with gamma-TQ than delta-TQ. An acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line shows greater chemosensitivity (MTT and Neutral Red assays) to gamma-TQ than to either doxorubicin (DOX) or vinblastine (VLB). An ALL cell line resistant to both DOX and VLB retains the same chemosensitivity to gamma-TQ as the drug-sensitive ALL cell line. ALL cell lines are unaffected by either alpha-TQ or the GSH Michael adduct of gamma-TQ. These data show that partially substituted tocopheryl quinones capable of forming Michael adducts are potential chemotherapeutic agents for multidrug-resistant cancer cells.","['Thornton, D E', 'Jones, K H', 'Jiang, Z', 'Zhang, H', 'Liu, G', 'Cornwell, D G']","['Thornton DE', 'Jones KH', 'Jiang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Liu G', 'Cornwell DG']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Quinones)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '7559-04-8 (tocopherylquinone)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PG7JD54X4I (cumene hydroperoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Benzene Derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['089158499400210B [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(94)00210-b [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1995 Jun;18(6):963-76. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(94)00210-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PE2 value was significantly higher in patients with RL than in patients with CR (p < 0.00375).

However, relatively little is known regarding the regulatory mechanism of IL-1 production in ATL. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) affects the monocytes- and neoplastic cells-mediated cytokine production. In this study, we investigated the effect of IL-4 on IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta production by ATL cells in vitro. IL-4 was found to markedly inhibit the release of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta into the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis of steady-state IL-1 mRNA demonstrated that IL-4 treatment of ATL cells resulted in a reduction of IL-1 mRNA. These results support the notion that ATL cells spontaneously produce IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta; however, such production can be inhibited by the immunomodulating agent, IL-4.

There was no difference between the rates of proliferation from primary cultures of SJL/J and Balb/c mice measured at 48 h in response to a range of concentrations of PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, TGF beta 1, or LIF (added at 24 h). SJL/J primary cultures were more responsive to bFGF (which was the most potent mitogen) than were BALB/c cultures. Comparison of dose response curves to bFGF and TGF beta 1 grown on gelatin or Matrigel showed that the nature of the ECM did not have a significant affect. More myotubes formed at 4 days in SJL/J than in parallel BALB/c cultures on gelatin or Matrigel (P < 0.05). On gelatin more myotubes with 4 or more nuclei were formed in cultures from SJL/J than BALB/c muscles (P < 0.05); however, on Matrigel these myotubes occurred with similar frequency. Myotube formation examined in BALB/c muscle cultures grown on collagen i.v., entactin-free laminin, and fibronectin showed that none of these ECM components alone supported large myotube formation (4 or more nuclei) as well as did Matrigel, although fibronectin was as effective as Matrigel with respect to the total number of myotubes formed. Parallel experiments carried out using the myogenic H-2Kb(27) cell line showed similar effects with the exception of laminin which enhanced large myotube formation and desmin expression in the H-2Kb(27) but not in the primary muscle cultures. The greater sensitivity in mitogenic response to bFGF and the more extensive myotube formation seen in SJL/J compared with BALB/c cultures in vitro reflects the superior capacity for muscle regeneration of SJL/J mice in vivo.","['Maley, M A', 'Davies, M J', 'Grounds, M D']","['Maley MA', 'Davies MJ', 'Grounds MD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gelatin/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Laminin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/pharmacology', 'Species Specificity', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71217-7 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1217 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Jul;219(1):169-79. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is in contrast to the more diffuse nucleolar distribution of the rev-encoded protein (Rev) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the functional homologue to Rex, in HIV-1-infected cells. Accumulation of Rev is associated with disruption of nucleolar structure and cell death, whereas Rex does not have these effects.

Studies on the induction of the enzyme by hypotonic stress.,40-4,"One of the cellular responses to hypotonic stress is a marked induction of a key regulatory enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, i.e. ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). This increase in ODC activity appears to be a physiological response since the elevated putrescine production seen after the hypotonic shock renders the cells less sensitive to the decrease in osmolarity. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which the hypotonicity may induce ODC activity. We provide support for a translational mechanism, closely related to the polyamine-mediated feedback regulation of ODC synthesis. In addition, we have examined whether the long G+C-rich 5' untranslated region of the ODC mRNA, which has been demonstrated to negatively affect the translatability of the message, is of any importance for the induction of ODC by hypotonic stress. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing ODC mRNA, with or without the 5' untranslated region, were isolated after transfecting ODC-deficient CHO cells with the appropriate constructs. Hypotonic treatment of the stable transfectants, however, revealed no major difference in ODC induction between the cells expressing a full-length ODC mRNA and those expressing an ODC mRNA deleted of its 5' untranslated region, demonstrating that this part of the message was not essential for the osmotic effects on ODC expression.","['Lovkvist-Wallstrom, E', 'Stjernborg-Ulvsback, L', 'Scheffler, I E', 'Persson, L']","['Lovkvist-Wallstrom E', 'Stjernborg-Ulvsback L', 'Scheffler IE', 'Persson L']","['Department of Physiology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Jul 1;231(1):40-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that circulating factors of maternal or fetal origin may protect against tumor growth during pregnancy. The previously created experimental model of teratomas provides the means of having an adult animal bearing a permanent graft of embryonal tissues. To investigate the potential effects of embryonal factors on the growth of malignant neoplasms, rats carrying grafts of embryonal tissues were subjected to the induction or transplantation of carcinomas and lymphomas. Finely minced embryo tissues or cell suspensions injected in homologous rat recipients formed permanent benign teratomas composed of a variety of well differentiated tissues. One injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, a potent carcinogen administered to all rats, induced fatal mammary adenocarcinoma in 50-60% of control rats but in none of the rats bearing a grafted teratoma. Transplantation of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary adenocarcinoma or Gross virus-induced lymphoma killed 100% of control rats but resulted in smaller, later appearing tumors in only 25-61% of teratoma-bearing rats. The present experiments showed that rats bearing grafts of embryonal tissues in the form of teratomas were partially or totally protected against the induction and transplantation of malignant tumors that killed 100% of controls. These results suggest that the embryonal tissues are a source of tumor-inhibitory factors, which may be a part of mechanisms controlling the growth and detecting the aberrations of embryonal tissues. Their identification and analysis may provide knowledge about embryonal growth and possibly about new substances with antineoplastic activity.","['Moroson, H', 'Ioachim, H L']","['Moroson H', 'Ioachim HL']","['Department of Pathology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/prevention & control', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Teratoma/*pathology']",1995/08/15 00:00,1995/08/15 00:01,['1995/08/15 00:00'],"['1995/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Aug 15;55(16):3664-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the use of ELISA, IL-8 protein was also detected in the culture medium of these cells and in the extracellular fluids of patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the HTLV-I-derived transactivator protein, tax, could stimulate endogenous IL-8 gene expression in an uninfected T-cell line (Jurkat) and in a rheumatoid synovial cell line (E-11). Induction of IL-8 by tax at protein level was also demonstrated in transfected cells. We found that the IL-8 NF-kappa B-binding site specifically formed a complex with NF-kappa B-containing nuclear extracts from HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and freshly isolated leukemic cells from adult T-cell leukemia patients. Finally, transfection of HTLV-I tax into Jurkat cells resulted in induction of specific binding of nuclear extracts to the NF-kappa B sequence.

In the present study, we isolated two overlapping genomic DNA clones (termed c13S25) containing the D13S25 DNA segment and used them as probes to analyze 85 B-CLL cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization; of the 55 cases with two RB-1 copies, 13 exhibited hemizygous (n = 7) or homozygous (n = 6) deletion of D13S25. Of 29 cases with hemizygous deletion of RB-1, all but two also showed loss of D13S25 (hemizygous, n = 25; homozygous, n = 2). One case had a homozygous deletion of both loci. We conclude that deletion of D13S25 occurs in a substantial number of B-CLL without deletion of RB-1. However, in some cases there is deletion of RB-1 without loss of D13S25, suggesting that D13S25 is not the locus of the putative tumor suppressor gene. According to our data, such a gene is most likely located within the genomic region between D13S25 and RB-1.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Leupolt, E', 'Ohl, S', 'Weiss, G', 'Schroder, M', 'Fischer, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Leupolt E', 'Ohl S', 'Weiss G', 'Schroder M', 'Fischer K', 'Bentz M', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V.

A comparison with G-banding and chromosome painting.,9-16,"Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) represents a new technique for global analysis of a whole genome for net loss or gain of chromosome regions. It offers several advantages over alternative techniques. It permits analysis of a whole genome in a single hybridization reaction, it does not require the generation of metaphases from tumor cells, and it only requires very small numbers of tumor cells. Most previous studies have concentrated on the application of CGH to the analysis of chromosome defects associated with solid tumors. In this paper we report the use of CGH to study bone marrow samples from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and complex karyotypic abnormalities. The results obtained using CGH were compared with G-banding analysis. Both G-banding and CGH detected a 5q deletion, a 7q deletion, additional material derived from 8q, and an HSR on 11q. However, several apparently discrepant results were also obtained. Paints for chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 22, and X were therefore used to resolve these differences. Our results demonstrate that CGH detected chromosome abnormalities associated with acute myeloid leukemia and that CGH provided information that was not obtained by G-banding analysis alone. These data suggest that CGH may prove a useful adjunct to conventional cytogenetic and molecular analysis of hematologic malignancies.","['Nacheva, E', 'Grace, C', 'Holloway, T L', 'Green, A R']","['Nacheva E', 'Grace C', 'Holloway TL', 'Green AR']","[""Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Hospital, Department of Haematology, Cambridge, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(94)00286-K [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(94)00286-k [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1995 Jul 1;82(1):9-16. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(94)00286-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that this gene mutation may be less frequent in myeloid leukemia patients than in myeloid leukemia cells lines and that the latter acquire these mutations during growth in vitro. We investigated this possibility by studying p53 gene alterations in matched samples of fresh leukemic cells and their respective derivative cell lines obtained from two CML blast crisis and one AML patient. No gross structural abnormalities were detected in the p53 gene in any of the samples analyzed. Discrete mutations in the gene in the two CML blast crisis samples and in all three derivative cell lines were, however, detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses and DNA sequencing. Cytogenetic analyses revealed either numerical or structural, as well as numerical, abnormalities of chromosome 17 in their karyotypes. Cells from the two CML blast crisis patients had two different mutations which were maintained as the sole mutations in the cell lines. The mutation detected in the AML cell line was, however, not detectable in the parental fresh leukemic cells. Our findings demonstrate that p53 mutations and chromosome 17 abnormalities occurring in CML blast crisis patients persist in long-term cell lines but that mutations not detectable in AML patients may indeed be acquired in cell lines established from them in vitro.","['Sen, S', 'Zhou, H', 'Andersson, B S', 'Cork, A', 'Freireich, E J', 'Stass, S A']","['Sen S', 'Zhou H', 'Andersson BS', 'Cork A', 'Freireich EJ', 'Stass SA']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016546089400282G [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(94)00282-g [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1995 Jul 1;82(1):35-40. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(94)00282-g.,,,['RR5511/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],['p53'],,,,,,,,,,

We have examined potential p53-mediated effects of metabolically labeling cultured mammalian cells with [35S]methionine and [3H]thymidine, methods that are commonly used to study the biochemical properties, synthesis, processing and degradation of proteins and the replication of DNA in proliferating cells. RESULTS: Wild-type p53 protein concentrations rapidly increased to high levels following metabolic radiolabeling of cells, as determined by four distinct assays. The increased concentration of wild-type p53 resulted in apoptosis of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and of murine T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. In leukemia cells containing no p53, or only mutant p53 alleles, p53 protein levels were not increased and the cells did not undergo apoptosis in response to radioactive labeling. Radiolabeling of human diploid fibroblasts resulted in a prolonged growth arrest that was maintained for nearly three weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The results of experiments employing radiolabeling techniques to characterize various aspects of cellular physiology may be seriously influenced by the induction of aberrant cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis mediated by wild-type p53. Furthermore, our observations suggest that stabilization of wild-type p53 in response to irradiation may not act primarily to facilitate the repair of DNA damage by inducing a transient G1-phase arrest, but rather to ensure genetic stability through sustained cell-cycle arrest or apoptotic death of the damaged cells.","['Yeargin, J', 'Haas, M']","['Yeargin J', 'Haas M']","['Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Division/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Isotope Labeling', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/*pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism/*radiation effects']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(95)00083-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00083-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 1995 Apr 1;5(4):423-31. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00083-2.,,,['R01CA56075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution of the magnetic field inside and outside vertebral bodies containing paramagnetic substances was systematically studied for phantoms and by measurements in vivo. Nineteen healthy volunteers and 26 patients with alterations of the bone marrow due to hematologic disease were examined. The amount of paramagnetic substances in the marrow was estimated by measuring steps of Larmor frequency of the water resonances at the transition between vertebral bodies and adjacent intervertebral disks. These frequency steps were exhibited by MAGSUS imaging on a 1.5 Tesla whole-body imager. Additional volume-localized 1H spectroscopy allowed a more quantitative assessment of the spectral components. The measured frequency steps of the water resonances ranged between 0 and 26 Hz for the healthy volunteers examined. In contrast, patients with pathologically altered marrow and high amount of paramagnetic substances revealed frequency steps of up to 85 Hz. The frequency steps in 8 patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with slow reconstitution (mean 48.9 Hz, standard deviation (s.d.) 21.7 Hz) were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than in normal volunteers.

The results were used to show the importance of taking specificity of disease into consideration in causation analysis. METHODS: Data were derived from a cohort of workers employed at two Goodyear plants in Ohio in the manufacture of Pliofilm. Based on data in the Pliofilm study, several papers that examined the relation between exposure to benzene and leukaemia (all cell types combined) have been published. In the current analyses based on updated data in the study, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for AML and multiple myeloma by cumulative exposure to benzene. The results based on AML were compared with those for leukaemia (all cell types combined) published previously. RESULTS: An exposure response relation was shown between cumulative exposure to benzene and AML. No increased risk of AML was detected for cumulative exposure to benzene below 200 ppm-years (SMR 0.91). Above 200 ppm-years, risk of AML rose drastically; reaching a significant SMR of 98.37 for > 400 ppm-years. For multiple myeloma, no relation with exposure to benzene was detected. CONCLUSION: Analysis specific to AML shows the importance of taking specificity of disease into consideration in causation analysis. This investigation shows that previous analyses based on all leukaemia cell types combined have incorrectly set the estimated threshold too low, and have underestimated risk above the threshold. Current regulatory policies that rely on previous analyses based on all leukaemia cell types combined should be re-examined.","['Wong, O']",['Wong O'],"['Applied Health Sciences, San Mateo, California 94401, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Multiple Myeloma/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.52.6.380 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1995 Jun;52(6):380-4. doi: 10.1136/oem.52.6.380.,,['Occup Environ Med. 1996 May;53(5):357-8.

METHODS: Occupational histories and other data were collected by personal interview on 164 NHLs, 23 CLLs, diagnosed in 1988-90, and on 977 controls. This paper only reports the results of the analysis relative to the coding of job titles through the modified International Labour Office (ILO) classification. Estimates of odds ratios (ORs) for occupational variables were calculated, after adjustment for sex, age, altitude of municipality, first degree familiarity, and previous Herpes zoster infection. RESULTS: From the analysis of the most frequent occupational categories, no occupation showed a significantly high risk. When the two job titles farmers only and farmer-breeders who are also involved in animal breeding are classified within the extremely varied occupation of agriculture or animal-breeding or fishing, a high risk for NHLs and CLLs is seen in the farmer-breeders (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22 - 2.63). Analyses according to histological type show that the risks are concentrated in CLLs and in low grade NHLs. No effect or trend by period at work or duration of employment in farming and animal breeding was found. CONCLUSION: Subjects working in agriculture associated with animal breeding are at high risk of NHL/CLLs, particularly CLLs and low grade NHLs.

The cytotoxicity of Ara-C derives from an inhibition of DNA synthesis which can be determined using flow cytometry from the amount of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporated into cells after a short exposure to BrdUrd. We developed a computer program to quantify inhibition of the rate of DNA synthesis by analysis of the distribution of BrdUrd/DNA. A resistance index (RI) was expressed as the ratio of the amount of BrdUrd incorporated into S phase cells incubated with Ara-C to that incorporated in the absence of Ara-C. In Ara-C sensitive and resistant HL60 cell lines, a linear relationship between RI and log Ara-C concentration was observed.

A flow cytometric assay.,329-36,"Nucleolin and fibrillarin are two histone-like major proteins in the nucleolus that were found to be overexpressed in proliferating cells. Using specific antibodies to either nucleolin or fibrillarin flow cytometric, measurements were carried out to demonstrate quantitative changes of these proteins during lymphocyte mitogenic activation and differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells. The expression of nucleolin increased during lymphocyte stimulation and decreased slowly but constantly in the course of differentiation of HL-60 cells. Expression of fibrillarin reached a maximum in the first cell cycle and then dropped to a basic level in stimulated lymphocytes. Compared to nucleolin, the level of fibrillarin decreased more rapidly and more extensively in differentiating HL-60 cells. The data support other observations that nucleolin is a stabile structural protein at the ribosomal genes while fibrillarin may have a more specific functional role in nucleologenesis and ribosome production.","['Mehes, G', 'Pajor, L']","['Mehes G', 'Pajor L']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (fibrillarin)', '0 (nucleolin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1995.tb00074.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1995 Jun;28(6):329-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1995.tb00074.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show with a deletion from nucleotides 290-299 in PSI RNA transcripts and through an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 275-291 that the 283-298 region is involved in RNA dimer formation in vitro. In an attempt to further characterize the mechanism of dimer formation, a series of short RNA transcripts was synthesized which overlapps the PSI region of MoMuLV RNA. The dimerization of these RNAs is temperature dependent. The predicted secondary structure of the 278-303 region, as a function of temperature, reveals that this sequence is able to adopt two conformations: (1) the U288 AGCUA293 sequence in a loop; (2) part of the same nucleotides implicated in a stem. These results, together with thermodynamic analysis, strongly suggest that (1) the loop conformation of the UAGCUA sequence modulates the relative amount of RNA dimer and (2) a 16 bp long Watson-Crick base pairing is involved in RNA dimer formation. We propose that loop-loop recognition via the U288 AGCUA293 sequence leads to a stable structure induced by a stem-loop opening. Furthermore, our results do not support purine quartet formation as necessary for the dimerization of the 5' leader MoMuLV RNA.","['Girard, P M', 'Bonnet-Mathoniere, B', 'Muriaux, D', 'Paoletti, J']","['Girard PM', 'Bonnet-Mathoniere B', 'Muriaux D', 'Paoletti J']","['Unite de Biochimie, URA 147 CNRS, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Deletion', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Thermodynamics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00030a016 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Aug 1;34(30):9785-94. doi: 10.1021/bi00030a016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now examined in detail inhibition by spongistatin 1 of both [3H]vinblastine and [3H]dolastatin 10 binding to tubulin. We found spongistatin 1 to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of both radiolabeled drugs to tubulin, in contrast to competitive patterns obtained with vincristine versus [3H]vinblastine and with a chiral isomer of dolastatin 10 versus [3H]dolastatin 10. Since dolastatin 10 is itself a noncompetitive inhibitor of vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin, this implies at least three distinct binding sites for the structurally complex and diverse natural products that interfere with each others binding to tubulin and with nucleotide exchange. Spongistatin 1, in contrast to both vinca alkaloids and peptide antimitotic agents like dolastatin 10, does not induce formation of a GTP-independent, morphologically distinctive polymer (""aggregate""). We also examined eight compounds closely related structurally to spongistatin 1 (spongistatins 2-9). The most distinctive in their properties were spongistatins 6 and 8. These two compounds, despite activity comparable to spongistatin 1 as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and [3H]vinblastine binding, had much reduced activity as inhibitors of nucleotide exchange and [3H]dolastatin 10 binding. Spongistatins 1 and 6 were compared for effects on dolastatin 10-induced aggregate formation in conjunction with effects on [3H]dolastatin 10 binding. Spongistatin 6 was about 4-fold less active than spongistatin 1 as an inhibitor of aggregation and over 20-fold less active as an inhibitor of dolastatin 10 binding.","['Bai, R', 'Taylor, G F', 'Cichacz, Z A', 'Herald, C L', 'Kepler, J A', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai R', 'Taylor GF', 'Cichacz ZA', 'Herald CL', 'Kepler JA', 'Pettit GR', 'Hamel E']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '0 (spongistatin 6)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '148179-94-6 (spongistatin 1)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Depsipeptides', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', '*Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tubulin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00030a009 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Aug 1;34(30):9714-21. doi: 10.1021/bi00030a009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A murine IL-3 cDNA was introduced into the parental NFS60-17 cells that was exclusively dependent on IL-3. We analyzed the glycosphingolipids from the parental cells and the transfected cells by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analyses and/or immunostaining techniques using specific antibodies. Two major gangliosides, IV3NeuAc-GgOse4Cer (GM1b) and IV3-NeuAc,III6NeuAc-GgOse4Cer (GD1 alpha), were expressed, in the parental cells. By contrast, in the IL-3 gene-transfected cells, a ganglioside IV3NeuAc,II3NeuAc-GgOse4Cer (GD1a) was strikingly expressed, in addition to GM1b and GD1 alpha that were already present in the parental cells. In spite of various IL-3-secreting capabilities, all transfectants investigated have exhibited the same ganglioside patterns and expressed GD1a. Furthermore, the appearance of GD1a was a consequence of the up-regulation of a single glycosyltransferase, CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide alpha 2-->3-sialytransferase (GM3 synthase). Activities of the other downstream glycosyltransferases that were involved in GD1a synthesis were not significantly different between the parental and the transfected cells. According to these data, the progression of tumor stage by the acquisition of autonomous cell growth ability after IL-3 gene transfection resulted in dramatic changes in cell surface gangliosides and their biosynthetic pathways. GD1a could be considered as an IL-3-associated ganglioside and was expressed in a tight connection with a single glycosyltransferase (GM3 synthase) up-regulation and with IL-3 expression in murine myelogenous leukemia cells.","['Tsunoda, A', 'Nakamura, M', 'Kirito, K', 'Hara, K', 'Saito, M']","['Tsunoda A', 'Nakamura M', 'Kirito K', 'Hara K', 'Saito M']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Institute of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.9 (haematoside synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Base Sequence', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA Primers', 'Gangliosides/analysis/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/25 00:00,1995/07/25 00:01,['1995/07/25 00:00'],"['1995/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00029a011 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Jul 25;34(29):9356-67. doi: 10.1021/bi00029a011.,,,,,,,,,,,['Biochemistry 1995 Nov 7;34(44):14616'],,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and retinoic acid (all trans or 9-cis) on proliferation and cell differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, and to test the reversibility of the induced differentiation. Cell proliferation was inhibited as expected by 1,25(OH)2D3 and all trans retinoic acid alone (IC50 of cell survival was 4 x 10(-7) M, 9 x 10(-6) M and 9 x 10(-7) M for 1,25(OH)2D3, all trans and 9-cis retinoic acid, respectively). Combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and either form of retinoic acid resulted in a partially additive decrease in cell proliferation. 1,25(OH)2D3 induced a monocytic differentiation (100% CD14+ cells with 10(-7) M 1,25(OH)2D3), while retinoic acid led to a predominantly granulocytic differentiation (36 and 42% CD67+ cells with 10(-6) M all trans and 9-cis retinoic acid, respectively). Additive effects on differentiation were observed upon combination of subtherapeutical doses of the drugs, achieving a mainly monocytic population, demonstrating the dominant role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in determining the direction of differentiation. The effects on proliferation and differentiation of the solitary drugs were reversible, while the proliferation arrest and differentiation induced by the combination persisted and even progressed after withdrawal of the drugs. We conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 and retinoic acid (all trans or 9-cis) exert additive effects on inhibition of proliferation and induction of cell differentiation of HL60 cells, leading to a persistent differentiation, even after drug withdrawal.","['Verstuyf, A', 'Mathieu, C', 'Verlinden, L', 'Waer, M', 'Tan, B K', 'Bouillon, R']","['Verstuyf A', 'Mathieu C', 'Verlinden L', 'Waer M', 'Tan BK', 'Bouillon R']","['Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO) U.Z.

The most extreme variations included having completed the family before diagnosis but still having another child versus not having completed the family before diagnosis but refraining from further progeny. More than half of the affected families refrained from having further offspring, delineating psychological motives for their decision. For parents whose family planning is affected by their experiences with childhood leukemia, the decision-making process is an extra burden.

Farnesol (20 microM) reduced the rate of radioactive label incorporation into cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphocholine, the products of degradation of phosphatidylcholine (PC), indicating inhibition of PC-specific phospholipase C after about 1 h of incubation. Inhibition of phospholipase D by farnesol at the later incubation time (about 2 h) was demonstrated by a decrease in synthesis of PC-derived phosphatidylethanol in the presence of ethanol. These effects of farnesol on PC degradation and formation of DAG were followed by apoptotic fragmentation of cellular DNA and inhibition of cell growth. Exogenous DAG reduced the level of DNA fragmentation and cell growth inhibition. Results are consistent with the involvement of cellular signal transduction in the mechanism of inhibition of cell proliferation by farnesol.","['Voziyan, P A', 'Haug, J S', 'Melnykovych, G']","['Voziyan PA', 'Haug JS', 'Melnykovych G']","['Department of Microbiology, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City 66160-7420, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '4602-84-0 (Farnesol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Choline/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Farnesol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1995/07/17 00:00,1995/07/17 00:01,['1995/07/17 00:00'],"['1995/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(85)71995-X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1995.1995 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1995 Jul 17;212(2):479-86. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1995.1995.,,,['CA08315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

An increase in DEX-repressed c-myc mRNA levels precedes the recovery of cell growth. A threshold level of Myc expression appears to be required to maintain growth and viability of C7 cells.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of locally identified patients and analysis of cases from the medical literature. PATIENTS: The records of all patients with isolated chloroma identified at three teaching hospitals in Toronto between 1980 and 1994 were reviewed. A MEDLINE search was done to identify all cases of isolated chloroma reported in the English-language medical literature. Patients with a previous known hematologic disorder were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: The effect of therapy on 1) the interval between diagnosis of chloroma and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and 2) survival was determined. RESULTS: 7 local patients and 83 published cases were identified, for a total of 90 evaluable patients. For the entire group, the median time to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was 9 months, and median survival was 22 months. Chemotherapy was administered to 49 patients (54%) at diagnosis of chloroma. Significantly fewer patients treated with chemotherapy subsequently developed acute myeloid leukemia (41% compared with 71%; P = 0.001). Survival was longer in patients treated with chemotherapy (> 50% alive with a median follow-up of 25 months compared with a median survival of 13 months for those initially untreated; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that neither local radiotherapy nor surgery had an effect on survival.

However, significant complications are associated with this procedure including the development of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). Treatment for this condition requires chronic immunosuppression which can lead to the development of second cancers. It is well known that immunosuppression is associated with a variety of tumors, most commonly lymphoma. The development of solid tumors appears to be less common but follow-up studies of patients treated for Hodgkin's disease demonstrate a rising incidence of solid tumor development after a delay of 5 to 10 years. We describe a patient recently treated for a squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus which developed 5 years after an allogeneic BMT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The patient had been treated with immunosuppressants for chronic GVHD. The clinical course is described and the literature is reviewed regarding recent experience with the development of solid tumors following allogeneic BMT. The majority of second tumors following BMT are lymphomas and leukemias. Secondary solid tumors are less common, but the incidence appears to increase over time. Squamous carcinomas are most common and a preparative regimen combining radiation and chemotherapy may increase risk.

RDCs containing apo A1 and proapo A1 were both effective in the mobilization of intracellular cholesterol, whether this was measured by intracellular cholesterol mass or by the appearance of radiolabelled cholesterol in the supernatant. Using the radiolabelling technique, the activity was saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

For RDCs of proapo A1 and apo A1 and for native HDL the Km values were 3.7, 2.9 and 64.8 micrograms ml-1 respectively. A significant in vitro cholesterol efflux could only be achieved with protein-lipid complexes; no significant export was observed with either free proapo A1 or multilamellar PC liposomes without apolipoprotein. Both RDCs were found to be more active in the mobilization of intracellular cholesterol than HDL isolated from human plasma.

Together with earlier studies, these results suggest that enhancers act to affect a binary (on/off) switch in transcriptional activity. Although this idea challenges the widely accepted model of enhancer activity, it is consistent with much, if not all, experimental evidence on this subject. We hypothesize that enhancers act to increase the probability of forming a stably active template.

Receptor dimerization in turn activates receptor-associated kinases of the Jak/Tyk family, resulting in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, including those of two members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family--STAT1 and STAT3. Here we show that all cytokines that utilize gp130 sequentially induce two distinct forms of STAT3 in all responding cells examined, with the two forms apparently differing because of a time-dependent secondary serine/threonine phosphorylation involving an H7-sensitive kinase. While both STAT3 forms bind DNA and translocate to the nucleus, the striking time-dependent progression from one form to the other implies other important functional differences between the two forms. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which utilizes a receptor highly related to gp130, also induces these two forms of STAT3. In contrast to a number of other cytokines and growth factors, all cytokines using gp130 and related signal transducers consistently and preferentially induce the two forms of STAT3 as compared with STAT1; this characteristic STAT activation pattern is seen regardless of which Jak/Tyk kinases are used in a particular response, consistent with the notion that the receptor components themselves are the primary determinants of which STATs are activated.","['Boulton, T G', 'Zhong, Z', 'Wen, Z', 'Darnell, J E Jr', 'Stahl, N', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Boulton TG', 'Zhong Z', 'Wen Z', 'Darnell JE Jr', 'Stahl N', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",1995/07/18 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/07/18 00:00'],"['1995/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.15.6915 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Jul 18;92(15):6915-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.15.6915.,,,,,,,PMC41441,,,,,,,

Murine bone marrow cells were transduced by each of the recombinant viruses and subsequently used to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated recipients. Five to seven months after transplantation, analysis of the peripheral blood of animals transplanted with cells transduced by vectors which employ viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) for gene expression indicated that in 83% (77/93) of these animals, the level of human enzyme was equal to or greater than the level of endogenous murine enzyme. Even in bone marrow transplant recipients reconstituted for over 1 year, significant levels of gene expression were observed for each of the vectors in their bone marrow, spleen, macrophages, and B and T lymphocytes. However, derivatives of the parental MFG-ADA vector which possess either a single base mutation (termed B2 mutation) or myeloproliferative sarcoma virus LTRs rather than the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTRs led to significantly improved gene expression in all lineages.

Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the transmission properties of a large number of different recombinant proviral genomes which vary both in the precise nature of vector, beta-globin structural gene, and locus control region (LCR) core sequences incorporated and in the placement and orientation of those sequences. Through this analysis, we identified one specific vector, termed M beta 6L, which carries both the human beta-globin gene and core elements HS2, HS3, and HS4 from the LCR and faithfully transmits recombinant proviral sequences to cells with titers greater than 10(6) per ml. Populations of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells transduced by this virus expressed levels of human beta-globin transcript which, on a per gene copy basis, were 78% of the levels detected in an MEL-derived cell line, Hu11, which carries human chromosome 11, the site of the beta-globin locus. Analysis of individual transduced MEL cell clones, however, indicated that, while expression was detected in every clone tested (n = 17), the levels of human beta-globin treatment varied between 4% and 146% of the levels in Hu11. This clonal variation in expression levels suggests that small beta-globin LCR sequences may not provide for as strict chromosomal position-independent expression of beta-globin as previously suspected, at least in the context of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.","['Sadelain, M', 'Wang, C H', 'Antoniou, M', 'Grosveld, F', 'Mulligan, R C']","['Sadelain M', 'Wang CH', 'Antoniou M', 'Grosveld F', 'Mulligan RC']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02142-1479, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', '*Retroviridae', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/18 00:00,1995/07/18 00:01,['1995/07/18 00:00'],"['1995/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.15.6728 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Jul 18;92(15):6728-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.15.6728.,,,['HL37569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC41402,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded observational study in consecutive patients. SETTING: A research hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: The patients received either high-dose methotrexate 1 g/m2 intravenously over 24 hours or low-dose methotrexate 30 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses; both regimens were followed by an intensive six-drug chemotherapy regimen given over 6 weeks. Glomerular filtration rate was determined in each subject before and at the conclusion of induction therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The GFR was determined from 99mTc-DTPA serum clearance in all patients, and methotrexate clearance was estimated from serial serum concentrations in 18 of these children who received high-dose methotrexate. Median values for GFR at diagnosis (131 ml/min/1.73 m2) and after induction therapy (120 ml/min/1.73 m2) were not significantly different (p = 0.26) but were highly variable (range 49-274 ml/min/1.73 m2). Body size, age, and serum creatinine were correlated significantly with GFR at diagnosis. Amphotericin B therapy (6 patients) significantly decreased GFR (p = 0.046) without a corresponding increase in serum creatinine. Methotrexate clearance (58-155 ml/min/m2) was significantly (p = 0.007) correlated with GFR, but GFR accounted for only 37% of the variability of methotrexate clearance. CONCLUSIONS: The GFR was normal but highly variable in these children with leukemia and was significantly altered by amphotericin. Our results explain little of the intersubject variability in methotrexate clearance.","['Murry, D J', 'Synold, T W', 'Pui, C H', 'Rodman, J H']","['Murry DJ', 'Synold TW', 'Pui CH', 'Rodman JH']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', '*Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 1995 Mar-Apr;15(2):144-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ets proteins share a conserved 85 amino acids DNA binding domain, the Ets domain and recognize various DNA target sites around a common core 5'-GGAA/T-3'. The DNA binding specificities of Spi-1 and Spi-B were investigated by using the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated random site selection. The deduced Spi-1 and Spi-B consensus binding sites are very similar suggesting that the functional activities of Spi-1 and Spi-B cannot be distinguished on the basis of their DNA binding specificities. We identified a putative Spi-1/Spi-B binding site in the promoter region of the c-fes/c-fps protooncogene which encodes a tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly in myeloid cells. In vitro translated Spi-1 and Spi-B proteins were capable to bind this site similarly and to activate the c-fes promoter in HeLa transfected cells. We showed that Spi-1 binds the Spi-1/Spi-B binding site of c-fes in HL-60 cells suggesting that Spi-1 may be involved in the regulation of c-fes transcription in myeloid cells. Intriguingly, we detected only Spi-1 binding to this site in the Raji cell line which express both Spi-1 and Spi-B proteins. This suggests that Spi-1 and Spi-B exhibit different DNA binding activities in vivo although they share similar DNA binding specificities in vitro.","['Ray-Gallet, D', 'Mao, C', 'Tavitian, A', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F']","['Ray-Gallet D', 'Mao C', 'Tavitian A', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['Unite 248 INSERM, Faculte de Medecine Lariboisiere Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148350-00-9 (SPIB protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1995/07/20 00:00,1995/07/20 00:01,['1995/07/20 00:00'],"['1995/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jul 20;11(2):303-13.,,,,"['c-fes', 'c-fps', 'spi-1', 'spi-B']",,,,,,,,,,

To do this, Tax does not directly bind to the CArG box, but instead binds to the CArG binding factor SRF. In this study, we investigated the domain of SRF required for the activation by Tax and studied the role of this domain on transcriptional regulation at the CArG box. Using a fusion protein of SRF with a yeast transcription factor GAL4, the 14 amino acid (aa) portion (aa 422-435) of SRF was identified as the domain required for Tax activation [Tax-responsive region of SRF (TRRS)]. By means of a two hybrid system, we showed that TRRS was essential for the interaction of SRF with Tax in vivo. The over-expression of SRF with a deletion of TRRS inhibited the Tax activation at the CArG box. Thus, TRRS is the domain of SRF that is essential for Tax activation at the CArG box. Unlike to Tax activation, TRRS was not required for TPA (12-o-tetradecanoylphobol-13-acetate) induction at the CArG box, but a TRRS deletion enhanced the basal activity at the CArG box both under serum-starved and TPA-stimulated conditions. These results suggest that TRRS negatively regulates the transcriptional activation function of SRF, and consequently contributes to the low basal activity at the CArG box before TPA induction.","['Fujii, M', 'Chuhjo, T', 'Minamino, T', 'Masaaki, N', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Seiki, M']","['Fujii M', 'Chuhjo T', 'Minamino T', 'Masaaki N', 'Miyamoto K', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/physiology', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, fos', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1995/07/06 00:00,1995/07/06 00:01,['1995/07/06 00:00'],"['1995/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jul 6;11(1):7-14.,,,,['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,

We have analysed a translocation t(9;14)(p21-p22;q11) in a B-cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Location of the 14q11 breakpoint within the TCR-alpha/delta locus allowed the isolation of a fusion transcript composed of a 3' segment containing part of the constant region of the TCR-alpha gene and a 5' segment from chromosome 9, designated 0.18. This 0.18 segment was also part of cDNAs isolated from two tumoral B-cell lines (RPMI-8226, Raji). In both cases, 0.18 was juxtaposed 5' to a sequence corresponding to exons 2 and 3 of the p16INK4/MTS1 gene which is located on band 9p21-22. Unexpectedly, none of the two ATG codons found in 0.18 was in phase with that of the exons 2 and 3 of p16INK4/MTS1. Furthermore, in vitro translation product of a RPMI-8226 cDNA clone generated a product that was not immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific of the C-terminal end of the p16INK4/MTS1 protein. Evidence for similar transcripts in non tumoral lymphoid B cells (unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymphoblastoid cell lines) were obtained by using amplimers representative of the 0.18 segment and the p16INK4/MTS1 exon 2.

It has been reported that expression of tax induces neoplastic transformation in the rat fibroblast cell line Rat-1, and that co-expression with the ras gene can transform rat embryo fibroblasts. Possible activation of cellular oncogenes including c-myc and c-fos by tax has been implicated in these tax functions. In this study, comparative analysis of biological properties of tax and cellular nuclear oncogenes c-myc and c-fos was performed in Rat-1 cells. While all three oncogenes could transform Rat-1 cells, significant differences in the sensitivity to induction of apoptosis were observed between cells transformed with each oncogene. Induction of apoptosis by serum starvation was observed in tax-transfected Rat-1 cells but to a lesser extent than that in those transfected with c-myc or c-fos. In contrast, exposure to a DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, resulted in enhanced apoptotic death only in c-myc-transfected Rat-1 cells. Our findings indicate that the pathways for apoptosis induction may not be identical among these three oncogenes, and that the relatively low apoptosis-inducing activity and sufficient transforming capacity of tax might be associated with transformation of T cells and the low susceptibility of the transformed T cells (ATL cells) to chemotherapeutic agents.","['Fujita, M', 'Shiku, H']","['Fujita M', 'Shiku H']","['Department of Oncology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', '*Genes, fos', '*Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Rats']",1995/07/06 00:00,1995/07/06 00:01,['1995/07/06 00:00'],"['1995/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jul 6;11(1):15-20.,,,,"['c-fos', 'c-myc', 'p53', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is not normally expressed in T cells, but is expressed in erythroid, mast, megakaryocytic and progenitor cells. Over-expression of sense and antisense constructs have implicated SCL as a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation. In addition we have previously shown that SCL mRNA levels undergo biphasic modulation during induced erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells with a transient early fall followed by a late rise. In this paper we have studied expression of the SCL protein during erythroid differentiation and also the molecular basis for the raised SCL mRNA levels that accompany erythroid differentiation. We have generated an anti-SCL antiserum and used it to demonstrate that an early transient fall in SCL protein does not occur during induced differentiation of MEL cells. Furthermore SCL protein levels underwent a late fall in three different models of erythroid differentiation and in two models of myeloid differentiation. The fall in SCL protein levels during induced erythroid differentiation contrasted with the concomitant marked rise in SCL mRNA levels. These observations have significant implications for the mechanism by which SCL may regulate erythropoiesis. In addition we have demonstrated that the stability of SCL mRNA was only marginally enhanced during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells, whereas the activity of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the SCL promoter was increased 11- to 17-fold. Up-regulation of transcription therefore accounted for most of the increase in SCL mRNA levels during erythroid differentiation.","['Murrell, A M', 'Bockamp, E O', 'Gottgens, B', 'Chan, Y S', 'Cross, M A', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Green, A R']","['Murrell AM', 'Bockamp EO', 'Gottgens B', 'Chan YS', 'Cross MA', 'Heyworth CM', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1995/07/06 00:00,1995/07/06 00:01,['1995/07/06 00:00'],"['1995/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jul 6;11(1):131-9.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['SCL', 'TAL-1']",,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that a factor(s) other than p53 may be involved in differential expression of WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and MDM2 mRNA.","['Yamato, K', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Hirano, Y', 'Tsuchida, N']","['Yamato K', 'Yamamoto M', 'Hirano Y', 'Tsuchida N']","['Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Valine/*genetics']",1995/07/06 00:00,1995/07/06 00:01,['1995/07/06 00:00'],"['1995/07/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jul 6;11(1):1-6.,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,

The overall enhancer activity of the beta-globin complex LCR (beta-LCR) is dependent on the integrity of the tandem NF-E2 sites of HS-2. The NF-E2 protein which binds these sites is a heterodimeric basic leucine zipper protein composed of a tissue-specific subunit, p45 NF-E2, and a smaller subunit, p18 NF-E2, that is widely expressed. In these studies, we sought to investigate the role of NF-E2 in globin expression. We show that expression of a dominant-negative mutant p18 greatly reduces the amount of functional NF-E2 complex in the cell. Reduced levels of both alpha- and beta-globin were associated with the lower levels of NF-E2 activity in this cell line. Globin expression was fully restored upon the introduction of a tethered p45-p18 heterodimer. We also examined CB3 cells, a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line that does not express endogenous p45 NF-E2, and demonstrated that the restoration of globin gene expression was dependent upon the levels of expressed tethered NF-E2 heterodimer. Results of DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and in vivo footprinting assays showed no detectable chromatin alterations in beta-LCR HS-2 due to loss of NF-E2. Finally, we examined the specificity of NF-E2 for globin gene expression in MEL cells. These experiments indicate a critical role for the amino-terminal domain of p45 NF-E2 and show that a related protein, LCRF1, is unable to restore globin gene expression in p45 NF-E2-deficient cells. From these results, we conclude that NF-E2 is specifically required for high level goblin gene expression in MEL cells.","['Kotkow, K J', 'Orkin, S H']","['Kotkow KJ', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mafk protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'MafK Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.8.4640 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Aug;15(8):4640-7. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.8.4640.,,,,,,,PMC230705,,,,,,,

In this report, we have defined a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the 5'-flanking region of the lactoferrin gene promoter. The lactoferrin-RARE is composed of two AGGTCA-like motifs arranged as a direct repeat with 1-bp spacing (DR-1). A gel retardation assay demonstrated that it bound strongly with retinoid X receptor (RXR) homodimers and RXR-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimers as well as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) orphan receptor. In CV-1 cells, the lactoferrin-RARE linked with a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter was strongly activated by RXR homodimers in response to 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) but not to all-trans-RA. When the COUP-TF orphan receptor was cotransfected, the 9-cis-RA-induced RXR homodimer activity was strongly repressed. A unique feature of the lactoferrin-RARE is that it has an AGGTCA-like motif in common with an estrogen-responsive element (ERE). The composite RARE/ERE contributes to the functional interaction between retinoid receptors and the estrogen receptor (ER) and their ligands. In CV-1 cells, cotransfection of the retinoid and estrogen receptors led to mutual inhibition of the other's activity, while an RA-dependent inhibition of ER activity was observed in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the lactoferrin-RARE/ERE showed differential transactivation activity in different cell types. RAs could activate the lactoferrin-RARE/ERE in human leukemia HL-60 cells and U937 cells but not in human breast cancer cells. By gel retardation analyses, we demonstrated that strong binding of the endogenous COUP-TF in breast cancer cells to the composite element contributed to diminished RA response in these cells. Thus, the lactoferrin-RARE/ERE functions as a signaling switch module that mediates multihormonal responsiveness in the regulation of lactoferrin gene expression.","['Lee, M O', 'Liu, Y', 'Zhang, X K']","['Lee MO', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang XK']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (COUP Transcription Factor I)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (NR2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'COUP Transcription Factor I', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Estrogens/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.8.4194 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Aug;15(8):4194-207. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.8.4194.,,,['CA60988/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC230658,,,,,,,

One of the earliest responses to receptor stimulation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI and the association of the tyrosine kinase Syk with the phosphorylated receptor. This association is mediated by the SH2 domains of Syk and is believed to be critical for activating signaling pathways resulting in mediator release. To examine the importance of the interaction of Syk with Fc epsilon RI in signaling events following receptor activation, we introduced a protein containing the SH2 domains of Syk into streptolysin O-permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells. The Syk SH2 domains completely inhibited degranulation and leukotriene production following receptor aggregation, and they blocked the increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation observed after receptor activation. Inhibition was specific for Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, since degranulation of cells activated by alternative stimuli was not blocked by the Syk SH2 domains. A protein containing a point mutation in the carboxy-terminal SH2 domain which abolishes phosphotyrosine binding was not inhibitory. In addition, inhibition of degranulation was reversed by pretreatment of the SH2 domains with a tyrosine phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the tyrosine-based activation motif found in the gamma subunit of Fc epsilon RI, the nonphosphorylated peptide had no effect. The association of Syk with the tyrosine-phosphorylated gamma subunit of the activated receptor was blocked by the Syk SH2 domains, and deregulation in cells activated by clustering of Syk directly without Fc epsilon RI aggregation was not affected by the Syk SH2 domains. These results demonstrate that the association of Syk with the activated Fc epsilon RI is critical for both early and late events following receptor activation and confirm the key role Syk plays in signaling through the high-affinity IgE receptor.","['Taylor, J A', 'Karas, J L', 'Ram, M K', 'Green, O M', 'Seidel-Dugan, C']","['Taylor JA', 'Karas JL', 'Ram MK', 'Green OM', 'Seidel-Dugan C']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Basophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Streptolysins/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.8.4149 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Aug;15(8):4149-57. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.8.4149.,,,,,,,PMC230653,,,,,,,

Most of the actions of PTHrP have been attributed to its interaction with a specific cell surface receptor that binds the N-terminal domain of the protein. Here we present evidence that PTHrP promotes some of its cellular effects by translocating to the nucleolus. Localization of transiently expressed PTHrP to the nucleolus was dependent on the presence of a highly basic region at the carboxyl terminus of the molecule that bears homology to nucleolar targeting sequences identified within human retroviral (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1) regulatory proteins. Endogenous PTHrP also localized to the nucleolus in osseous cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, expression of PTHrP in chondrocytic cells (CFK2) delayed apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, and this effect depended on the presence of an intact nucleolar targeting signal. The present findings demonstrate a unique intracellular mode of PTHrP action and a novel mechanism by which this peptide growth factor may modulate programmed cell death.","['Henderson, J E', 'Amizuka, N', 'Warshawsky, H', 'Biasotto, D', 'Lanske, B M', 'Goltzman, D', 'Karaplis, A C']","['Henderson JE', 'Amizuka N', 'Warshawsky H', 'Biasotto D', 'Lanske BM', 'Goltzman D', 'Karaplis AC']","['Division of Endocrinology, Sir Mortimer B.

We have previously shown that the labial group protein HOXA-1 has intrinsically weak DNA-binding activity due to residues in the N-terminal arm of its homeodomain (M. L. Phelan, R. Sadoul, and M. S. Featherstone, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:5066-5075, 1994). This observation, among others, suggests that HOX and HOM proteins require cofactors for stable interactions with DNA. We have demonstrated that a putative HOX cofactor, PBX1A, participates in cooperative DNA binding with HOXA-1 and the Deformed group protein HOXD-4. Three Abdominal-B class HOX proteins failed to cooperate with PBX1A. We mapped the interacting domain of HOXD-4 to the YPWMK pentapeptide motif, a conserved sequence found N terminal to the homeodomain of HOXA-1 and many other homeoproteins but absent from the Abdominal-B class. The naturally occurring fusion of the transcriptional activation domain of E2A with PBX1 creates an oncoprotein implicated in human pre-B-cell leukemias (M. P. Kamps, C. Murre, X.-H. Sun, and D.

A pentapeptide mutation that abolished cooperative interaction with PBX1A in vitro also abrogated synergistic transcriptional activation with the E2A/PBX oncoprotein.

This study reports the identification of a major 118 kDa granulocyte surface protein, (Protein 1 a) which binds the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and is distinctly different from reported WGA binding granulocyte membrane proteins. Protein 1 a has been isolated from the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble lysates of normal individuals and patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) using a combination of differential solubilization, lectin affinity, ion exchange chromatography and HPLC. The protein from the detergent lysates of both normal and CML granulocytes has similar pI values, lectin affinities, and hydrophobicity. However, its solubility in Triton is different in the two cell types. In 71% of CML cases examined, Protein 1 a exhibits decreased Triton solubility suggesting its increased association with the cytoskeleton (CSK). Stimulation of normal granulocytes with WGA leads to the translocation of the soluble form of Protein 1 a to the Triton-insoluble fraction.

The immune system is functional in the uterus and therefore there is the potential for anti-conceptus immune responses. However, endometrial lymphocytes are distinct in many respects from lymphoid cells at peripheral sites; one major subpopulation expresses the gamma delta T-cell receptor and may not recognize major histocompatibility antigens. There are also several control systems to limit anti-conceptus immune responses. In particular, expression of major histocompatibility antigens on the trophoblast is either absent or of limited distribution. In addition, activation of anti-conceptus immune responses leading to cytolytic responses is further limited by the presence of molecules that can inhibit lymphocyte transformation. The most well-characterized of these are prostaglandin E2 from placental and endometrial tissues, interferon-tau from the trophoblast during early pregnancy, and two endometrial proteins called the uterine milk proteins (UTMP). Progesterone plays a central role in inhibition of immune responses in actions that are mediated at least in part through endometrial secretion of UTMP. Cytokines play important roles as autocrine and paracrine regulators in many tissues including the reproductive tract. In ruminants, the best described example is interferon-tau. Other cytokines found in the reproductive tract or produced by the conceptus include interleukin-1, leukaemia inhibitory factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-6. It is possible that the major source of cytokines in the reproductive tract is non-lymphoid cells of the endometrium and trophoblast. It is not known to what extent endometrial lymphocytes contribute to the cytokine milieu because no cytokine has been identified as a product of endometrial lymphocytes. However, there is a population of granulated lymphocytes that increase in number and granularity in the luminal epithelium of the late-pregnant ewe that is a potential source of cytokines.","['Hansen, P J']",['Hansen PJ'],"['Department of Dairy and Poultry Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611-0920, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,J Reprod Fertil Suppl,Journal of reproduction and fertility.

PLZF is highly conserved throughout evolution from yeast to mammals. To elucidate its role, we isolated the murine PLZF gene and studied its expression during embryogenesis. PLZF is expressed in an extremely dynamic pattern with transcripts appearing at E 7.5 in the anterior neuroepithelium and quickly spreading to the entire neuroectoderm until E 10. At E 8.5, PLZF is transcribed in most of the endoderm. During mid to late gestation PLZF is expressed in restricted domains of the developing CNS as well as in specific organs and body structures. We have focused our attention on the developing forebrain where PLZF is transcribed in a transverse, segment-like domain corresponding to the anterior pretectum, in the alarmost part of the dorsal thalamus, in the epithalamus, and in the hypothalamus along a defined longitudinal subdomain. Furthermore, PLZF is expressed in several segmentary boundaries, among them, the zona limitans intrathalamica. Combined analysis with other regionally restricted genes, such as Orthopedia and Dlx1, indicates that in the hypothalamus the PLZF domain is contained within that of Orthopedia and both are complementary to that of Dlx1. Our data suggest a role for PLZF in the establishment and maintenance of transverse identities, longitudinal subdomains, and interneuromeric boundaries, providing additional evidences in favor of the neuromeric organization of the forebrain.","['Avantaggiato, V', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Hawe, N', 'Acampora, D', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Simeone, A']","['Avantaggiato V', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Ruthardt M', 'Hawe N', 'Acampora D', 'Pelicci PG', 'Simeone A']","['International Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Embryonic and Fetal Development', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Mice', '*Models, Neurological', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Prosencephalon/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1995 Jul;15(7 Pt 1):4927-42.,,,['E.0015/Telethon/Italy'],,,,PMC6577856,,,,,,,

Therefore, T1-weighted imaging showed the marrow of the mandible to have a high signal intensity similar to that of fat in the control cases. In contrast, the bone marrow of the mandible in the patients exhibited lower intensity than that of fat and was enhanced after Gd-DTPA injection. CONCLUSION: In hematologic diseases MRI detected the signal changes of the mandible. More attention should be focused on the marrow intensity of the mandible in the routine cranial MR examinations in patients with hematologic disorders.","['Amano, Y', 'Wakabayashi, H', 'Kumazaki, T']","['Amano Y', 'Wakabayashi H', 'Kumazaki T']","['Department of Radiology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Gadolinium', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mandible/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Pentetic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004728-199507000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 1995 Jul-Aug;19(4):552-4. doi: 10.1097/00004728-199507000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect immunocytofluorescence using affinity-purified PKC-specific antibodies indicates that each of the endogenous PKC isozymes in U937 cells display a unique compartmentalization within the intact cell. PKC-beta 1 is distributed between two identifiable pools: a cytoplasmic pool which redistributes to the plasma membrane upon activation with acute phorbol ester-treatment, and a membrane-bound pool associated with intracellular vesicles containing beta 2-integrin adhesion molecules, cd11b and cd11c. The vesicle-associated PKC-beta 1 translocates with the secretory granules to the plasma membrane upon agonist-stimulated activation. PKC-beta 2 is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton in resting cells. PKC overlay assays indicate that PKC-beta 2 binds to proteins associated with microtubules, and not directly to tubulin. PKC-epsilon is associated with filamentous structures in resting cells and redistributes to the perinuclear region upon activation with phorbol esters. In differentiated U937 cells, PKC-beta 1 remains associated with vesicles translocating from the trans-Golgi region to the plasma membrane and PKC-epsilon is primarily associated with perinuclear and plasma membranes. PKC-zeta, which does not respond to phorbol ester treatment, is primarily cytosolic in undifferentiated cells and accumulates in the nucleus of differentiated cells blocked in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The data clearly demonstrate that individual PKCs localize to different subcellular compartments and promote the hypothesis that PKC subcellular localization is indicative of unique functions for individual PKC isozymes.","['Kiley, S C', 'Parker, P J']","['Kiley SC', 'Parker PJ']","['Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'CD11 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/immunology/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1995 Mar;108 ( Pt 3):1003-16.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the effects of substituting Gln for Glu199 of the human C5a receptor (hC5aR) expressed in a model cell system for chemoattractant receptor signaling, the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. Both the binding affinity for hC5a and the EC50 for subsequent cellular signals are reduced 5-10-fold by this substitution. A peptide mimic of the C terminus of C5a also binds to, and activates, hC5aR. The response to this peptide is reduced in cells bearing mutated hC5aR, indicating that the mutation affects interactions with the C terminus of hC5a. The C-terminal peptide contains only two basic residues, a Lys and an Arg (assumed to be analogous to Lys68 and Arg74 of hC5a), which could act as counter-ions for Glu199 of the receptor. If the counter-ion on hC5a was Arg74, then it would be expected that intact hC5a and hC5a des-Arg74 would have identical affinities and potencies when interacting with mutant hC5aR. It was found, however, that the binding affinity and potency (for receptor signaling events) of hC5a des-Arg74 was always lower than for intact hC5a. Furthermore, the equivalent C-terminal peptide to hC5a des-Arg74 (i.e. lacking the C-terminal Arg) could partially activate the wild type but not the mutant receptor, whereas the converse peptide, containing Arg but containing Met instead of Lys, had equal potencies for both wild type and mutant receptors. Taken together these data indicate that Glu199 of hC5aR is not involved in an interaction with Arg74 of hC5a, but may interact with Lys68 of hC5a. Mutation of Glu199 defines a second ligand binding site on hC5aR, distinct from the previously characterized site on the receptor N terminus. Unlike the N-terminal binding site, this second site is associated not just with the interaction with hC5a, but also with receptor activation.","['Monk, P N', 'Barker, M D', 'Partridge, L J', 'Pease, J E']","['Monk PN', 'Barker MD', 'Partridge LJ', 'Pease JE']","['Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/14 00:00,1995/07/14 00:01,['1995/07/14 00:00'],"['1995/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.28.16625 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)46886-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul 14;270(28):16625-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.28.16625.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of biotinylated MRK16 (b-MRK16) and SA-RED670 resulted in higher sensitivity as compared with standard methods such as the use of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) conjugate. The sensitivity was examined in K562, K562/ADR, NOMO-1, NOMO-1/ADR and HL60 cells, and compared with the data obtained from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of mdr-1 gene. P-gp positivity on flow cytometry was 10.4%, 99.9%, 1.4%, 90.4% and 0%, respectively. Mdr-1 mRNA was well expressed in K562/ADR and NOMO-1/ADR cells, but not in NOMO-1 and HL60 cells. In K562 cells, mdr-1 was found after 40 cycles of PCR, but not 25 cycles. These data are well correlated with those from the flow cytometry. We then studied the P-gp expression on normal peripheral blood cells and acute leukemia cells. P-gp was little expressed on peripheral lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. It was also little expressed on blast cells from 5 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML) and 5 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) expressed P-gp at diagnosis, ranging from 8.5% to 34.5% (16.9 +/- 11.8%) and from 2.3% to 45.6% (24.0 +/- 17.8%), respectively.

Tumor cell products with activity to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were shown to play an important role in the development of the cancer cachexia syndrome. All culture media conditioned by the 5 cell lines possessed LPL-inhibitory activity. However, the activity differed with the cell line. In order to characterize the activity, we examined whether the cultured cells produced cytokines with activity to inhibit LPL. A melanoma cell line, SEKI, and a neuroepithelioma cell line, NAGAI, were found to express a large amount of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA. Furthermore, both of these cell lines were demonstrated to produce a large amount of LIF protein, and plasma levels of LIF were extremely elevated in SEKI- and NAGAI-bearing nude mice, indicating that LIF produced by the tumor cells induced cancer cachexia syndrome in the animals. Thus, LIF fulfills the requirements for a toxohormone, except for suppressive activity on liver catalase. In contrast, the mechanisms responsible for cachexia in the MKN-1-, LX-1- and LS180-bearing mice remain unknown.

Recent significant therapeutic improvements obtained by entrapping anthracyclines in sterically stabilized liposomes raised the question whether the therapeutic index of vincristine can be similarly increased by formulation into such long-circulating liposomes. Encapsulation of vincristine in sterically stabilized liposomes (SL-VCR) prolonged the drug's distribution phase plasma half-life in rats from 0.22 to 10.5 hr. There was no significant difference in LD50 (> < or = 2.5 mg/kg, i.v.), but mice given sublethal doses of SL-VCR experienced significantly less weight loss than those given the same dose of free drug. Compared to free drug, SL-VCR was most effective against i.p. or s.c. implanted tumors. However, i.v. tumor inoculation nullified the therapeutic advantage of encapsulation. A single i.v. 2 mg/kg dose of SL-VCR increased the life span of mice bearing i.v. implanted P388 cells by only 44%, while the life span of i.p. P388 implanted mice was increased by 199%. In an s.c. implanted murine colon carcinoma, multiple doses of free drug did little to slow the growth of the tumors, but SL-VCR was able to produce long-term survivors in several dose regimens. These results indicate that prolonged circulation time increases the therapeutic index of VCR entrapped in liposomes against s.c. or i.p. implanted tumors, but does not improve the drug's activity against rapidly growing i.v. disseminated leukemias.","['Allen, T M', 'Newman, M S', 'Woodle, M C', 'Mayhew, E', 'Uster, P S']","['Allen TM', 'Newman MS', 'Woodle MC', 'Mayhew E', 'Uster PS']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",1995/07/17 00:00,1995/07/17 00:01,['1995/07/17 00:00'],"['1995/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910620215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Jul 17;62(2):199-204. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910620215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CTX injections on days 7, 14 and 21 resulted in a significant anti-tumor response in mice transplanted s.c. with Friend leukemia cells or ESb cells, whereas no anti-tumor effect was observed in mice injected with Eb or p11-R-Eb cells. All 4 tumor cell lines were equally sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of mafosfamide, an in vitro active analogue of CTX. To define the host mechanisms responsible for the lack of an anti-tumor effect of CTX in mice transplanted with IL-2-responsive tumors, we studied several aspects of the spontaneous or IL-2-induced anti-tumor response in mice transplanted with p11-R-Eb cells. Injection of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to IFN-gamma completely abolished the anti-tumor effects of IL-2. Using a Winn assay, clear-cut anti-tumor activity was found in spleen cells from mice transplanted with the IL-2-responsive tumors. This activity was abolished by CTX, which also abrogated the anti-tumor response to IL-2 in mice injected with p11-R-Eb cells.

A similar increase in IL-2R alpha by TG was also observed in human peripheral T cells. Further, like PMA, TG markedly induced NF kappa B in Jurkat T cells. However, TG and PMA exhibited a synergistic action on IL-2R alpha expression, suggesting that TG and PMA induce IL-2R alpha through distinct pathways. PMA- but not TG-induced IL-2R alpha is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor H7, whereas TG- but not PMA-induced IL-2R alpha was inhibited by cholera toxin, forskolin and 1,9-dideoxy forskolin.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was comprised of 226 patients with MDS diagnosed in accordance with the FAB criteria and followed up in our department between January 1975 and April 1992. The following MDS subtypes were found: refractory anaemia (RA), 59 cases; refractory sideroblastic anaemia (RSA), 49 cases; refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 56 cases; RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) 48 cases; and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 14 cases. The following scoring systems were applied: Mufti's 1985, Varela's 1985, Sanz's 1989, Rubio's 1991 and Aul's 1992. The statistical analysis was performed according to Kaplan-Meier actuarial systems and the log-rank test of survival. RESULTS: (1) Three groups (A, B and C) can be defined by Mufti's system, with median survival of 54.0, 16.0 and 8.5 months, respectively. The majority of cases (138) were included in group B. Group A did not reach 25 per cent of actuarial survival probability, whereas groups B and C did at 31.1 and 12.2 months, respectively. With regard to the morphologic subtypes, RA and RSA were included in groups A and B, and RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML pertained mostly to group C. Sixty-six cases (33.6 per cent) developed into acute leukemia (AL) corresponding to those last groups. (2) The three groups defined by Varela's system (0-1, 2-5 and 6 or more) had median survival of 91.8, 24 and 13 months, respectively. As in the former system, group 0-1 did not reach 25 per cent actuarial probability, this appearing at 60 and 20 months, respectively, in groups 2-5 and > 6. The distribution of the cytological varieties, RA and RSA among the groups is heterogenous although they were more common within the cases included in groups 0-1. All cases developing AL were included in the groups 2-5 and > 6. (3) The three groups of the system proposed by Sanz (0-1, 2-3 and 4-5) had median survival of, 55.3, 15 and 12.6 months respectively. As in the preceding cases, group 0-1 did not reach the 25 per cent actuarial probability, while this figure appeared at 28.2 months for group 2-3 and at 19.3 months for group 4-5. RA and RSA varieties were included chiefly in group 0-1, while RAEB and RAEB-T appear mostly in groups 2-3 and 4-5. The distribution of the cases and the evolution of AL was heterogeneous according to this system, although they predominate in groups 2-3 and 4-5. (4) Using the Aul's system, three groups A, B and C were defined. The median survival time was 14 months for group C and 24 months for group B. For group A, the median survival was not reached. RA and RSA were exclusive for group A, while RAEB and RAEB-T varieties were outstanding in group C. Regarding the evolution to leukemia the differences observed had no statistical relevance. (5) Three prognostic groups were defined by Rubio's system (namely 0-2.5, 3-5.5, > or = 6) with median survival of 53.3, 16.8 and 10.5 months, respectively. A striking difference was seen when studying the cumulated survival observed, in each of the three percentages considered, between the groups. The different cytological varieties were reasonably distributed with higher incidence of RA and RSA in group I and RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML in group III. This system offers statistical significance when comparing RA with RSA, RAEB with RAEB-T and, obviously RA+RSA with RAEB+RAEB-T+CMML. The evolution into AL also showed statistical significance with respect to the three groups.","['Rubio-Felix, D', 'Giraldo, P', 'Franco, E', 'Gimeno, J', 'Giralt, M']","['Rubio-Felix D', 'Giraldo P', 'Franco E', 'Gimeno J', 'Giralt M']","['Servicio de Hematologia-Hemoterapia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900130304 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1995 May-Jun;13(3):139-52. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900130304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral isolates with high replicative capacity in natural targets (e.g. CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) can infect other cell types [e.g. CD- astrocytes, follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in vivo and/or CD4+ neoplastic T cells in vitro] as well. These viral isolates may have a potential of infecting heterologous cells in vitro and can enlarge their host-range by establishing infection in other species, distantly related. Strains of avian sarcoma/leukemia viruses (ASLV) originating from their natural hosts, chickens, and infectious for other avian species, ducks, can frequently infect mammals (rodents). Similarly, HIV-1 strains infectious for chimpanzees possess capacity of establishing chronic infection in pig-tailed macaques.

The function of this family of molecules is poorly understood, but based on monoclonal antibody studies there is some evidence that they may be involved in transmembrane signal transduction and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, or both, in a number of different cell types. CD53 is a member of this family that is expressed on leukocytes, and transduces activation signals through unknown mechanisms that may involve phosphorylation events. However, CD53 has never been shown to associate directly with kinases. Here, we show by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates of lymph nodes and a thymoma cell line, that immune complexes of rat CD53 contain tyrosine phosphatase activity. The CD53-associated phosphatase was able to dephosphorylate in vitro the phosphorylated tyrosine kinase Lck, as well as a synthetic substrate, and its activity was abrogated by a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Although its identity has not been established, it is clear from depletion experiments that it is not CD45. CD63, a second member of the TM4SF, also co-precipitates a phosphatase activity from rat basophilic leukemia cells. These results demonstrate that the TM4SF members associate with tyrosine phosphatases. It seems possible that such associated phosphatases may contribute to the signal transduction capacity of TM4SF molecules.","['Carmo, A M', 'Wright, M D']","['Carmo AM', 'Wright MD']","['MRC Cellular Immunology Unit, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, GB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Cd53 protein, rat)', '0 (Cd63 protein, rat)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 25)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tetraspanin 25', 'Tetraspanin 30', 'Thymoma/chemistry']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830250743 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Jul;25(7):2090-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830250743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At high concentrations, CNTF can also activate the LIFR and possibly other cross-reactive cytokine receptors in the absence of CNTFR alpha. To gain a better understanding of its structure-function relationships and to develop analogs with increased receptor specificity, the cytokine was submitted to affinity maturation using phage display technology. Variants with greatly increased CNTFR alpha affinity were selected from a phage-displayed library of CNTF variants carrying random amino acid substitutions in the putative D helix. Selected variants contained substitutions of the wild-type Gln167 residue, either alone or in combination with neighboring mutations. These results provide evidence for an important functional role of the mutagenized region in CNTFR alpha binding. Affinity enhancing mutations conferred to CNTF increased potency to trigger biological effects mediated by CNTFR alpha and enhanced neurotrophic activity on chicken ciliary neurons. In contrast, the same mutations did not potentiate the CNTFR alpha-independent receptor actions of CNTF. These CNTF analogs thus represent receptor-specific superagonists, which should help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic actions of the neurocytokine.","['Saggio, I', 'Gloaguen, I', 'Poiana, G', 'Laufer, R']","['Saggio I', 'Gloaguen I', 'Poiana G', 'Laufer R']","['Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare P.

Clinical application of this approach is attractive because access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space is relatively noninvasive and distribution of producer cells and vectors may be facilitated by circulation of CSF, overcoming distribution problems inherent in solid tumors. However, meningeal inflammation, transduction and injury to normal CNS tissue, proliferation of the xenogeneic producer cells in the subarachnoid space, immune-mediated injury, and development of hydrocephalus are possible complications of intraventricular or intrathecal administration of vector-producer cells. In addition, the dynamics of producer cell and vector distribution in the CSF are unknown. To address these issues, we evaluated the safety of this approach for gene delivery and assessed the dynamics of distribution of producer cells and retroviral vectors in rats and non-human primates. In rats, transduction of normal central nervous system (CNS) structures surrounding the subarachnoid space was evaluated after intrathecal and intraventricular injections of beta-galactosidase and HStk vector-producer cells, with and without GCV. In primates, beta-galactosidase and HStk vector-producer cells were injected intraventricularly and GCV was administered either intrathecally or intravenously. Toxicity was evaluated by neurologic examination, serial gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans of the brain, and blood and CSF profiles. A subgroup of monkeys received repeated intraventricular injection of vector-producer cells and intravenous GCV. The titer of retroviral-vector was measured in cisternal and lumbar CSF samples after repeated producer cell injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Oshiro, E M', 'Viola, J J', 'Oldfield, E H', 'Walbridge, S', 'Bacher, J', 'Frank, J A', 'Blaese, R M', 'Ram, Z']","['Oshiro EM', 'Viola JJ', 'Oldfield EH', 'Walbridge S', 'Bacher J', 'Frank JA', 'Blaese RM', 'Ram Z']","['Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/*transplantation', 'Animals', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Choroid Plexus/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Ganciclovir/*toxicity', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Graft Survival', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Macaca mulatta/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Rats/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Subarachnoid Space', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1995 Jun;2(2):87-95.,,,,"['HStk', 'NeoR', 'lacZ']",,,,,,,,,,

The HPV E6 and E7 proteins bind to and inactivate the products of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor genes, which thereby allow the cervical carcinoma cells to circumvent the action of these tumor suppressor genes. We observed that the introduction of the antisense HPV 18 E6 and E7 sequences, as well as a sense cDNA for the human wild-type Rb gene into a human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), which is positive for the HPV 18 provirus, decreased the in vitro and in vivo growth rate of the transfected cells if both antisense transcripts for the HPV 18 E6 and E7 and sense transcripts for human Rb were expressed. In addition, overexpression of a complementary DNA (cDNA) for the Rb messenger RNA was sufficient to slow the proliferation of HeLa cells, and the level of Rb cDNA expression was correlated with the degree to which the rate of growth of the tumor was slowed. The results of our experiments show that the presence of HPV E6 and E7 proteins and the resultant inactivation of Rb in cervical carcinoma cells contributes to the neoplastic phenotype even in highly evolved cervical carcinoma cell lines such as HeLa, which have been derived from a cervical carcinoma patient at an advanced stage of the disease process. These data suggest that the HPV proteins play a role not only at the beginning of cervical cancer, but also at advanced stages of this disease. These experiments may lead to genetic approaches to the control of this disease that involve antisense sequences that downregulate the E6 and E7 genes or lead to expression of the Rb gene.","['Hu, G', 'Liu, W', 'Hanania, E G', 'Fu, S', 'Wang, T', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Hu G', 'Liu W', 'Hanania EG', 'Fu S', 'Wang T', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (E7 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Viral', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells/*drug effects/virology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Zinc Fingers']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1995 Mar;2(1):19-32.,,,,"['Rb', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral transfer of the IFN gamma gene was associated with decreased growth, decreased tumor invasiveness, IFN gamma production, and upregulation of MHC antigens. While the MDA-MB-435 produced higher levels of IFN gamma than MDA-MB-231, MHC class I and class II antigens were upregulated in both cell lines. Introduction of this vector into the human leukemia cell line K562 led to increased expression of MHC class I antigens, but not class II.

In contrast, A375 cells transfected with the sense MnSOD gene demonstrated increased resistance to irradiation compared to parental or vector-transfected A375 cells. The expression of the MnSOD gene in these transfected cell lines correlates with the up- or down-modulation of radiosensitivity.

Whereas injection of parental tumor cells resulted in progressive tumor growth, tumor cells secreting high levels of IL-2 were rejected. Furthermore, in animals vaccinated with IL-2-secreting cells, the immunosuppression associated with the inoculation of parental tumor cells did not develop, and these animals resisted a challenge with viable tumor cells. To better understand the functional differences in the anti-tumor responses of immune and tumor-bearing mice which are at the basis for these diverse responses, we used an in vitro model to analyze interactions between splenic lymphocytes and tumor cells. Spleen cells isolated from either tumor-bearing or immune mice proliferated vigorously when cultured alone for 6 days, but much less in the presence of parental tumor cells. This effect could not be transferred with supernatant from tumor cell lines. Spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice remained unresponsive, while those from immune mice proliferated well in response to IL-2-secreting tumor cells. Only spleen cells from immune animals were able to develop cytotoxicity against CMS5 cells following in vitro restimulation.

This obstacle can be circumvented by the introduction of chemotherapy resistance genes into the normal marrow cells, which are then transplanted back into the patient. To show that this approach can improve our ability to safely deliver high doses of chemotherapy, we used an animal model system to transplant bone marrow cells which have been transduced with a safety-modified retrovirus containing human multiple-drug resistance (MDR-1) cDNA into lethally irradiated mice. These studies produced mice whose bone marrow and peripheral blood displayed an increased level of MDR-1 expression and resistance to the myelotoxic side effects of Taxol. To determine whether sufficient numbers of early hematopoietic precursor cells were transduced with the MDR-1 retrovirus so that durable Taxol-resistant hematopoiesis would result, we serially transplanted the modified bone marrow cells into each of six successive cohorts of BALB/c mice. Taxol-resistant hematopoiesis with little or no myelosuppression was observed in all six of the cohorts. These data suggest that very early precursor cells were transduced by the vector. This animal model may be of use in the development of genetic therapy programs which use bone marrow to introduce therapeutic molecules into the systemic circulation, since it permits in vivo selection of genetically modified hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, the retroviral vector system we have used could have an immediate impact in the clinical setting, where it can protect patients from the myelosuppressive side effects of Taxol in advanced stages of human epithelial cancers.","['Hanania, E G', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Hanania EG', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

Fungal infections are rapidly becoming the single most serious supportive care problem for children with AML. Optimal initial empiric therapy, treatment of proven systemic infections, and current status of attempts at prophylaxis are reviewed. Finally, the issue of colony stimulating factor use in AML is broached. Hopefully, studies underway will demonstrate the benefits and risks of these agents in AML. The time is long past due for large, well designed studies of supportive care in AML.

Match related BMT in first remission achieved long-term disease free survival in well over half the young patients. However, as only 25-30% of patients have a matched sibling donor, other options for BMT has been explored, including autologous BMT and unrelated donor BMT. There are many issues that require further study regarding autologous transplant, including the efficacy and benefits of marrow purging. Unrelated donor transplants offer encouraging results in suitable patients, but bring with them the increased risk of complications. BMT is also successful in some children in second remission or who have refractory disease. A recent development in the transplant of children with AML is the use of nonradiation-containing conditioning regimens to avoid potential long-term sequelae of total body irradiation. Nonradiation regimens appear to be as efficacious as radiation-containing regimens for these children. The superiority of BMT over chemotherapy has recently been challenged, as improved supportive care and extremely intensive therapy have resulted in approximately 75% of children achieving a remission and 30-40% of patients surviving. Recent studies have focused upon answering the question regarding the role of BMT in children in first remission.

When cells were sensitised with high percentages of specific IgE, maximum degranulation was seen at concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml (aggregated OVA) and 50 ng/ml (DNP-HSA), while moderate degranulation was still seen at antigen concentrations as low as 50 and 2 ng/ml, respectively. Low-molecular weight aggregates of OVA and low-valency DNP4-HSA only stimulated degranulation when high percentages of RBL Fc epsilon receptor were occupied by antigen-specific IgE. The sensitising abilities of two anti-DNP monoclonal antibodies of differing affinities were compared. When challenged with low-valency antigen, only cells sensitised with the higher-affinity monoclonal antibody exhibited moderate levels of degranulation. Degranulation required exposure to high antigen challenge doses (5 micrograms/ml). Cells sensitised with either monoclonal antibody responded strongly when challenged with a wide range of concentrations (1-250 ng/ml) of high-valency DNP32-HSA, although greater sensitivity was always seen with the higher-affinity antibody. These results suggest that antigen valency is a critical parameter for mast cell function, and that low-affinity antibody may be capable of sensitising mast cells to high-valency antigen.","['Collins, A M', 'Thelian, D', 'Basil, M']","['Collins AM', 'Thelian D', 'Basil M']","['School of Microbiology and Immunology, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Antigens)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000237098 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1995 Aug;107(4):547-56. doi: 10.1159/000237098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These events cause perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis, which may affect the cell signalling machinery and cause the activation of catabolic enzymes. Exposure of EMT6 cells to III-2 resulted in depletion of nonprotein and protein thiols. Under hypoxic conditions, the depletion of reduced glutathione was less than that measured when cells were treated in air, whereas following an exposure to 500 microM III-2 for 2 h the enzymes glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were inhibited to a greater extent under hypoxia. Ca2+ homeostasis was disrupted with an initial shift from the mitochondrial to the cytoplasmic pool. The inhibition of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase resulted in accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm. At higher concentrations, further disruption was seen as a net loss of Ca2+ of the cytoplasmic excess with no change in the mitochondrial levels, resulting in lower total cellular Ca2+. Neither the inhibition of Ca(2+)-ATPase nor the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis were different under hypoxic vs. oxic conditions. Due to these observations, HL60 cells were used to measure whether III-2 stimulated apoptosis. Morphologic changes and DNA laddering were observed following exposure to the disulfide, with lower concentrations required to stimulate the cellular changes under hypoxia. These events may be the result of the disruption in Ca2+ homeostasis due to thiolation or alteration in redox status of the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kirkpatrick, D L', ""Sa'da, I A"", 'Chernoff, W', 'Kuperus, M']","['Kirkpatrick DL', ""Sa'da IA"", 'Chernoff W', 'Kuperus M']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '141400-57-9 (n-butyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glutathione Transferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1994;6(10-11):545-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From October 1988 to October 1991, 170 patients were randomized to receive either IFN-alpha or busulfan. Of 159 eligible patients, 31 (38.8%) of 80 patients in the IFN-alpha group and 43 (54.4%) of 79 patients in the busulfan group achieved complete hematologic remission, and 38.8% in the IFN-alpha group and 43.0% in the busulfan group achieved partial hematologic remission. A complete cytogenetic response was induced in seven (8.8%) of 80 patients treated with IFN-alpha and two (2.5%) of 79 patients treated with busulfan, and a partial cytogenetic response was 7.5% (6/80) and 2.5% (2/79), respectively. The difference in major (complete and partial) cytogenetic response between the two groups was significant (P = .046). At a median follow-up of 50 months, the predicted 5-year survival rate was 54% in the IFN-alpha group and 32% in the busulfan group (P = .0290), and the predicted 5-year rate of remaining in chronic phase was 41% in the IFN-alpha group and 29% in the busulfan group (P = .1165). As compared with the patients with no cytogenetic response, the patients with any cytogenetic response (complete, partial or minor) after the IFN-alpha or busulfan treatment were significantly superior in the duration of chronic phase (IFN-alpha group; P = .0017, busulfan group; P = .0010) even after correction for the time to response using the landmark analysis. However, there was no significant difference in survival rate in the IFN-alpha group (P = .1065). There was no significant difference in survival rate (P = .3923) and the duration of chronic phase (P = .6258) between the IFN-alpha and the busulfan group in the patients with a cytogenetic response (complete, partial or minor). These results demonstrate that IFN-alpha treatment produces a significantly superior cytogenetic response and survival rate as compared with the busulfan treatment, and unexpectedly, that busulfan can also eliminate Philadelphia chromosome positive clone in a few patients who showed prolonged survival rate and duration of chronic phase.","['Ohnishi, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kamada, N', 'Onozawa, K', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Dohy, H', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Tsubaki, K']","['Ohnishi K', 'Ohno R', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamada N', 'Onozawa K', 'Kuramoto A', 'Dohy H', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Miyawaki S', 'Tsubaki K', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77395-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):906-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a clinical phase I/II trial applying a monoclonal antibody neutralizing human tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) during pretransplant conditioning as additional prophylaxis in high-risk patients admitted to allogeneic BMT; TNF alpha serum levels and clinical courses in 21 patients receiving anti-TNF alpha prophylaxis were compared with data from 22 historical controls. Absence of significant release of TNF alpha in the period of busulphan (BUS) treatment, but significant induction of TNF alpha by total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (CY) conditioning were correlated with significantly earlier onset of acute GVHD in patients receiving TBI/CY regimens as compared with BUS/CY-treated patients. Prophylactic application of monoclonal anti-TNF alpha seemed to postpone onset of acute GVHD from day 15 to day 25 (P < .05) after TBI/CY and from day 33 to day 53 after BUS/CY (P < .10) conditioning. Application of monoclonal anti-TNF alpha in low and intermediate doses was safe and not associated with an increased incidence of infectious or hematologic complications. Thus, our data provide indirect and direct evidence for involvement of conditioning-related cytokine release in induction of early acute GVHD in the clinical setting and support further investigation of this novel approach in randomized trials.","['Holler, E', 'Kolb, H J', 'Mittermuller, J', 'Kaul, M', 'Ledderose, G', 'Duell, T', 'Seeber, B', 'Schleuning, M', 'Hintermeier-Knabe, R', 'Ertl, B']","['Holler E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Mittermuller J', 'Kaul M', 'Ledderose G', 'Duell T', 'Seeber B', 'Schleuning M', 'Hintermeier-Knabe R', 'Ertl B', 'et al.']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77393-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):890-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical examination of APL cells shows a unique abnormal distribution of anti-PML and anti-RAR alpha antibody labeling. The PML labeling pattern observed in normal cells consists of 5 to 10 discrete spherical nuclear bodies called PODs (for ""PML oncogenic domains""), whereas that of APL consists of a smaller and far more numerous speckled pattern. We examined malignant cells from patients with a variety of hematopoietic cancers by immunohistochemistry (IH) and found this abnormal PML pattern expressed in cells from patients with t(15;17)-associated leukemia but not in patients with other neoplastic disorders. IH results agreed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for PML/RAR-alpha in 31 of 32 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, including 5 of 5 patients in whom the initial clinical diagnosis of APL was not supported by cytogenetics, molecular tests, or response to all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Cells from patients with APL were examined during the course of retinoid therapy and at the time of complete remission and relapse. Reorganization of the PML labeling into PODs with normal appearance was observed in cells from patients who received RA. IH showed primarily normal PML staining during clinical remission, although the APL-specific labeling pattern was again seen in cells taken from patients at the time of relapse. Thus, IH provides an independent assay for the presence and expression of the molecular rearrangement of APL. The relative ease and speed of detecting the APL-specific PML labeling pattern should make IH a useful diagnostic tool to guide specific therapy of APL, and establish a direct assay for PML/RAR-alpha protein expression and localization in individual patient cells.","['Dyck, J A', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Evans, R M', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Dyck JA', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Evans RM', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77389-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):862-7.,,,['CA 57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['PML', 'RARA']",,,,,,,,,,

Currently available HLA-A, -B, and -DR serologic testing may not be sensitive enough to detect clinically relevant donor/recipient (D/R) nonidentity. Better HLA matching of D/R pairs using molecular typing for class II antigens in combination with intensive GVHD prophylaxis may potentially reduce the incidence of GVHD and lead to an improved outcome of MUD transplantation. Between July 1991 and August 1993, thirty consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies underwent MUD transplantation from donors who were identical for HLA -A, -B, and -DR by serologic typing. Twenty-five D/R pairs were matched for DRB and DQB by molecular typing (restriction fragment-length polymorphism and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization analyses), whereas five were allele mismatched at either DRB or DQB. All patients also received GVHD prophylaxis with the combination of cyclosporine (CSA), methotrexate (MTX), and prednisone (PSE). The median age was 35 years (range, 15 to 50). The diagnoses were: chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) (16), CML in more than CP (3), acute leukemia in more than first complete remission (CR) (8), acute leukemia in first CR (1), and advanced high-grade lymphoma (2). The preparative regimen consisted of 1,320 cGy fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY) daily for 2 days in 17 good-risk patients (CML/CP and acute leukemia first CR); and 1,320 cGy FTBI in combination with 60 mg/kg etoposide and 20 to 60 mg/kg CY in 13 patients with advanced leukemia and lymphoma.

Immunophenotypic analysis was performed in each case; 12 cases were evaluated by cytogenetics, and gene rearrangement studies were performed in 14 cases. The median age was 57 years with a male predominance (M:F, 15:10). The median presenting lymphocyte count was 36.3 x 10(9)/L (range, 3.9 to 438 x 10(9)/L). Fourteen patients (56%) had shotty adenopathy and ten (40%) had mild-to-moderate splenomegaly at presentation; four (16%) had erythematous skin lesions. The lymphocytes were predominantly small; some cases had a minor component of medium-sized cells (< 10%). The nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios were uniformly high with round to oval nuclei; however, a wide spectrum of nuclear outlines could be found, ranging from minimally to markedly convoluted. Nucleoli were either absent or small and inconspicuous. These lymphocytes did not have the morphology of prolymphocytes and did not contain cytoplasmic granules. Bone marrow infiltration was generally in an interstitial pattern; the degree of involvement ranged from 15% to 90%. Immunophenotyping showed that the lymphocytes were mature T-cells with a predominant CD4+ immunophenotype. Three cases displayed a CD8+ immunophenotype. The patients were treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens with only a minimal response observed in two of 20 patients. We conclude that T-CLL is an uncommon chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD) that can be morphologically similar to B-CLL, is distinct from T-prolymphocytic leukemia, and has an aggressive clinical course that is refractory to therapy. It may also be difficult to distinguish T-CLL from other T-CLPD, especially the leukemic phase of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and some cases of Sezary syndrome.","['Hoyer, J D', 'Ross, C W', 'Li, C Y', 'Witzig, T E', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Dewald, G W', 'Hanson, C A']","['Hoyer JD', 'Ross CW', 'Li CY', 'Witzig TE', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Dewald GW', 'Hanson CA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77425-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1163-9.,,['Blood. 1996 Apr 15;87(8):3520-1.

The p53 tumor-suppressor gene is a critical component of two distinct cellular responses to DNA damage, the induction of a reversible arrest at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, and the activation of apoptosis, a genetic program of autonomous cell death. Expression of the BCR-ABL chimeric gene produced by a balanced translocation in chronic myeloid leukemia, confers resistance to multiple genotoxic anticancer agents. BCR-ABL expression inhibits the apoptotic response to DNA damage without altering either the p53-dependent WAF1/CIP1-mediated G1 arrest or DNA repair. BCR-ABL-mediated inhibition of DNA damage-induced apoptosis is associated with a prolongation of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M restriction point; the delay of G2/M transition may allow time to repair and complete DNA replication and chromosomal segregation, thereby preventing a mitotic catastrophe. The inherent resistance of human cancers to genotoxic agents may result not only by the loss or inactivation of the wild-type p53 gene, but also by genetic alterations such as BCR-ABL that can delay G2/M transition after DNA damage.","['Bedi, A', 'Barber, J P', 'Bedi, G C', 'el-Deiry, W S', 'Sidransky, D', 'Vala, M S', 'Akhtar, A J', 'Hilton, J', 'Jones, R J']","['Bedi A', 'Barber JP', 'Bedi GC', 'el-Deiry WS', 'Sidransky D', 'Vala MS', 'Akhtar AJ', 'Hilton J', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77423-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1148-58.,,,['P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['BCR-ABL'],,,,,,,,,,

Neither a qualitative nor a quantitative difference in cytokine production and proliferative capacity was observed in CLL-derived purified T cells compared with normal individuals, when T cells were stimulated by different pathways, including CD3, CD2, and costimulation with CD28. Addition of autologous accessory cells (aAC), however, dramatically influenced the cytokine pattern of normal versus B-CLL-derived T cells. CLL cells as aAC caused a marked increase of IL-2, whereas IFN-gamma was only slightly induced and IL-4 was not influenced. In contrast, in normal individuals addition of aAC, which predominantly consisted of monocytes, resulted in a significant increase of IFN-gamma and a reduction of IL-4 secretion. IL-2 production was inhibited by higher concentrations of aAC. The increased stimulation of IL-2 production by CLL cells was not specific to the leukemic cell population, as purified B cells from normal individuals had the same effect. On the other hand, purified monocytes from CLL patients and controls both induced IFN-gamma production and inhibited IL-4 secretion. After antigen-specific stimulation with tetanus toxoid, cytokine secretion was influenced by the type of aAC in a similar pattern. We conclude that T helper cells derived from patients with B-CLL are intrinsically normal and that the predominance of B cells as accessory cells in CLL significantly alters the immune function of T helper cells in vitro.","['Decker, T', 'Flohr, T', 'Trautmann, P', 'Aman, M J', 'Holter, W', 'Majdic, O', 'Huber, C', 'Peschel, C']","['Decker T', 'Flohr T', 'Trautmann P', 'Aman MJ', 'Holter W', 'Majdic O', 'Huber C', 'Peschel C']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD2 Antigens/physiology', 'CD3 Complex/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetanus Toxoid/immunology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77419-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1115-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under reducing conditions, MoAb M27 precipitated a 60-kD surface-membrane molecule from Pre-ALP cells. Expression cloning of Pre-ALP cDNA showed that M27 recognizes carboxypeptidase M (CPM), a cell-surface, zinc-dependent protease known to cleave off basic C-terminal amino acids from peptide hormones. Using M27 antibody, CPM was detected only at discrete B lymphocyte developmental stages, namely on committed precursors and on germinal center cells. CPM was also expressed on mature T cells, mainly after activation. These results provide the first description of a carboxy-peptidase on lymphoid cells. In addition, CPM was found on granulocytes and monocytes, but not on their progenitors. Strikingly, CPM was present only on CD38+ cells, irrespective of lineage affiliation. Of interest, CPM displayed a largely overlapping distribution with the CD10 and CD13 peptidases, with which it shares common substrates (enkephalins, bradykinin). Collectively, the present data show a previously unrecognized distribution pattern of CPM on lymphoid and myeloid cells and suggest that CPM may cooperate with CD10 and CD13 to regulate biologic activity of peptide hormones on leukocytes.","['de Saint-Vis, B', 'Cupillard, L', 'Pandrau-Garcia, D', 'Ho, S', 'Renard, N', 'Grouard, G', 'Duvert, V', 'Thomas, X', 'Galizzi, J P', 'Banchereau, J']","['de Saint-Vis B', 'Cupillard L', 'Pandrau-Garcia D', 'Ho S', 'Renard N', 'Grouard G', 'Duvert V', 'Thomas X', 'Galizzi JP', 'Banchereau J', 'et al.']","['Laboratory for Immunological Research, Schering-Plough, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.17.12 (carboxypeptidase M)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow/embryology/*enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD13 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/analysis', 'Neprilysin/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Zinc/physiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77417-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1098-105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analyses have shown two groups of B-CLL that can be distinguished based on their capacity to proliferate in response to B-cell antigen receptor complex (BCR) cross-linking. To investigate the molecular basis for this phenomenon, we have analyzed both architecture and functional properties of BCR complexes on these two groups of B-CLL. Both groups were found to express structurally similar BCR. However, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity associated with and specific for BCR constituents was strongly diminished in nonresponsive B-CLL. Moreover, the PTK-dependent assembly of Shc/Grb2 complexes, which may couple the BCR to p21ras, was absent in these B-CLL. Finally, of all PTKs tested, the expression of PTK syk was found to be considerably lower in nonresponsive B-CLL. Thus, absence of mitogenic responses upon BCR cross-linking in particular B-CLL was found to be strictly correlated with diminished induction of BCR-associated PTK activity and lower levels of PTK syk. Because nonresponsive B-CLL closely resembles tolerant autoreactive B cells both functionally and biochemically, distinction between B-CLL with respect to functional properties in vitro may be determined by differences in antigen encounter in vivo.","['Lankester, A C', 'van Schijndel, G M', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'van Oers, M H', 'van Noesel, C J', 'van Lier, R A']","['Lankester AC', 'van Schijndel GM', 'van der Schoot CE', 'van Oers MH', 'van Noesel CJ', 'van Lier RA']","['Department of Clinical Viro-Immunology and Immunohematology, Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism/*physiology', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Syk Kinase']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77416-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1090-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicate that ATRA treatment in vitro of the APL NB4 cell line can affect their procoagulant activity (PCA). To assess whether ATRA has this effect also in vivo, we prospectively studied the PCA of bone marrow blasts from APL patients on therapy with ATRA alone or associated with chemotherapy. Samples were obtained before, during, and after ATRA. To characterize the coagulopathy, we measured a series of plasma hemostatic variables before and during the first two weeks of therapy, as follows: (1) markers of hypercoagulability; (2) natural anticoagulants; (3) fibrinolysis proteins; and (4) elastase. The results by enzymatic and immunologic methods show that both total (tissue factor-like) and factor VII-independent (cancer procoagulant-like) blast cell PCAs, present before therapy, were reduced during (69% and 65% decrement, respectively) and virtually undetectable after ATRA. The plasma hemostatic assessment of patients before treatment was elevated hypercoagulability markers, low mean protein C, normal fibrinolysis proteins, and increased elastase. After starting ATRA, hypercoagulability markers were reduced within 4 to 8 days, protein C augmented, the overall fibrinolytic balance was unmodified, and elastase remained elevated. These results were not different either with or without chemotherapy and are consistent with the clinical findings of rapid improvement of the coagulopathy.","['Falanga, A', 'Iacoviello, L', 'Evangelista, V', 'Belotti, D', 'Consonni, R', ""D'Orazio, A"", 'Robba, L', 'Donati, M B', 'Barbui, T']","['Falanga A', 'Iacoviello L', 'Evangelista V', 'Belotti D', 'Consonni R', ""D'Orazio A"", 'Robba L', 'Donati MB', 'Barbui T']","['Hematology Division, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysis', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Thromboplastin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77414-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Aug 1;86(3):1072-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two human megakaryoblastic tumor cell lines (DAMI, CHRF-288-11) and the human erythroleukemia cell line (HEL) the DRK current was not detected. To determine if the absence of the DRK current in the tumor cells is the result of the underlying malignant state, we examined megakaryocytes from myelogenous leukemia patients. In 24 of 29 megakaryocytes from the myelogenous leukemia patients, the DRK current was greatly suppressed, whereas in the remaining 5 megakaryocytes a normal large amplitude DRK current was present. We had the opportunity to reexamine megakaryocytes from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3), after chemotherapy. Whereas the DRK current was suppressed before treatment, the current reappeared after chemotherapy. Exposure to the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, caused the appearance of a voltage-gated outward current in the megakaryocytes of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. This finding suggests either that the channels underlying the DRK current are present but somehow suppressed in megakaryocytes from these patients or that forskolin induces a different voltage-gated outward current. We suggest that the megakaryocytes from the myelogenous leukemia patients with suppressed DRK current are abnormal, whereas the others may be normal megakaryocytes.

Here we demonstrate that AA is a preferred substrate in this acetylation reaction over other common fatty acids such as palmitic (PA), oleic, linoleic or linolenic. This was unexpected because AA is not considered as a fuel fatty acid. In Jurcat cells, AA is also preferred as a substrate for beta-oxidation over PA. In contrast, in PBML, PA was clearly preferred as substrate for beta-oxidation over AA, in accordance with previous observations. The difference between Jurcat cells and PBML was not dependent on culture conditions, because phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 activated PBML, kept in culture, showed the same PA preference as freshly prepared non-activated PBML. Furthermore, we observed differences between Jurcat cells and PBML in their relative content of fatty acids and in the incorporation of PA and AA into triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Taken together, our results show differences in beta-oxidation between Jurcat cells and PBML, and suggest the involvement of peroxisomal, besides mitochondrial, beta-oxidation, in the acetylation of PABA with fatty acids as acetyl donors.","['Barbieri, B', 'Papadogiannakis, N', 'Eneroth, P', 'Olding, L B']","['Barbieri B', 'Papadogiannakis N', 'Eneroth P', 'Olding LB']","['Department of Immunology, Microbiology, Pathology and Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (para-Aminobenzoates)', '04Z20NMK31 (Acedoben)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', 'TL2TJE8QTX (4-Aminobenzoic Acid)']",IM,"['4-Aminobenzoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Acetylation', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Triglycerides/metabolism', 'para-Aminobenzoates']",1995/07/13 00:00,1995/07/13 00:01,['1995/07/13 00:00'],"['1995/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(95)00070-S [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(95)00070-s [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Jul 13;1257(2):157-66. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(95)00070-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the activity of the main desaturation-elongation enzymes in human B-(Reh-6, Raji, Ramos) and T-(CEM, Jurkat) lymphocytic, promonocytic (U937), promyelocytic (HL-60) and pluripotent myeloid (K562) cell lineages, as well as the changes induced by cell differentiation. Cells were incubated with 14C-labelled 18:0, 18:2(n - 6) and 18:3(n - 3) or supplemented with the corresponding unlabelled fatty acid and synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was evaluated by argentation-TLC and GLC. The main activity present in most cells was delta 9-desaturase (range between 200-1000 pmol/24 h per 10(6) cells) that was regulated by the type of free fatty acids in culture media. A great variability in the activities of delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase was observed. They were virtually absent in B-cells and only one (Jurkat) T-cell line synthesized significant amounts of (n - 6) and (n - 3) PUFA. The main PUFA formed by Jurkat cells were 20:3 and 20:4(n - 6) (30 and 40%, respectively, of cell lipid radioactivity) and 20:5, 22:5 and 22:6(n - 3) (60, 20 and 10%, respectively, of cell radioactivity). Cell differentiation caused complex changes in desaturase activities. The activity of delta 9-desaturase increased with the degree of differentiation of B-cells. Differentiation of U937 cells to macrophages with PMA caused a 2-3-fold increase in the activity of (delta 6 + delta 5)- and delta 9-desaturases and no changes and a 2-fold decrease, respectively, if the inducer was DMSO. Differentiation of HL-60 cells to granulocytes with DMSO virtually abolished delta 9-desaturase activity and greatly reduced that of delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases. delta 9-Desaturase activity increased (2.5-fold) in myeloid K562 cells differentiated to erythroblasts with hemin. No induction of delta 6-desaturase, absent in K562 cells, occurred after differentiation to erythroblasts or megakaryoblasts and they synthesized alternative PUFA through sequential elongation and delta 5-desaturation of 18:2(n - 6) and 18:3(n - 3). The activities of delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase in HL-60 and U937 cells increased when differentiation also stimulated the synthesis of eicosanoids and extracellular release of PUFA.","['Marzo, I', 'Martinez-Lorenzo, M J', 'Anel, A', 'Desportes, P', 'Alava, M A', 'Naval, J', 'Pineiro, A']","['Marzo I', 'Martinez-Lorenzo MJ', 'Anel A', 'Desportes P', 'Alava MA', 'Naval J', 'Pineiro A']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.19.1 (Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase/metabolism']",1995/07/13 00:00,1995/07/13 00:01,['1995/07/13 00:00'],"['1995/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(95)00064-J [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(95)00064-j [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Jul 13;1257(2):140-8. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(95)00064-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic blasts (LB) from responsive patients showed low levels of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT). DESIGN: An in vitro study was performed to evaluate OGAT levels and sensitivity to temozolomide (a triazene compound that spontaneously decomposes into the active metabolite of dacarbazine) in a relatively large number of LB samples. RESULTS: OGAT levels varied widely among the LB of different patients, with a mean value higher in acute lymphoblastic leukaemias than in AML. About 25% of LB obtained from patients with AML showed low OGAT activity, in the range corresponding to that observed in leukaemic patients responsive to dacarbazine in vivo. A reasonable inverse correlation was found between OGAT levels and LB sensitivity to temozolomide. CONCLUSIONS: Triazenes could have a therapeutic potential in human leukaemias. Moreover, OGAT determination could provide rapid and reliable information about a patient's susceptibility to these antitumor agents.","[""D'Atri, S"", 'Piccioni, D', 'Castellano, A', 'Tuorto, V', 'Franchi, A', 'Lu, K', 'Christiansen, N', 'Frankel, S', 'Rustum, Y M', 'Papa, G']","[""D'Atri S"", 'Piccioni D', 'Castellano A', 'Tuorto V', 'Franchi A', 'Lu K', 'Christiansen N', 'Frankel S', 'Rustum YM', 'Papa G', 'et al.']","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata (IDI), University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Temozolomide']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059189 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61201-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Apr;6(4):389-93. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of intraventricular chemotherapy (IVC) in its treatment is still a matter for debate. Data suggesting benefit from it have been countered by statements of concern regarding the potential complications associated with its use. This report details our results from using IVC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared two groups of adult patients with ALL at their first meningeal involvement. Twelve of them were submitted to ILC and 9 to IVC. RESULTS: Our data showed that IVC yielded a higher rate of complete response (88% vs. 33%) and a lower incidence of second CNS relapse than did ILC (none vs. 50%). Even though there were more long-term disease-free survivors (33% vs. 8%) among the IVC patients, the difference in median event-free survival was not significant (120 vs. 80 weeks; p = 0.66). IVC was associated with a longer overall survival (p = 0.005) and CNS remission time (p = 0.046). Two cases refractory to ILC were later fully responsive to IVC. There were 22% device-related and 11% drug-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results are promising, but the small series does not allow for any definite conclusion. In our opinion, the hazards inherent in the placement and operation of the device do not outweight the benefits of IVC for the treatment of overt meningeal leukemia and should not preclude its use. Accurate neurosurgical technique, meticulous care in drug administration and experience with this form of therapy can all contribute to minimizing complications so that full advantage can be taken of IVC's potential.","['Iacoangeli, M', 'Roselli, R', 'Pagano, L', 'Leone, G', 'Marra, R', 'Pompucci, A', 'Trignani, R', 'Scerrati, M']","['Iacoangeli M', 'Roselli R', 'Pagano L', 'Leone G', 'Marra R', 'Pompucci A', 'Trignani R', 'Scerrati M']","['Institute of Neurosurgery, Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059187 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61199-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Apr;6(4):377-82. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059187.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to identify predictive factors and evaluate the effects of concomitant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 102 patients with active HCL given cladribine for 7 days. Pretreatment parameters predicting neutropenic fever were analysed. Twelve patients at high risk for febrile complications also received 400 micrograms GM-CSF per day on days 1 through 21. RESULTS: Pretreatment anemia, hypocholesterolemia, bone marrow differential with a high percentage of hairy cells and a low percentage of myelopoietic cells, low albumin, and high C-reactive protein predicted neutropenic fever. The addition of GM-CSF did not improve the kinetics of recovery for neutrophils, hemoglobin or platelets, as compared to matched control patients. However, GM-CSF significantly reduced cladribine-induced lymphopenia, but not the incidence of neutropenic fever. CONCLUSION: Factors predicting febrile neutropenia were identified. GM-CSF protected from cladribine lymphotoxicity but did not improve neutropenia or febrile episodes.","['Juliusson, G', 'Lenkei, R', 'Tjonnfjord, G', 'Heldal, D', 'Liliemark, J']","['Juliusson G', 'Lenkei R', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Heldal D', 'Liliemark J']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cladribine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059186 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61198-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Apr;6(4):371-5. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theophylline metabolism was studied using seven human cytochrome P-450 isoforms (CYPs), namely CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, and microsomal epoxide hydroxylase (EH), expressed in human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2. At a high theophylline concentration of 10 mM four CYPs (1A1, 1A2, 2D6, 2E1) catalyzed the metabolism of theophylline. 3. Theophylline had the highest affinity (apparent Km range 0.2-1.0 mM) for the CYP1A subfamily and the kinetics of metabolic formation mediated by CYP1A2 indicated substrate-inhibition (Ki range 9-16 mM). 4. CYP1A2 catalyzed the demethylation of theophylline as well as its hydroxylation, and was associated with the highest intrinsic clearance (1995 l h-1 per mol CYP) to 1,3-dimethyluric acid (DMU). Therefore, this isoform can be considered to be the most important enzyme involved in theophylline metabolism in vitro. 5. CYP2E1 was responsible for a relatively high intrinsic clearance by 8-hydroxylation (289 l h-1 per mol CYP). The apparent Km value of this reaction was about 15 mM, suggesting that CYP2E1 may be the low-affinity high-capacity isoform involved in theophylline metabolism. 6. The affinity of theophylline for CYP1A1 was comparable with that of its homologue 1A2. When induced, the participation of CYP1A1 in theophylline metabolism may be important. 7. CYP2D6 played only a minor role and CYP3A4 was not active in the in vitro metabolism of theophylline. 8. Our findings confirm the major role of CYP1A2 in theophylline metabolism and explain why in vivo the elimination kinetics of theophylline are non-linear and in vitro theophylline metabolism by human liver microsomes does not obey monophasic kinetics. 9. The data suggest also that not only tobacco smoking but also chronic alcohol intake may influence theophylline elimination in man as ethanol induces CYP2E1.","['Ha, H R', 'Chen, J', 'Freiburghaus, A U', 'Follath, F']","['Ha HR', 'Chen J', 'Freiburghaus AU', 'Follath F']","['Cardiovascular Therapy Research Unit, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Xanthines)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '7EE8WCA32U (1-methylxanthine)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'C222JTI9I3 (1,3-dimethyluric acid)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'WS6X982OEC (3-methylxanthine)']",IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/metabolism', '*Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation', 'Isoenzymes', 'Microsomes, Liver/enzymology', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Smoking/metabolism', 'Theophylline/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uric Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Xanthines/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04455.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1995 Mar;39(3):321-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04455.x.,,,,,,,PMC1365010,,,,,,,

The two cDNAs are identical except that the h alpha CTR cDNA contains a 48 bp insert sequence that encodes a 16 amino acid domain in the first cytosolic loop of the receptor. Stable transfection of each receptor cDNA into murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells resulted in the expression of receptors with high affinity for radiolabelled salmon calcitonin (h alpha CTR Kd 0.09 nM, h beta CTR Kd 0.12 nM). Ligand competition binding studies did not reveal any significant pharmacological difference between the receptor isoforms. In transfected MEL cells and COS-1 cells the h beta CTR isoform was expressed at tenfold higher levels than the h alpha CTR.

The suggestion, however, has not been supported by experimental or other epidemiologic studies. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if preconceptional irradiation of males and females from internally deposited radionuclides affects mortality and risk of developing cancer in their offspring. METHODS: The offspring of 260 females (n = 143) and 320 males (n = 226) who lived longer than 1 year after receiving Thorotrast (a compound no longer in use) for cerebral arteriography were studied for mortality rate and the risk for developing cancer. Thorotrast was used as a contrast medium containing a 20% colloidal solution of thorium dioxide-Th 232, an alpha particle-emitting radionuclide, which is retained lifelong in nearly all organs. The offspring of the exposed patients were identified by manual linkage with the municipal population registers and followed-up for vital status by computerized linkage with the Danish National Central Population Registry and for incidence of cancer by computerized linkage with the Danish National Cancer Registry. The standardized mortality/morbidity ratios (SMRs) for death and for site-specific incidence of cancer in the offspring were calculated as ratios of the observed rates in the study population to the expected rates in the general population. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 40 years, four cases of cancer (breast [one], uterine cervix [one], melanoma of skin [one], and retinoblastoma [one]) versus 2.9 cases expected, developed among 143 children born to mothers who received injections of Thorotrast (SMR = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-3.5), while six cases of cancer (one case each of cancer of lung, testis, thyroid, and Hodgkin's lymphoma and two cases of melanoma of skin), versus 4.5 expected, occurred among 226 children of exposed fathers (SMR = 1.3; 95% CI = 0.5-2.9). No case of leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in any of the offspring studied. Mortality was lower than expected both for children of exposed mothers (SMR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.3-1.5) and of exposed fathers (SMR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the previously proposed association between parental exposure to radiation and the risk of childhood leukemia and lymphoma. Furthermore, since mortality from all causes was not increased in any offspring, our results do not support the belief that preconceptional parental low-dose exposure to alpha radiation increases the incidence of cancer or mortality in the offspring.","['Andersson, M', 'Juel, K', 'Ishikawa, Y', 'Storm, H H']","['Andersson M', 'Juel K', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Storm HH']","['Danish Cancer Society, Division for Cancer Epidemiology, University Hospital, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alpha Particles/*adverse effects', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Thorium Dioxide/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1994/12/21 00:00,1994/12/21 00:01,['1994/12/21 00:00'],"['1994/12/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.24.1866 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Dec 21;86(24):1866-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.24.1866.,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Apr 19;87(8):606-7.

The primary structure of CNTF suggests it to be a cytosolic protein with strong similarity to the alpha-helical cytokine family which is characterized by a bundle of four anti-parallel helices. CNTF exerts its activity via complexation with CNTF receptor (CNTF-R). This complex consists of a CNTF-binding protein (CNTF-R) and two proteins important for signal transduction [gp130 and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R)]. We have shortened the cDNA coding for CNTF at both the 5' and the 3' end and expressed the truncated proteins in bacteria. Biological activities of the protein preparations were determined by their ability to induce proliferation of BAF/3 cells that were stably transfected with CNTF-R, gp130 and LIF-R cDNAs. CNTF proteins with 14 amino acid residues removed from the N-terminus were biologically active whereas the removal of 23 amino acids resulted in an inactive protein. In addition, 18 amino acid residues could be removed from the C-terminus of the CNTF protein without apparent loss of bioactivity, but further truncation at the C-terminus yielded biologically inactive proteins. The introduction of two point mutations into the CNTF protein at a site that presumably interacts with one of the two signal-transducing proteins resulted in a CNTF mutant with no measurable bioactivity. In addition, a model of the three-dimensional structure of human CNTF was constructed using the recently established structural co-ordinates of the related cytokine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. CD spectra of CNTF together with our mutational analysis and our three-dimensional model fully support the view that CNTF belongs to the family of alpha-helical cytokines. It is expected that our results will facilitate the rational design of CNTF mutants with agonistic or antagonistic properties.","['Kruttgen, A', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Kurapkat, G', 'Weis, J', 'Simon, R', 'Thier, M', 'Schroder, M', 'Heinrich, P', 'Wollmer, A', 'Comeau, M']","['Kruttgen A', 'Grotzinger J', 'Kurapkat G', 'Weis J', 'Simon R', 'Thier M', 'Schroder M', 'Heinrich P', 'Wollmer A', 'Comeau M', 'et al.']","['Institute of Biochemistry, RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3090215 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Jul 1;309 ( Pt 1):215-20. doi: 10.1042/bj3090215.,,,,,,,PMC1135822,,,,,,,

Lesions of the lateral vestibular nucleus of the medulla oblongata (three cases) and lateral ventricular wall (one case) were examined by reconstruction of 200 serial sections, and the capillary diameter in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata was measured morphometrically in all cases. The vascular changes commonly found in and around the parenchymal lesions in all cases were: (1) dilatation and endothelial swelling of almost all vessels ranging from small arteries to veins, being especially severe with undulation in small arteries and arterioles, and (2) fibrinoid degeneration and hemorrhage involving selectively the arterioles and capillaries on the arterial side. These vascular changes in the medulla oblongata were essentially the same as those in the third ventricular wall, but differed in their severity. Capillary diameter in these cases was significantly larger than that in seven control cases. Such vascular changes, especially a dysoric change on the arterial side, could not be ascribed to secondary change following changes in the parenchyma, and were, therefore, considered to be a lesion essential to WE, as in the case of the parenchymal lesion.","['Okeda, R', 'Taki, K', 'Ikari, R', 'Funata, N']","['Okeda R', 'Taki K', 'Ikari R', 'Funata N']","['Department of Neuropathology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcoholism/complications/pathology', 'Blood Vessels/*pathology', 'Capillaries/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Medulla Oblongata/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Vestibular Nuclei/pathology', 'Wernicke Encephalopathy/complications/*pathology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00307646 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 1995;89(5):420-4. doi: 10.1007/BF00307646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, between 5 and 8 weeks after FeLV infection, all 19 cats with persistent FeLV infection but not the FeLV-negative cats died from a panleukopenia-like syndrome. No feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) antigen was found in feces by latex agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunoelectron microscopy. No enteropathogenic bacteria were found. Histopathology revealed changes resembling those of FPLV infection such as destruction of crypts and pancytopenia of bone marrow. Neither clinical signs nor seroconversion to FPLV could be induced by transmitting intestinal extracts to two SPF cats. However, FPLV antigen was demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay in intestinal cryostat sections of diseased animals. FPLV could also be demonstrated in intestinal extracts by immunoelectron microscopy, by latex agglutination and ELISA after anti-FPLV antibodies were removed from immune-complexed FPLV by ultracentrifugation over a CsCl gradient at pH 2.0. From these experiments it was concluded that the panleukopenia-like syndrome of FeLV may not be caused by FeLV alone but at least in some cases by co-infection with FeLV and FPLV. In addition, some form of 'cooperation' between FeLV and FPLV must be postulated because neither virus alone induced symptoms.","['Lutz, H', 'Castelli, I', 'Ehrensperger, F', 'Pospischil, A', 'Rosskopf, M', 'Siegl, G', 'Grob, M', 'Martinod, S']","['Lutz H', 'Castelli I', 'Ehrensperger F', 'Pospischil A', 'Rosskopf M', 'Siegl G', 'Grob M', 'Martinod S']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cats', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient/veterinary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Feline Panleukopenia/*etiology/immunology/pathology/transmission', 'Feline Panleukopenia Virus/*immunology/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/veterinary', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Latex Fixation Tests/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology/virology', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron/veterinary', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Syndrome', 'Viremia/immunology/veterinary']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(94)07003-P [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(94)07003-p [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1995 May;46(1-2):21-33. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(94)07003-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kittens were divided into four equal groups and were orally administered either a high dose of diethylcarbamazine (DECH, 12 mg kg-1), a low dose of diethylcarbamazine (DECL, 3 mg kg-1), 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, 15 mg kg-1, b.i.d.), or a placebo (250 mg granular dextrose) daily for 10 weeks. Blood was collected at 2-week intervals for complete blood counts (CBC) and flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Plasma was assayed for antibodies to FeLV gp70 and for FeLV p27 antigen using ELISA assays. For FACS analysis, lymphocytes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to feline Pan T, CD8+, CD4+, and B cell (Anti-Ig) antigens. In the placebo treated cats, FeLVR infection caused an early (2 weeks p.i.) and persistent decrease in leukocyte numbers attributable primarily to a decrease in neutrophil numbers and a secondary lesser decrease in B and CD4+ lymphocyte numbers. The DEC-treated groups showed a delayed but similar leukopenia by 4 weeks p.i. The lymphopenia in the DEC groups (primarily B cells and CD4+ cells) was reversed by 10 weeks p.i., but the neutropenia persisted. AZT treatment inhibited FeLVR-induced lymphopenia but did not prevent a reduction in neutrophil numbers. A marked p27 antigenemia that peaked at 4 weeks p.i. was noted in the placebo treated cats and in most cats (11/12) treated with either dose of DEC. However, AZT significantly inhibited the p27 antigenemia and all cats were negative for p27 antigen between 6 and 10 weeks of treatment. In general, placebo treated cats as well as DECH and DECL cats had low levels of antibody to gp70 throughout the study, suggesting FeLVR-induced immunosuppression. In contrast, significantly higher titers of anti-gp70 antibodies were seen in AZT-treated cats at 6 weeks p.i., and were maintained throughout treatment. Eighteen month survival rates provide efficacy data for AZT as well as both DEC treatment groups. While all placebo treated cats were euthanized by 52 weeks p.i. due to FeLV associated lymphomas with a mean survival time of 35.5 weeks p.i., median survival time of the AZT treated group was > or = 102 weeks p.i., while that of the DECH and DECL groups was 69.7 and 72 weeks p.i., respectively. Thus, DEC as well as AZT therapy delays the development of lymphomas associated with FeLV infection and significantly improves survival.","['Nelson, P', 'Sellon, R', 'Novotney, C', 'Devera, C', 'Davidian, M', 'English, R', 'Tompkins, M', 'Tompkins, W']","['Nelson P', 'Sellon R', 'Novotney C', 'Devera C', 'Davidian M', 'English R', 'Tompkins M', 'Tompkins W']","['Department of Microbiology, Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'V867Q8X3ZD (Diethylcarbamazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Cats', 'Diethylcarbamazine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Leukopenia/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*veterinary', 'Random Allocation', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/immunology/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy/immunology/*veterinary', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(94)07017-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(94)07017-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1995 May;46(1-2):181-94. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(94)07017-2.,,['Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Sep;53(1-2):191-2.

Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals.

CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4+ lymphocyte counts. CD8+ lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8(high)) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8(low)) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.","['Hofmann-Lehmann, R', 'Holznagel, E', 'Aubert, A', 'Ossent, P', 'Reinacher, M', 'Lutz, H']","['Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Holznagel E', 'Aubert A', 'Ossent P', 'Reinacher M', 'Lutz H']","['Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio/veterinary', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Male', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vaccination/*veterinary', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology', 'Viremia/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(94)07012-V [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(94)07012-v [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1995 May;46(1-2):127-37. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(94)07012-v.,,,,,,,PMC7119625,,,,,,,

METHODS: The investigation is a retrospective cohort study. All employees with possible exposure to chemical, pharmacological, or biological agents and employment for at least six months at the company during 1960-1990 were included. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated with the local county population as reference. RESULTS: The total cancer incidence was close to the expected. In a subcohort consisting of the highest exposed employees, an SIR of 3.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.5-6.8] was found for urothelial tumors, while there were no urothelial tumors among the workers with the lowest exposure. An evaluation of the exposures among the subjects with urothelial tumors revealed no association with specific exposures in the workplaces. There was also a statistically significant increase in the risk for acute leukemia (SIR 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-12 ). With a 10-year induction-latency period in the calculations, the elevated risk was smaller and not significant. Although the numbers were small, there were also statistically significant overrisks for cancer of the peritoneum, the lip, and the pleura. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the risk for urothelial tumors was found among pharmaceutical workers. All but one of those with urothelial tumors were smokers, but confounding from smoking could probably not explain the risk increase.","['Edling, C', 'Friis, L', 'Mikoczy, Z', 'Hagmar, L', 'Lindfors, P']","['Edling C', 'Friis L', 'Mikoczy Z', 'Hagmar L', 'Lindfors P']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cohort Studies', '*Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Urologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['18 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1995 Apr;21(2):116-23. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purine metabolism enzyme activities were compared with membrane immunophenotype and cytochemical stains. CML subtypes were correlated with the expression of surface membrane antigens detected by the monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of immunophenotyping we found the following characteristic marker profiles: In stable phase of CML (CML-SP)-CD15, CD11b, CDw65, CD13, in accelerated phase of CML (CML-AP)-CD15, CDw65, CD11b, CD13 and CD33, in myeloid blastic phase of CML(CML-BP-M)-CD13, CD33, HLA-DR, CD11b, CD15, CDw65, in myeloid and lymphoid (mixed) blastic phase of CML (CML-BP-M+L)-CD13, CD33, CD34, HLA-DR, CD11b, CD10 and in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-CD14, CDw65, CD11b, CD33 and HLA-DR. Analysis of purine metabolism enzyme activities showed that there was a correlation between the values of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and various types of CML. ADA levels in CML-SP, CML-AP and CMML were comparable with those in normal cells. In CML-BP-M, which represents proliferation of less mature myeloid cells (similar to less mature AML subtypes), ADA activity increased and PNP activity decreased. ADA activity was significantly different between control group and CML-BP-M (p < 0.01), between CML-SP and CML-BP-M (p < 0.05). The values of PNP activity were the highest in stable phase of CML (125 pkat. 10(-6) cells) and the lowest (23 pkat.10(-6) cells) in CML-BP-M+L. PNP activity in the other groups corresponded to control values. High ADA/PNP ratio was found in CML-BP-M and CML-BP-M+L (0.7 and 2.0, respectively) in comparison to CML-SP (0.2). It follows from our results that ADA/PNP ratio enables to discriminate between stable and blast phases of CML (p < 0.01). The level of the cytochemical enzymes (CHAE, MPO, SBB, ANAE and 5' NT) varied and reflected the degree of cell differentiation and maturation. CHAE and MPO were characteristic enzymes for CML, ANBE for CMML and 5' NT for CML-BP-lymphoid.","['Mesarosova, A', 'Hrivnakova, A', 'Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O']","['Mesarosova A', 'Hrivnakova A', 'Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'Purines/*metabolism']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1995;42(1):9-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antimicrotubule agents (which disrupt or block the formation of microtubules) are among the most widely used anticancer drugs and have contributed to the curative therapy of many neoplasms. Recently, two new antimicrotubule agents, vinorelbine tartrate (Navelbine) and paclitaxel (Taxol) have demonstrated clinical activity against ovarian, breast, and non-small-cell lung carcinomas. These agents target microtubules at different sites, and they both interfere with mitotic spindle function. Since vinorelbine tartrate and paclitaxel have shown a similar antitumor profile in clinical trials thus far, it is reasonable to expect that they may be used interchangeably in some combination therapies or perhaps with each other in the same treatment regimen. PURPOSE: On the basis of their similar activity profile in clinical trials, we decided to investigate the therapeutic outcome of a vinorelbine tartrate and paclitaxel binary drug combination, even though they appeared to have overlapping toxic effects. We wanted to ascertain the effect of this binary drug combination, in an in vivo setting, as it related to host toxicity and antitumor activity. METHODS: CDF-1 female mice that were implanted intraperitoneally with one million P388 murine leukemia cells were treated intraperitoneally with vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel, or a combination of the two drugs on a day-1, -5, and -9 dosing schedule. Experimental groups had between five and eight mice per group. Vinorelbine tartrate was administered at either 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 mg/kg and paclitaxel at either 4.5, 18, or 36 mg/kg. RESULTS: As single agents, neither vinorelbine tartrate nor paclitaxel generated meaningful numbers of 60-day cures (i.e., tumor free at day 60). In contrast, optimal combination regimens produced 60-day cures in more than 80% of the mice. The LD10 (dose lethal to 10% of the mice) of vinorelbine tartrate increased approximately 2.5-fold in the presence of paclitaxel and allowed otherwise lethal vinorelbine tartrate doses to be administered safely, which may have contributed to the antitumor efficacy of the combinations. The effect of the time delay between vinorelbine tartrate and paclitaxel administration on toxicity and cures appeared to be contingent on the vinorelbine tartrate dose. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the overlapping toxic effects of vinorelbine tartrate and paclitaxel might not be a deterrent to their use in combination drug therapy.

LIF binding to myometrium was moderate in oestrous and non-oestrous animals and on day 1 of pregnancy, declined on days 2 and 3, and increased to a peak value on days 5 and 6 of pregnancy. Binding to stromal cells was not observed. Binding of LIF to luminal and glandular epithelium was low in unmated animals and on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy. Binding to luminal epithelium increased from day 3, and to glandular epithelium from day 5 of pregnancy. Highest binding was seen on days 5 and 6, with a slight decline observed on day 7, and with little difference between the mesometrial and antimesometrial regions of the implantation site. In all cases, binding of LIF was similar in the uteri of day 6 pseudopregnant and pregnant animals. At all stages, gp130 was absent from stroma and almost absent from myometrium and glandular epithelium. It was expressed in luminal epithelium, reaching maximal expression on day 6 of pregnancy and pseudopregnancy, but diminished on day 7 of pregnancy, particularly in the antimesometrial area of the implantation site. The coexpression of LIF binding and gp130 may indicate the presence of high-affinity LIF receptor, which matches the pattern of LIF protein expression and, as in mice, suggests its importance for implantation.","['Yang, Z M', 'Le, S P', 'Chen, D B', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Harper, M J']","['Yang ZM', 'Le SP', 'Chen DB', 'Yasukawa K', 'Harper MJ']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Reprod Fertil,Journal of reproduction and fertility,0376367,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Embryonic Development', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Estrus/metabolism', 'Female', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Myometrium/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/jrf.0.1030249 [doi]'],ppublish,J Reprod Fertil. 1995 Mar;103(2):249-55. doi: 10.1530/jrf.0.1030249.,,,"['HD 07495/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 14048/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We thus tested the effects on VAChT gene expression of the cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and retinoic acid, both of which induce ChAT activity and increase ChAT mRNA levels in cultured sympathetic neurons. These factors increased both the number of binding sites for vesamicol, a specific ligand of VAChT, and VAChT immunoreactivity. This increase in the number of VAChT molecules resulted from an increase in the amount of VAChT mRNA, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR and which paralleled that of ChAT mRNAs. These data suggest a functional role for ChAT and VAChT gene organization and are consistent with the existence of a coregulatory mechanism for the embedded ChAT and VAChT genes.","['Berrard, S', 'Varoqui, H', 'Cervini, R', 'Israel, M', 'Mallet, J', 'Diebler, M F']","['Berrard S', 'Varoqui H', 'Cervini R', 'Israel M', 'Mallet J', 'Diebler MF']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire de la Neurotransmission et des Processus Neurodegeneratifs, CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc18a3 protein, rat)', '0 (Vesicular Acetylcholine Transport Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Vesicular Acetylcholine Transport Proteins', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1995.65020939.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1995 Aug;65(2):939-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1995.65020939.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They lower the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer and sulindac reduces the number and size of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. We studied the effect of sulindac, and its metabolite sulindac sulfide, on the proliferation of HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. Both compounds reduced the proliferation rate of these cells, changed their morphology, and caused them to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These responses were time- and concentration-dependent and reversible. In addition, these compounds reduced the level and activity of several cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which regulate cell cycle progression. Sulindac and sulindac sulfide also induced apoptosis in these cells at concentrations that affected their proliferation, morphology, and cell cycle phase distribution.

Our results indicate that inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptotic cell death contribute to the anti-proliferative effects of sulindac and sulindac sulfide in HT-29 cells.

In this study, the biosynthesis and glycosylation of hepatic gp130 were investigated using a specific polyclonal antibody to the 287 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of gp130. Immunoprecipitation and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrate, in addition to a mature surface expressed gp130, the presence of a major immature form of the molecule within the cell. The immature form can shift to become a functional gp130 only after being terminally glycosylated. The kinetics of gp130 maturation and surface expression were determined. When both forms of gp130 are deglycosylated the resulting core peptides migrate to identical positions in a denatured protein gel, indicating that the principal difference between the two forms resides in the extent of their glycosylation. IL-6 and other members of this cytokine family activate only the mature form, demonstrating its location at the membrane surface. Protein and mRNA turnover studies reveal gp130 to be a stable, slowly renewing population under nonstimulated conditions. These findings provide novel information on the intracellular events leading to the expression of this critically important signal transducing protein.","['Wang, Y', 'Fuller, G M']","['Wang Y', 'Fuller GM']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', '*Antigens, CD', 'Autoradiography', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240570405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1995 Apr;57(4):610-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240570405.,,,['HL-43155/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This domain specifically interacted with several cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins. We have purified these APP RNA-binding proteins from a human T-cell leukemia and demonstrate that five cytoplasmic proteins of 70, 48, 47, 39, and 38 kDa form the previously observed APP RNA protein complexes. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins were fragments of nucleolin and that the 39- and 38-kDa proteins were heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C protein. Northwestern and Western blot analyses of purified material further confirmed these data. Nucleolin protein is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm but hnRNP C has not been reported within the cytoplasm.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible involvement of a cell-mediated suppression of granulopoiesis in these patients. We studied two groups of patients, 8 neutropenic and 26 non-neutropenic, defined by the arbitrarily taken cutoff count of 2000 neutrophils/microliters. We found that neutropenic patients had higher numbers of peripheral blood CD3+, CD8+ and CD57+ cells, and higher numbers of activated CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells than the non-neutropenic ones. A negative correlation between CD8+ cells and circulating neutrophils, and a suggested negative correlation between CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells and circulating neutrophils were noted in the patients studied. Furthermore, we investigated the capacity of immunomagnetically isolated CD8+ cells to inhibit in vitro colony formation by normal granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and we found that inhibition was more pronounced when CD8+ cells, added in the culture, were derived from neutropenic than from non-neutropenic patients. The degree of colony inhibition correlated with the number of circulating neutrophils and the numbers of CD8+ and CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells in the patients studied. Since tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been reported to be involved in myelosuppression, we also investigated the capacity of isolated CD8+ cells to release this cytokine into the culture supernatant fluids, and we found that comparable amounts of TNF-alpha were produced after stimulation in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. Elevated serum TNF-alpha concentrations were noted only in a number of neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. All these data taken together provide strong evidence that a T-cell subpopulation of activated CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of neutropenia, at least in a subset of B-CLL patients, suppressing myelopoiesis by a TNF-alpha-unrelated mechanism. Efforts to isolate this cell subpopulation by flow cytometry for further analysis and a better understanding of its effect on myelopoiesis in patients with B-CLL are in progress in our laboratory.","['Katrinakis, G', 'Kyriakou, D', 'Alexandrakis, M', 'Sakellariou, D', 'Foudoulakis, A', 'Eliopoulos, G D']","['Katrinakis G', 'Kyriakou D', 'Alexandrakis M', 'Sakellariou D', 'Foudoulakis A', 'Eliopoulos GD']","['Division of Haematology, University of Crete School of Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb00230.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1995 Jul;55(1):33-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb00230.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to studies of residential exposure to magnetic fields, occupational studies include electric and magnetic field exposures and have much greater variability in field intensity, frequency, and temporal patterns. Studies of leukemia in electrical workers show a moderate consistency, with elevated risk ratios of 1.2 to 2.0 commonly observed. Brain tumors are similarly elevated with some consistency, and three recent studies have suggested increased risk of male breast cancer. Retrospective exposure assessment methods were advanced in recent studies of diverse occupations in a study in central Sweden, which yielded evidence of increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among men in more highly exposed occupations. A study of telephone workers in New York State incorporated measurements and found some indication of increased leukemia risk only when exposures were based on historical technology. Utility workers in southern California were studied and found not to have increased risks of leukemia and brain cancer based on exposures estimated with measurements. An ongoing study of electric utility workers at five companies in the United States incorporates an extensive measurement protocol. Randomly selected workers within occupational categories wore a time-integrating magnetic-field meter to provide estimates of exposure for the occupational category. We were able to estimate and partition the variance into between-day (the largest contributor), within occupational categories, and between occupational categories. Principal research needs concern optimal levels of worker aggregation for exposure assignment, historical extrapolation, study of diverse work environments, and integration of residential and occupational exposure in the same study.","['Savitz, D A']",['Savitz DA'],"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.95103s269 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1995 Mar;103 Suppl 2:69-74. doi: 10.1289/ehp.95103s269.,,,,,,19,PMC1518850,,,,,,,

From first being of a simple pilot character, the designs have become increasingly sophisticated, especially with regard to exposure assessment. Crude exposure estimates based on type of house, building material and geological features have been supplemented or replaced by quite extensive measurements. Still, exposure assessment remains a difficult and uncertain issue in these studies, most of which indicate a lung cancer risk from indoor radon. Also a recent large scale study has confirmed a lung cancer risk from indoor radon. More recently there are also some studies, mainly of the correlation type, suggesting other cancers also to be related to indoor radon, especially leukemia, kidney cancer, and malignant melanoma, and some other cancers as well.

Methods are required for removing malignant cells from harvested bone marrow (BM) without impairing hematopoietic reconstitution. We have shown that simvastatin is toxic to leukemic progenitor cells at a concentration that conserves normal BM progenitors and may be of use clinically as a novel BM purging agent. METHODS: A two-stage culture system was used to compare the effects of simvastatin on both normal BM progenitor and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. AML cells and normal BM mononuclear cells were incubated for 18 hours in suspension culture with 10 micrograms per mL simvastatin and the numbers of surviving clonogenic progenitor cells assayed in semisolid agar culture. RESULTS: Following simvastatin treatment of 18 AML cell populations, the mean surviving fraction of progenitor cells was 21.3 +/- 4.8% ( +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). In contrast, the mean survival of normal BM progenitors from 16 donors was 89.6 +/- 8.6% ( +/- SEM). Samples were taken from 6 AML patients before treatment and after remission of disease had been induced by chemotherapy. In 5 of these cases the AML sample was significantly more sensitive to simvastatin than the remission sample, 4 of the 5 showed > 80% difference in progenitor cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: AML progenitor cells are sensitive to a short-term exposure to simvastatin that spares normal BM hematopoietic progenitor cells. We conclude that simvastatin may be an effective in vitro purging agent in ABMT for AML.","['Newman, A', 'Clutterbuck, R D', 'DeLord, C', 'Powles, R L', 'Catovsky, D', 'Millar, J L']","['Newman A', 'Clutterbuck RD', 'DeLord C', 'Powles RL', 'Catovsky D', 'Millar JL']","['Section of Academic Haematology, Sutton, Surrey, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Simvastatin', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Investig Med. 1995 Jun;43(3):269-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the peripheral nervous system, high levels of the enzyme are present in all neonatal and early postnatal Schwann cells, while as myelination proceeds it is gradually suppressed in the majority of cells that form myelin but retained in non-myelin-forming cells in the adult animal. In the present study we have investigated the effects of transection, crush and regeneration of the adult rat sciatic nerve on the expression of the endopeptidase by Schwann cells in situ. Endopeptidase-24.11 was monitored by immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal anti-endopeptidase antibody 23B11. For comparison, a parallel study was carried out with a monoclonal antibody directed against the rat nerve growth factor receptor. We found that (i) all Schwann cells of the distal segment re-expressed endopeptidase-24.11 as early as 4 days after axotomy, the level of immunostaining reaching a maximum after 2 weeks, (ii) axonal regeneration repressed Schwann cell expression of endopeptidase-24.11, and (iii) the induction of the nerve growth factor receptor followed a similar pattern to that of endopeptidase-24.11 in the transected and crushed nerve. Enzymatic amplification of endopeptidase-24.11 cDNA from normal and axotomized adult rat sciatic nerve confirmed the expression of endopeptidase-24.11 in these tissues. Our results show that the expression of endopeptidase-24.11 in Schwann cells, as is the case with the nerve growth factor receptor, is induced by the loss of the normal axon-Schwann cell contact. The significant increase in the expression of endopeptidase-24.11 by Schwann cells after axonal damage suggests that the enzyme could play a role in axonal regeneration.","['Kioussi, C', 'Mamalaki, A', 'Jessen, K', 'Mirsky, R', 'Hersh, L B', 'Matsas, R']","['Kioussi C', 'Mamalaki A', 'Jessen K', 'Mirsky R', 'Hersh LB', 'Matsas R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nerve Regeneration', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/immunology', 'Schwann Cells/metabolism', 'Sciatic Nerve/*metabolism']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb01083.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1995 May 1;7(5):951-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb01083.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance remains the major obstacle in this disease, although relatively little data are available on the correlation of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and clinical outcome. We examined 28 bone marrow samples from 24 patients with AML. The MDR1 RNA levels were determined by slot blot analysis. The incidence of positive expression of MDR1 mRNA in patients was 64.7% in samples from newly-diagnosed patients and 85.7% in relapse samples. The overall complete remission rate was 45%. However, the complete remission rate was lower for patients in the MDR1 RNA positive group than in the negative group. In three cases, the MDR1 RNA expression steadily rose during the period of disease progression and after several courses of chemotherapy. We suggest that a high frequency of MDR1 gene expression in patients with AML and higher MDR1 RNA levels are associated with a lower incidence of complete remission as well as a shorter disease-free time. The expression of MDR1 is a poor prognostic factor for AML treatment and it may play an important role in resistance to chemotherapy.","['Lin, S F', 'Huang, S M', 'Chen, T P', 'Chang, C S', 'Liu, T C', 'Wang, S J', 'Liu, H W']","['Lin SF', 'Huang SM', 'Chen TP', 'Chang CS', 'Liu TC', 'Wang SJ', 'Liu HW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital, Taiwan R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1995 Mar;94(3):111-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In DNA mobility shift assays, this sequence can give either six different specific bands which are competed out by different parts of the sequence or one specific band which is competed out by each of the inverted repeats, depending on the reconstitution conditions. In different genes, the core sequences are separated by integer numbers of helical turns.

As controls, PDE scrambled and PS sense and scrambled sequences and a probe antisense to a 3' portion of the coding sequence were used. Treatment with PDE-ODNs did not alter the core protein content of cell or culture medium proteoglycans. Treatment with all the PS-ODNs resulted in loss of the 31 kD serglycin core protein in the medium, but not the cell-associated proteoglycans, and concomitant appearance of a heavily labeled core protein band at the dye front. This band appears to arise from truncation of the core protein, which leaves the glycosaminoglycan attachment region intact. The higher molecular weight core proteins, which appear to be derived from a betaglycan-like proteoglycan, were not affected by the PDE or PS-ODN treatment. The same effect was seen with or without electroporation, which was used to enhance uptake of the ODNs. Thus treatment of megakaryocytic tumor cells with PS-ODNs appeared to cause a selective degradation of the serglycin core protein in a sequence-independent manner. Degradation most likely occurred intracellularly, because culture supernatants did not degrade exogenously added serglycin proteoglycan, and the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the culture medium during exposure of the cells to the PS-ODNs did not prevent the degradation.","['Schick, B P', 'Eras, J L', 'Mintz, P S']","['Schick BP', 'Eras JL', 'Mintz PS']","['Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antisense Res Dev,Antisense research and development,9110698,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (serglycin)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Codon', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*biosynthesis/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', '*Thionucleotides', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ard.1995.5.59 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Res Dev. 1995 Spring;5(1):59-65. doi: 10.1089/ard.1995.5.59.,,,['R01 HL29282/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Poor delivery to the designated site of action of antisense oligonucleotides is a major problem limiting their routine use in genetic research and their development as potential therapeutic agents. In view of this difficulty, various means of membrane permeabilization were applied to cultured human leukemia cells in an attempt to enhance intracytoplasmic delivery of fluorescein-tagged oligodeoxynucleotides. The outcome of the manipulations was monitored by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. This work has directly confirmed the conclusion suggested by reported antisense effects, that streptolysin O reversibly permeabilizes the plasma membrane toward oligonucleotides and may be utilized to effect biochemical ""microinjection"" of these molecules directly into the cytoplasm.

This review summarizes the results of studies of the occurrence of the individual types of cancer in dry cleaners. Two of those cancers of greatest a priori concern (because of results in PCE-exposed experimental animals)--liver cancer and leukemia--have not occurred with increased frequency among persons employed in the dry-cleaning industry. Rates were elevated by about a factor of two for esophageal and bladder cancers, but not increased clearly for any other site. The excess mortality from esophageal cancer was well beyond the limits of chance, based on a total of 23 deaths that occurred in the two principal cohort-studies of dry cleaners. There was some indication of a particularly high risk associated with prolonged employment and a long interval since first employment. However, the possible confounding effect of the combination of cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, a very strong risk factor for the development of esophageal cancer, could be taken into account only partially in these studies. With regard to bladder cancer, the limited data available suggest that the observed increased risk could be due to exposure to other solvents than PCE used in dry cleaning. The potential influence of occupational exposure to PCE on the occurrence of esophageal and bladder cancer needs continued examination in further follow-up of existing cohorts of dry cleaners, the assembly of additional cohorts, and in large case-control studies that ascertain occupational exposures in some detail.","['Weiss, N S']",['Weiss NS'],"['University of Washington, Department of Epidemiology, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['TJ904HH8SN (Tetrachloroethylene)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Laundering', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Tetrachloroethylene/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00051797 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1995 May;6(3):257-66. doi: 10.1007/BF00051797.,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have further investigated the relationship between the human complement cascade and retrovirus inactivation. Preincubation in normal human serum effectively inactivated LXSN retroviral vector particles, whereas the vector maintained the ability to transduce cells following incubation in sera deficient in either the C1, C2, C3, C5, C6, C8, or C9 human complement proteins. Preincubation of serum with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that functionally block specific complement components, including C5, C6, C8, and C9, successfully protected the LXSN vector from complement-mediated inactivation. Treatment of serum with cobra venom factor, which consumes terminal complement, also effectively protected the vector from inactivation. LXSN vector survival in serum corresponded inversely to the level of complement activity following treatment of serum with anti-C5 mAb as assessed in an erythrocyte hemolytic assay. Additionally, pretreatment of human whole blood with anti-C5 mAb effectively inhibited inactivation of the LXSN vector. Taken together, these data demonstrate that formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) is required for the inactivation of the murine-based LXSN retroviral vector in human blood and that this process can be abrogated with the use of soluble complement inhibitors.","['Rother, R P', 'Squinto, S P', 'Mason, J M', 'Rollins, S A']","['Rother RP', 'Squinto SP', 'Mason JM', 'Rollins SA']","['Department of Molecular Development, Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., New Haven, CT 06511, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complement C5)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (cobra venom factor)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Complement C5/immunology', 'Complement Inactivator Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/deficiency', 'Elapid Venoms/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/*blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1995.6.4-429 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1995 Apr;6(4):429-35. doi: 10.1089/hum.1995.6.4-429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase activity, it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins. In the present experiment, we examined the effect of nm23 proteins on various differentiation induction systems of human leukemic cells including HL-60, U937, HEL/S, KU812F, K562, and HEL cells. Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL, KU812 and K562 cells, but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60, U937 and HEL/S cells. The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23-H1, -H2, mouse nm23-M1, and -M2 proteins. Moreover, both the mutant nm23-H2His protein and truncated nm23-H2 protein containing N-terminal (1-60) peptide, which do not have NDP kinase activity, also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells. These results suggest that (1) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I-factor/nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells, (2) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity, and (3) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23/NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides.","['Okabe-Kado, J', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Baba, H', 'Urano, T', 'Shiku, H', 'Honma, Y']","['Okabe-Kado J', 'Kasukabe T', 'Baba H', 'Urano T', 'Shiku H', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nme1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1995/06/20 00:00,1995/06/20 00:01,['1995/06/20 00:00'],"['1995/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(95)00037-S [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(95)00037-s [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Jun 20;1267(2-3):101-6. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(95)00037-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients were given oral busulfan 4 mg/kg/day for 4 days and IV cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow purged with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Five of 35 patients developed clinical evidence of acute cholecystitis, manifested by fever, nausea, vomiting, right-upper-quadrant pain, and abdominal guarding, within 18 days after autologous bone marrow infusion. Ultrasonography and CT scans of the abdomen supported the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Three patients underwent cholecystectomy, while two patients were treated medically; all recovered uneventfully. A review of 338 consecutive bone marrow transplant patients who underwent marrow transplantation for a variety of diseases and were treated with other high-dose cytotoxic regimens during the same time period revealed significantly fewer cases of cholecystitis, i.e. two, (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Five of 35 AML patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplant using busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and purged bone marrow developed evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Its etiology is unknown, and no relationship with viruses or genes has been demonstrated. Epidemiological data suggest that genetic and ambiental factors might be of some significance. Clinical features of CLL are due to the accumulation of leukemic cells in bone marrow and lymphoid organs as well as the immune disturbances that accompany the disease. The prognosis of patients with CLL varies. Treatment is usually indicated by the risk of the individual patient, which is clearly reflected by the stage of the disease. In the early stage (Binet A, Rai O) it is reasonable to defer therapy until disease progression is observed. By contrast, because their median survival is less than five years, patients with more advanced stages require therapy. For almost 50 years, no major advances in the management of CLL, which has revolved around the use of alkylating agents, have been made. In recent years, the therapeutic approach in patients with CLL has changed as a result of the introduction of combination chemotherapy regimens and, in particular, purine analogues. The latter are already the treatment of choice for patients not responding to standard therapies, and their role as front-line therapy is being investigated. Bone marrow transplants are also being increasingly used. It is to be hoped that in years to come the outcome of patients with CLL will be improved by these advances.","['Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Hematology Farreras Valenti, Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059151 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61160-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Mar;6(3):219-35. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059151.,,,,,,228,,,,,,,,

Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 373, 581-588). In the paper presented here, results from further characterization experiments as well as from studies on the effects of proteolysis on the conformation and the resulting functional properties of the truncated inhibitor are reported. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that proteolysis has occurred in the N-terminal part as well as in the reactive site loop of alpha 1-PI. The resulting core protein of 41 kDa is composed of approximately 324 amino acid residues with the C-terminus located close to Lys343 of alpha 1-PI.A 4 kDa peptide remaining bound to this fragment throughout the entire purification procedure could be separated by SDS treatment. N- and C-terminal sequence analysis of this peptide after isolation by gel filtration showed that it is comprised of residues Ile359 up to Lys394, thus representing the peptide located C-terminal to the reactive site loop of alpha 1-PI. Transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis indicates that the proteolyzed inhibitor is in the thermodynamically stable, relaxed (R)-conformation known for proteinase-complexed and cleaved serpins. The truncated inhibitor exhibits no chemotactic activity towards neutrophils when tested in a standard assay.","['Dengler, R', 'Lottspeich, F', 'Oberthur, W', 'Mast, A E', 'Emmerich, B']","['Dengler R', 'Lottspeich F', 'Oberthur W', 'Mast AE', 'Emmerich B']","['Medizinische Klinik im Klinikum Innenstadt, Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler,Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler,8503054,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Urea/chemistry', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/chemistry/*metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/bchm3.1995.376.3.165 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler. 1995 Mar;376(3):165-72. doi: 10.1515/bchm3.1995.376.3.165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial ground currents are most often found in homes having conductive plumbing, in which an uninterrupted metallic path in the water pipes and water main connects the grounding systems of neighboring houses. Information on plumbing conductivity was obtained from water suppliers for the homes of 347 cases and 277 controls identified in an earlier study of magnetic field exposure and childhood cancer in the Denver area. An increased cancer risk was observed for children in homes with conductive plumbing: The matched odds ratio was 1.72 (1.03-2.88) and increased to 3.00 (1.33-6.76) when analysis was limited to cases and controls who were residentially stable from the reference date to the study date. A measurement metric likely to indicate active ground currents (measurements having above-median intensity and a nonvertical orientation of < 55 degrees from the horizontal) was identified. In contrast to measured field intensity alone, for which only modest associations with cancer have been reported, this metric shows a high and significant cancer risk [matched O.R. = 4.0 (1.6-10.0)] consistent over a range of intensity and angle cutpoints. Such elevated nonvertical fields were also associated with cancer in an independent data set, which was gathered to study adult nonlymphocytic leukemia in the Seattle area.

The purpose of these studies was to determine whether ozone induces either spontaneous physiological degranulation or enhanced immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated degranulation of mast cells, thus accounting for the in vivo effects noted in asthmatics. A rat mast cell line (RBL-2H3) was exposed to different levels of ozone (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm), covered by different amounts of buffer, and both cytotoxic and nontoxic exposure conditions were determined. In addition to cytotoxicity, spontaneous release of granule products and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) associated with ozone exposure were assessed. RBL-2H3 cells were also exposed to ozone under noncytotoxic conditions followed by stimulation with alpha-IgE to cross-link membrane-bound IgE and A23187 so that the effect of ozone on stimulated degranulation could be examined. Only exposure conditions associated with cytotoxicity were associated with spontaneous release of mast cell serotonin, indicating no physiologic degranulation due to ozone exposure. Data presented herein also demonstrate that ozone substantially inhibited both IgE- and A23187-induced degranulation. Neither catalase nor superoxide dismutase protected cells from the inhibitory effect of ozone, indicating that ozone does not act through generation of H2O2 or superoxide. Additionally, ozone caused a modest increase in spontaneous PGD2 generation only under cytotoxic conditions. Thus ozone appears to inhibit mast cell degranulation after IgE- or A23187-mediated stimulation and causes direct release of mast cell granule products and PGD2 only under conditions associated with membrane cytotoxicity.","['Peden, D B', 'Dailey, L']","['Peden DB', 'Dailey L']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '66H7ZZK23N (Ozone)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/physiopathology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ozone/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajplung.1995.268.6.L902 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1995 Jun;268(6 Pt 1):L902-10. doi: 10.1152/ajplung.1995.268.6.L902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of Fe(II) salts to calcein-loaded human erythroleukemia K-562 cells elicited a slow quenching response that was markedly accelerated by the ionophore A-23187 and was reversed by membrane-permeant but not by impermeant chelators. These observations were confirmed by fluorescence imaging of cells. Other divalent metals such as Co(II), Ni(II), and Mn(II) permeated into cells at roughly similar rates, and their uptake, like that of Fe(II), was blocked by trifluoperazine, bepridil, and impermeant sulfhydryl-reactive organomercurials, indicating the operation of a common transport mechanism.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and imaging examinations of 20 pediatric patients (ages 1 to 15 years) with intracranial neoplasia in whom delayed intracranial hemorrhage developed after cranial irradiation or radiation combined with systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage from other identifiable causes were excluded. Histopathologic analysis was available in four patients. RESULTS: Twenty patients with delayed intracranial hemorrhage received cranial irradiation alone (n = 9) or combined radiation and chemotherapy (n = 11) for primary brain tumors (n = 13), leukemia (n = 6), or lymphoma (n = 1). Imaging findings were consistent with hemorrhages of varying ages. The hemorrhages were not associated with tumor recurrence nor second tumors. Except for location of the hemorrhage, no significant relationship was established between outcome and original diagnosis, radiation dose (range, 1800 to 6000 centigray), chemotherapeutic agent or dosage, age at treatment, or interval between therapy and hemorrhage (mean, 8.1 years). Only brain stem hemorrhage was associated with a poor outcome. CONCLUSION: In children with central nervous system neoplasia who have undergone cranial irradiation, or radiation combined with chemotherapy, delayed intracranial hemorrhage may develop.","['Poussaint, T Y', 'Siffert, J', 'Barnes, P D', 'Pomeroy, S L', 'Goumnerova, L C', 'Anthony, D C', 'Sallan, S E', 'Tarbell, N J']","['Poussaint TY', 'Siffert J', 'Barnes PD', 'Pomeroy SL', 'Goumnerova LC', 'Anthony DC', 'Sallan SE', 'Tarbell NJ']","[""Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

The pathological changes in ACA presumably result from a chronic T-cell-mediated tissue injury with atrophy or sclerosis of connective tissue.

We used the Michaelis-Menten model for calculating dosing rates under steady-state conditions. We determined a Michaelis-Menten constant of about 0.3 micrograms/ml from the data of two publications and from our own investigations. From the steady-state concentrations we calculated the necessary amount for the realization of a desired concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml. The interindividual differences and intraindividual changes of the pharmacokinetics were high (median: 6.9 mg/kg/d (2.7-17.1), n = 110). The intraindividual stability of the pharmacokinetics of repeatedly investigated patients (n = 20, individual time of observation: 4 to 296 days, median: 30 d) depended on various pathophysiological factors of influence. The individual duration of pharmacokinetically stable periods in relation to the respective observation time ranged between 0 and 100% (median: 75%, n = 23). In the initial days of treatment the course of itraconazole concentrations in repeatedly investigated patients (n = 6) was not uniform. Under constant dosage only one patient showed the increase in concentrations described in the literature during the first week of treatment. In this period of treatment probably three pharmacokinetic processes overlap one another: the establishment of the steady state, and systematic changes as well as changes caused by pathophysiological factors of the underlying disease. The development of therapeutic drug monitoring (with the calculation of the needed dosages) was unproblematic with the use of standard procedures. Necessity and frequency of therapeutic drug monitoring depend on the accepted ranges of concentration during long-term therapy, on the expected deviation of the pharmacokinetics during the course of the basic illness of the individual patient and on potential drug interactions.","['Lampe, D', 'Kreutzberg, S', 'Prumke, H J']","['Lampe D', 'Kreutzberg S', 'Prumke HJ']","['Krankenhaus im Friedrichshain, Fachbereich Klinische Toxikologie, Berlin, BR Deutschland.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,['304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mycoses. 1994;37 Suppl 2:34-9.,,,,,,,,Therapeutisches Drug-Monitoring von Itraconazol--ein Erfahrungsbericht.,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), known as a human homolog of thioredoxin, has been shown to be induced by a variety of stresses. In this study we examined ADF expression in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage cells after canine lung transplantation to determine whether it could be induced by allogenic stimulations and could be used to diagnose early rejection. Allotransplantations were performed in adult mongrel dogs, and immunosuppression was performed from the day of operation to the fifth postoperative day. No immunosuppressant was given from the sixth to the tenth postoperative days. Animals were put to death on the tenth postoperative day. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on the fifth and tenth postoperative days, and the lavage cells and lung tissues were examined immunohistochemically with anti-ADF antibody. The grades of rejection were as follows: grade 1 in two animals, grade 2 in three animals, and grade 3 in two animals. The percentages of ADF high-producer cells in bronchoalveolar lavage cells on the fifth and tenth postoperative days were 4.29% +/- 2.65% and 26.6% +/- 3.99%, respectively (p < 0.01). The percentages of ADF high-producer cells in normal healthy dogs and in those with grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 rejection were 3.00% +/- 1.64%, 20.5% +/- 9.00%, 25.5% +/- 6.06%, and 34.5% +/- 6.50%, respectively. The percentage in each rejection group was significantly higher than that in normal healthy dogs (p < 0.05). These results suggest that examination of bronchoalveolar lavage cells with ADF staining may be useful in the early diagnosis of rejection.","['Ono, N', 'Yokomise, H', 'Muro, K', 'Inui, K', 'Hitomi, S', 'Yodoi, J', 'Wada, H']","['Ono N', 'Yokomise H', 'Muro K', 'Inui K', 'Hitomi S', 'Yodoi J', 'Wada H']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chest Disease Research Institute, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*chemistry/cytology', 'Bronchoscopy', '*Cytokines', 'Dogs', 'Graft Rejection/*pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Transplantation/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Thioredoxins/*analysis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5223(05)80004-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0022-5223(05)80004-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1995 Jul;110(1):15-21. doi: 10.1016/S0022-5223(05)80004-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The full dose of the Japan adult leukemia study group (JALSG)-ALL90 protocol was given and consisted of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and predonisolone at the stage of CRF (serum creatinine concentration equal to/or less than 5.6 mg/dl). 2. The full dose of etoposide and 80% dose of cyclophosphamide, aclarubicin and vindesine used for consolidation therapy may be toxic when they are given after HD. 3. The dose of Enocitabine should be divided in every 12h in the context of toxicity to bone marrow and the mechanism of action.

Evi-2 is located within a large intron of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene, raising the possibility that proviral integration at Evi-2 predisposes mice to myeloid tumor development by disrupting Nf1 expression. This hypothesis is supported by data suggesting that mutations in the human NF1 gene are causally associated with the development of juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (K. M. Shannon, P. O'Connell, G. A. Martin, D. Paderanga, K. Olson, P. Dinndorf, and F. McCormick, N. Engl. J. Med. 330:597-601, 1994) and mouse studies showing that aged mice, heterozygous for a germ line Nf1 mutation, develop myeloid leukemia with loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele (T. Jacks, T. S. Shih, E. M. Schmitt, R. T. Bronson, A. Bernards, and R. A. Weinberg, Nat. Genet. 7:353-361, 1994). To determine if viral integration at Evi-2 disrupts Nf1 expression, we derived a series of BXH-2 myeloid leukemia cell lines with or without viral integrations at Evi-2. In all cell lines examined, viral integration at Evi-2 resulted in the production of only truncated Nf1 transcripts and no stable, full-length neurofibromin. Although neurofibromin is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras proteins, its loss in the BXH-2 leukemic cell lines was not correlated with an increased steady-state level of p21ras bound to GTP. These data suggest that neurofibromin is not the sole mediator of Ras-GAP activity in myeloid cells and may have a GAP-independent function in myeloid cells.","['Largaespada, D A', 'Shaughnessy, J D Jr', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Largaespada DA', 'Shaughnessy JD Jr', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (EVI2A protein, human)', '0 (Evi2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Probes', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Integration', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.8.5095-5102.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Aug;69(8):5095-102. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.8.5095-5102.1995.,,,['N01-C0-46000/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Evi-2', 'Nf1']",,,PMC189327,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 Tax1 gene product has been shown to transactivate transcription of viral and cellular promoters. To examine the biochemical mechanism of Tax1 transactivation, we have developed an in vitro transactivation assay in which wild-type Tax1 is able to specifically transactivate a polymerase II promoter through upstream Tax1-responsive elements. The in vitro system utilizes the HTLV-1 21-bp repeats cloned upstream of the ovalbumin promoter and G-free cassette. Purified Tax1 specifically transactivates this template 5- to 10-fold in a concentration-dependent manner. No transactivation of the ovalbumin promoter (pLovTATA) template control was observed. Tax1 transactivation was inhibited by low concentrations of alpha-amanitin and was effectively neutralized by anti-Tax1 but not control sera. Consistent with in vivo transactivating activity, Tax1 NF-kappa B mutant M22, but not cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein mutant M47, transactivated the template containing the tandem 21-bp repeat. In a reconstituted in vitro transcription assay, Tax1 transactivation was dependent upon basal transcription factors TFIIB, TFIIF, Pol II, TFIID, and TFIIA. TATA-binding protein did not functionally substitute for TFIID in the transactivation assay by Tax1 but was sufficient for basal transcription. Finally, we have used anti-TFIIA antibody (p55) to ask if Tax1 transactivation required TFIIA activity. Addition of TFIIA antibody to in vitro transcription reactions, as well as depletion of TFIIA by preclearing with antibody, showed that TFIIA was required for Tax1 transactivation. Only a slight (twofold) drop of basal transcription was observed. Tax1 transactivation was restored when purified HeLa TFIIA was added back into the reconstituted system. We propose that Tax1 utilizes a transactivation pathway involving the activator regulated basal transcription factors TFIID and TFIIA.","['Duvall, J F', 'Kashanchi, F', 'Cvekl, A', 'Radonovich, M F', 'Piras, G', 'Brady, J N']","['Duvall JF', 'Kashanchi F', 'Cvekl A', 'Radonovich MF', 'Piras G', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIIA)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spodoptera', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factor TFIIA', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.8.5077-5086.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Aug;69(8):5077-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.8.5077-5086.1995.,,,,,,,PMC189325,,,,,,,

All three binding sites (LVb, LVc, and core) are required for phorbol ester inducibility of the Mo-MLV enhancer. Adjacent binding sites for the ets and cbf proteins likewise constitute a phorbol ester response element within the human T-cell receptor beta-chain (TCR beta) enhancer and contribute to constitutive transcriptional activity of the TCR beta enhancer in T cells. Here we show that the CBF alpha subunit encoded by the mouse Cbfa2 gene (the murine homolog of human AML1) and three ets proteins, Ets-1, Ets-2, and GA-binding protein (GABP), transactivate both the Mo-MLV and mouse TCR beta enhancer in transient-expression assays. Moreover, we show that transactivation by Cbf alpha 2 requires both intact ets and cbf binding sites. Transactivation by Ets-1, Ets-2, and GABP likewise requires intact binding sites for ets proteins and CBF. Supportive biochemical analyses demonstrate that both proteins can bind simultaneously to a composite enhancer element.

All patients had received complete immunizations for measles, mumps, rubella, and poliovirus before ALL developed. They were challenged with Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and Pneumococcus vaccines after baseline serum samples were obtained. We also determined in vivo humoral immune responses to bacteria and viruses that cause common pediatric diseases. RESULTS: Compared with age-matched control subjects, the long-term survivors of ALL had a significant difference in the presence of protective antibodies to measles (p < 0.0001) and polioviruses (p < 0.0001) in their baseline sera; more than half had no protective antibodies to one or more previously administered vaccines or related infections. Most produced protective concentrations of specific antibody after reimmunization, but some were repeatedly unable to make protective antibodies, or mount a normal antibody response, despite natural disease and/or revaccination. Four children had significant infections.

Obesity at attainment of final height was defined as a BMI greater than the 85th percentile of the normal reference population. At final height 23 of 51 male (45%) and 30 of 63 female patients (47%) were obese. Girls became obese between diagnosis and the end of chemotherapy (p = 0.02), after which they had no further increase, indicating that chemotherapy may have played a role in their obesity. Boys had a progressive and gradual increase in BMI z score through to attainment of final height. Obesity did not appear to be associated with growth hormone insufficiency, disproportionate growth, or abnormal timing of puberty.

The disease is characterized by polyclonally activated CD4+ T cells and B cells. It is known that BM5def is expressed at highest levels in B lymphocytes and that B cells serve as viral antigen-presenting cells. Full and sustained activation of CD4+ T cells against a conventional Ag usually requires both TCR and costimulating signals. Among various molecules known to provide costimulatory function, the expression of CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) on MAIDS B cells was increased, whereas that of CD2, heat-stable Ag (CD24), CD80 (B7-1), and CD86 (B7-2) was unchanged from normal. C57BL/6 mice depleted of both CD54 and CD11a expression as a result of chronic administration of mAb had developed no MAIDS at 4 wk and 8 wk after LP-BM5 MuLV infection. In addition, the proliferative response of B cells to mitogen was well conserved, whereas MAIDS-associated increases in serum Ig levels were inhibited. Replication of BM5def was suppressed markedly in infected mice treated with the CD54 and CD11a mAbs. These results suggest that the CD54/CD11a signal transduction pathway is a critical determinant of MAIDS development, and the lack of an immune response against viral Ag is enough to suppress BM5def replication and to prevent MAIDS.","['Makino, M', 'Yoshimatsu, K', 'Azuma, M', 'Okada, Y', 'Hitoshi, Y', 'Yagita, H', 'Takatsu, K', 'Komuro, K']","['Makino M', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Azuma M', 'Okada Y', 'Hitoshi Y', 'Yagita H', 'Takatsu K', 'Komuro K']","['Department of Bacterial and Blood Products, National Institute of Health Japan, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Female', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/prevention & control', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/*virology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Jul 15;155(2):974-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of a Jak/STAT pathway in regulation of the adipose-specific promoter.,16449-57,"In the present report we describe a heretofore unrecognized role for a Jak/STAT signaling pathway, namely the stimulation of expression of the aromatase P450 (CYP19) gene, and hence of estrogen biosynthesis, in human adipose tissue. Expression of this gene in adipose tissue as well as in adipose stromal cells maintained in the presence of serum and glucocorticoids is regulated by a distal TATA-less promoter, I.4, which contains a glucocorticoid response element, an Sp1 binding site, and an interferon-gamma activation site (GAS) element. The stimulatory action of serum (in the presence of dexamethasone) can be replaced by interleukin (IL)-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin-M, as well as by IL-6, providing the IL-6 soluble receptor is also present. Stimulation of the cells by these factors led to rapid phosphorylation of Jak1, but not Jak2 or Jak3, on tyrosine residues. STAT3 but not STAT1 was also phosphorylated and bound to the GAS element in the I.4 promoter region. When regions of this promoter were fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into the cells, mutagenesis or deletion of the GAS element led to complete loss of reporter gene expression. Since adipose tissue is the major site of estrogen biosynthesis in men and in postmenopausal women, this pathway involving a Jak/STAT signaling mechanism acting together with glucocorticoids and Sp1 appears to be the principal means whereby estrogen biosynthesis is regulated in the elderly.","['Zhao, Y', 'Nichols, J E', 'Bulun, S E', 'Mendelson, C R', 'Simpson, E R']","['Zhao Y', 'Nichols JE', 'Bulun SE', 'Mendelson CR', 'Simpson ER']","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9051, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*physiology', 'Aromatase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1995/07/07 00:00,1995/07/07 00:01,['1995/07/07 00:00'],"['1995/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.27.16449 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)48883-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul 7;270(27):16449-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.27.16449.,,,['5-R37-AG08174/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],['CYP19'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that nuclear NFAT can be induced in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cell line and rat bone marrow-derived mast cells upon cross-linkage of the high affinity receptor (Fc epsilon RI) for immunoglobulin E (IgE). Receptor-dependent activation of NFAT was mimicked by the combination of the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. The induced binding activity was specific for the NFAT recognition motif because competition with nonradioactive NFAT oligonucleotide abolished the DNA binding activity, whereas nonradioactive oligonucleotides recognized by the transcription factors NF kappa B, glucocorticoid receptors, and TFIID did not. An oligonucleotide representing the AP-1 recognition sequence also blocked the NFAT DNA binding activity, as did a combination of anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, AP-1-binding proteins were found to be induced in RBL-2H3 cells under the same conditions as was the NFAT binding activity. Together these data suggest that the NFAT complex in mast cells contains Fos and Jun proteins as does NFAT in T-cells. The appearance of nuclear NFAT binding activity was dependent in part upon calcium mobilization, as buffering the antigen-induced calcium rise with intracellular BAPTA strongly inhibited NFAT activation. Prevention of calcium influx with external EGTA also inhibited NFAT activation, indicating that release of calcium from internal stores was insufficient for sustained activation of mast cell NFAT. Cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, blocked the induction of NFAT-DNA binding activity, implicating calcineurin as a key signaling enzyme in this pathway. These results suggest that NFAT is present in the mast cell line RBL-2H3 and in primary bone marrow-derived mast cells, is similar in subunit composition to the T-cell NFAT, and may play a role in calcium-dependent signal transduction in mast cells.","['Hutchinson, L E', 'McCloskey, M A']","['Hutchinson LE', 'McCloskey MA']","['Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames 50011, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",1995/07/07 00:00,1995/07/07 00:01,['1995/07/07 00:00'],"['1995/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.27.16333 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)48867-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul 7;270(27):16333-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.27.16333.,,,['GM48144/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have used isomers of 1,25(OH)2D3 to investigate the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its putative nuclear receptor (VDR) in NB4 cell monocytic differentiation. 1 beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (HL), a specific antagonist of only the nongenomic signals of 1,25(OH)2D3, attenuated the priming effect of 1,25(OH)2D3. The 6-cis conformer of 1,25(OH)2D3 (HF), which is unable to bind to VDR, was 20 times more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 as a priming agent for monocytic differentiation. This response was also blocked by the HL antagonist. Unlike myelocytic HL-60 cells, which respond to 1,25(OH)2D3 with increases in VDR expression and monocytic differentiation, neither HF nor 1,25(OH)2D3 regulated VDR expression in NB4 cells.

To characterize the key domain of TREB5 for transcriptional activation, mutational analysis was carried out. The C-terminal region of 148-221 amino acids was identified as an activation domain and was also active when fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain. This domain contains three unique regions rich in glutamic acid, glutamine, or serine/threonine and is active in both osteosarcoma (HOS) and T (Jurkat) cell lines. All of these three regions are essential; however, a part of the serine/threonine region was dispensable in Jurkat, but not in HOS cells. In addition to the activation domain, the N-terminal region showed activity in conjunction with the b-Zip structure, but not with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Furthermore, this region showed activity in Jurkat cells, but not in HOS cells.

We also compared the incidence of LEP following this treatment to that reported in the literature following treatment with high-dose MTX alone. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-eight pediatric patients of hematopoietic malignancies (37 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma) who were given CRT (18-24 Gy) as well as prophylactic intrathecal and per os MTX were studied for leukoencephalopathy by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. All the patients were free from grave neuropsychiatric disturbances. The data were examined to elucidate the influential ones of five factors (patients' age, doses of intrathecal and per os MTX, dose of CRT, interval between treatment, and MR study) to develop LEP using multiple regression analysis. To compare the effect of moderate-dose MTX and prophylactic CRT on LEP to that of high-dose MTX alone, we conducted literature review. RESULTS: Seven out of 38 patients (18%) developed LEP. From multiple regression analysis and partial correlation coefficients, the age and CRT dose seemed influential in the subsequent development of LEP. The incidence of LEP following treatment with moderate-dose MTX and prophylactic CRT appears to be less than that reported in the literature following treatment with intravenous high-dose MTX. However, even moderate-dose MTX in combination with CRT can result in a significant incidence of MR-detectable LEP, particularly in children 6 years of age or younger receiving 24 Gy. CONCLUSION: Leukoencephalopathy was caused by moderate-dose MTX and prophylactic CRT in pediatric patients, probably less frequently than by high-dose MTX treatment alone. The influential factors were patient's age and CRT dose.","['Matsumoto, K', 'Takahashi, S', 'Sato, A', 'Imaizumi, M', 'Higano, S', 'Sakamoto, K', 'Asakawa, H', 'Tada, K']","['Matsumoto K', 'Takahashi S', 'Sato A', 'Imaizumi M', 'Higano S', 'Sakamoto K', 'Asakawa H', 'Tada K']","['Department of Radiology, Tohoku University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/chemically induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(95)00565-G [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)00565-g [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jul 15;32(4):913-8. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)00565-g.,,"['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jul 15;32(4):1251-2; discussion 1263.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-four patients with a median age of 28 (range 6-48) years were entered into a Phase I/II study. All patients received cyclophosphamide (CY), 120 mg/kg administered over 2 days before TBI. Marrow from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical siblings was infused following the last dose of TBI. An escalation-deescalation schema designed to not exceed an incidence of 25% of Grade 3-4 regimen-related toxicities (RRTs) was used. The first dose level tested was 13.2 Gy followed by 14.4 Gy. RESULTS: None of the four patients at the dose level of 13.2 Gy developed Grade 3-4 RRT. Two of the first eight patients receiving 14.4 Gy developed Grade 3-4 RRT, establishing this as the MTD. An additional 32 patients were evaluated at the 14.4 Gy level to confirm these initial observations. Of 40 patients receiving 14.4 Gy, 13 (32.5%) developed Grade 3-4 RRTs; 46% in adults and 12% in children. The primary dose limiting toxicity was Grade 3-4 hepatic toxicity, which occurred in 12.5% of patients. Noninfectious Grade 3-4 interstitial pneumonia syndrome occurred in 5% of patients. The actuarial probabilities of event-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality at 2 years were 0.10, 0.81, and 0.47, respectively, for patients who received 14.4 Gy of TBI. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome for patients receiving 14.4 Gy of TBI was not different from previous studies of other CY and TBI regimens in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies. These data showed that the incidence of Grade 3-4 RRTs in adults was greater than the 25% maximum set as the goal of this study, suggesting that 13.2 Gy is a more appropriate dose of TBI for adults, while 14.4 Gy is an appropriate dose for children.","['Demirer, T', 'Petersen, F B', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Barnett, T A', 'Sanders, J', 'Deeg, H J', 'Storb, R', 'Doney, K', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Shannon-Dorcy, K']","['Demirer T', 'Petersen FB', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Barnett TA', 'Sanders J', 'Deeg HJ', 'Storb R', 'Doney K', 'Bensinger WI', 'Shannon-Dorcy K', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(95)00115-F [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)00115-f [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jul 15;32(4):1103-9. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)00115-f.,,,"['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In 1985, Wolf et al. recognized that we are dealing with a dermatologic phenomenon and established a precise definition for this phenomenon. Fifty-eight cases corresponding to the definition of this phenomenon have been reported until now. METHODS: The new phenomenon, for which the term ""isotopic response"" has been suggested, has been defined. Cases corresponding to the definition have been analyzed with special emphasis on the diseases involved, the time intervals, and the locations of the diseases. Eight new cases are described. RESULTS: A total of 58 cases of isotopic response have been described. The first disease in most of the patients was herpes zoster; in three cases it was herpes simplex, in two varicella, and in one, thrombophlebitis. The second disease, which appeared exactly at the site of the first, already healed disease, was in most reported cases a carcinoma (26 cases, in particular 15 cases of breast carcinoma, 5 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 4 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 2 basosquamous carcinomas), or granuloma annulare (16 cases). Additional diseases were Kaposi's sarcoma (2 cases), pseudolymphoma (2 cases), sarcoid (2 cases), tinea (2 cases), tuberculoid and vasculitis granuloma (1 case), angiosarcoma, metastasis, Bowen's disease, lymphoma, leukemia cutis, and acne (1 case each). The diseases did not show any predilection for a particular location. The interval between the first and second disease was extremely variable (ranging from days to years) and showed no particular features. In the eight additional cases described in the present report, the first disease was herpes simplex (6 cases) or herpes zoster (2 cases). The second disease was viral warts (3 cases) or squamous cell carcinoma (2 cases). Additional diseases were furunculosis, contact dermatitis, and molluscum contagiosum (1 case each). CONCLUSIONS: The new term, ""isotopic response,"" describes the occurrence of a new skin disorder at the site of another, unrelated, and already healed skin disease. It is suggested that the term ""isotopic response"" be included in the lexicon (glossary) of dermatology. Introducing the new term and classifying all the cases under a single key word, will make it possible to locate and collect them easily and to search for the mechanism underlying this phenomenon.","['Wolf, R', 'Brenner, S', 'Ruocco, V', 'Filioli, F G']","['Wolf R', 'Brenner S', 'Ruocco V', 'Filioli FG']","['Department of Dermatology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Ichilov Hospital, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications', 'Dermatitis, Contact/complications', 'Furunculosis/complications', 'Herpes Simplex/complications', 'Herpes Zoster/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molluscum Contagiosum/complications', 'Skin Diseases/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications', 'Warts/complications']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-4362.1995.tb03616.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 1995 May;34(5):341-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4362.1995.tb03616.x.,,"['Int J Dermatol. 2003 Aug;42(8):664-6.

The study was designed to determine the prevalence and histologic appearance of cutaneous lesions in patients with myeloid leukemia and various myeloproliferative disorders. METHODS: The histologic changes of cutaneous lesions in 52 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, polycythemia vera, and myeloid, myelomonocytic, or monocytic leukemia are presented in this study. RESULTS: Two types of cellular infiltrates were identified. In the first group, the most common pattern was a diffuse involvement by the leukemic cells through the entire dermis with preservation of a ""grenz zone"" in the superficial dermis. Two cases exhibited a Kaposi's sarcoma-like pattern, with prominent slit-like blood-filled spaces lined by myeloblasts against a fibrocellular stroma. The second group of lesions was characterized by dense, neutrophilic dermal infiltrates resembling acute neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) or pyoderma gangrenosum. In two of these cases, scattered immature blast cells admixed with the mature neutrophilic elements were identified.

To characterize the genomic sequences responsible for the CD3- LGL-restricted expression of this gene, we screened a rat genomic library with RNK-Met-1 cDNA, and obtained bacteriophage clones that contained the RNK-Met-1 gene. The RNK-Met-1 gene comprises 5 exons and spans approximately 5.2 kilobases (kb), exhibiting a similar structural organization to a class of CTL-serine proteases with protease catalytic residues encoded near the borders of exons 2, 3, and 5. The 5'-flanking region of the RNK-Met-1 gene contains a number of putative promoter and enhancer regulatory elements and shares several regions of homology with the 5'-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene. We have prepared nested deletions from approximately 3.3 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the RNK-Met-1 gene, and inserted these upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. These 5'-flanking RNK-Met-1-CAT constructs were transiently transfected into rat LGL leukemia, T-lymphoma, and basophilic leukemia cell lines. The transcriptional activity of the RNK-Met-1 5'-flanking region was strong, restricted to the RNK-16 LGL leukemia and controlled by several positive cis-acting regions spread over at least 3.3 kb. The longest and most active 5'-flanking region (-3341 to -33) was also used to drive specific expression of beta-galactosidase in RNK-16.

While all plasma ultrafiltrates from homozygotes had chromosome damaging properties, the clastogenic material had to be concentrated in most heterozygotes to reach detectable levels. The clastogenic effect was exerted via the intermediacy of superoxide radicals, since it was regularly inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD). This adds further evidence for a prooxidant state in this hereditary disease. The autosustained clastogenic activity possibly plays a role in the progressive impairment of blood cell-producing bone marrow and may predispose patients to develop cancer and leukemia.

Only five of 11 (45%) follicle centre cell lymphomas were positive by this method whilst the success rate for the remainder was 13 of 18 (72%). None of the polyclonal controls gave false positive results although occasional non-specific dominant bands were present which disappeared on repeating the experiments. These results show that this method will identify monoclonality in 62% of low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in archival material. The success rate is increased to 72% if follicle centre cell lymphomas are excluded. Thus, this method is a useful adjunctive test to aid diagnosis in lymphoid infiltrates when standard morphology and immunohistochemistry are equivocal.","['Ilyas, M', 'Jalal, H', 'Linton, C', 'Rooney, N']","['Ilyas M', 'Jalal H', 'Linton C', 'Rooney N']","['Department of Histopathology and Microbiology, Bristol Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1995.tb00194.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1995 Apr;26(4):333-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1995.tb00194.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-matched controls were used for comparison. ACTH stimulation tests were performed in the patients before and after treatment. However, in the samples taken before BMT only cortisol was measured. Basal posttreatment cortisol levels were subnormal in TBI-treated boys (n = 14, aged 5-17 years at BMT) during the adrenarcheal period (7-14 years) but became normal afterwards. All other groups had normal cortisol values. Treatment neither affected basal levels nor the ACTH-induced increment (delta-value) of cortisol. In the boys treated with TBI, normal basal levels of 17OHP and adrenal androgens were found with the exception of decreased DHA levels in the postadrenarcheal boys. However, the delta-17OHP values and had an abnormal age relation and were significantly higher than in the patients not treated with TBI. In the patients not treated with TBI (6 boys aged 2-17 years) normal responses were found for 5 years or more after treatment. In female patients treated with TBI (n = 12, aged 1-16 years) circulating levels of DHA, DHAS and A4 were significantly decreased up to 5 years or more following treatment.

The deduced amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence revealed that mouse PPO consists of 477 amino acid residues, without the leader peptide, which is imported into mitochondria. Comparison of the amino terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse PPO cDNA with that of purified bovine PPO provided conclusive evidence for lack of the leader peptide in the former. The amino acid sequence has 86% and 28% identity with human PPO and Bacillus subtilis HemY, respectively. When mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were induced with dimethylsulfoxide, PPO mRNA was induced within 12 h of treatment, and with further incubation, reached a plateau. mRNAs for coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) and ferrochelatase (FEC) were induced within 12 h, and continued to increase with time up to 48 h. The activities of CPO and FEC markedly increased with time up to 72 h, while PPO activity increased 1.8-fold within 12 h and remained unchanged thereafter. Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of PPO, CPO and FEC paralleled their corresponding activities. The magnitude of PPO induction was less than that of CPO and FEC. Thus, induction of three terminal enzymes of the heme-biosynthetic pathway is an early event in MEL cell differentiation. The concomitant induction may play an important role in producing large amounts of heme during erythroid differentiation.","['Taketani, S', 'Yoshinaga, T', 'Furukawa, T', 'Kohno, H', 'Tokunaga, R', 'Nishimura, K', 'Inokuchi, H']","['Taketani S', 'Yoshinaga T', 'Furukawa T', 'Kohno H', 'Tokunaga R', 'Nishimura K', 'Inokuchi H']","['Department of Hygiene, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.3.3.3 (Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase)', 'EC 1.3.3.4 (Ppox protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.3.3.4 (Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/enzymology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Ferrochelatase/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Flavoproteins', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0760h.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Jun 1;230(2):760-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0760h.x.,,,,['PPO'],['GENBANK/D45185'],,,,,,,,,

Among various nuclear proteins, DNA topoisomerase II appears to be a plausible candidate. This hypothesis is supported by a series of evidence, including the fact that integration is markedly affected by the topology of the target DNA and mainly occurs in transcribed regions in which topoisomerase II is preferentially located. In an attempt to confirm the validity of this hypothesis, we have comparatively investigated the early stages of a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (psi neo) in two related Chinese hamster cell lines (DC3F and R/DC3F) expressing different levels of both isoforms of topoisomerase II. R/DC3F is derived from the parental cell line DC3F and displays a resistant phenotype towards the usual anticancer topoisomerase II inhibitors (actinomycin D, doxorubicin, and taxol). Results show that the early stages of the retroviral cycle are markedly impaired in cells underexpressing topoisomerase II (R/DC3F). This alteration mimics Fv-1 restriction and is characterized by about a 6-fold decrease in viral DNA synthesis and total inhibition of viral genome integration.

As with cytosine arabinoside, conversion to the monophosphate was catalyzed by cellular deoxycytidine kinase, which was essential for cytotoxicity. However, unlike cytosine arabinoside, (-)-OddC was not susceptible to degradation by deoxycytidine deaminase. Because (-)-OddC inhibited the growth of hepatocellular and prostate tumors that are generally difficult to treat, it is a promising candidate for additional testing.

Moreover, when Friend erythroleukemia cells are treated for 96 h with the antitumor drug tiazofurin, the induction of erythroid differentiation is accompanied by changes in amounts of both phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate due to the inhibition of an uncharacterized nuclear PLC activity. Here, we show that the nuclear PLC beta 1 isoform is down-regulated by tiazofurin (5 microM) treatment of Friend erythroleukemia cells as shown by both Western blot and Northern blot analyses for PLC beta 1 message. This indicates that PLC beta 1 down-regulation is tightly linked with erythroid differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells and that the autonomous nuclear signaling via inositol lipid cycle can be controlled by the antitumor drug tiazofurin.","['Manzoli, L', 'Billi, A M', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Martelli, A M', 'Matteucci, A', 'Rubbini, S', 'Weber, G', 'Cocco, L']","['Manzoli L', 'Billi AM', 'Gilmour RS', 'Martelli AM', 'Matteucci A', 'Rubbini S', 'Weber G', 'Cocco L']","['Institute of Human Morphology, University of Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb1 protein, mouse)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/virology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*physiology', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Jul 15;55(14):2978-80.,,,,['c-Ki-ras'],,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reviewed recent research which had demonstrated that in animals, PSK has a preventive effect on chemical carcinogen-induced, radiation-induced, and spontaneously developed carcinogenesis (Kobayashi et al., Cancer Epidemiol., Biomarkers & Prev., 2: 271-276, 1993). We now focus on the effects of PSK once the progression of carcinogenesis has begun, and review what is now known of the preventive action of PSK on cancer metastasis. Recent research reports that PSK suppresses pulmonary metastasis of methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas, human prostate cancer DU145M, and lymphatic metastasis of mouse leukemia P388, and that it has prolonged the survival period in spontaneous metastasis models. PSK also suppresses the metastasis of rat hepatoma AH60C, mouse colon cancer colon 26, and mouse leukemia RL male 1 in artificial metastasis models. PSK influences the steps of cancer metastasis in a number of ways: (a) by suppression of intravasation through the inhibition of tumor invasion, adhesion and production of cell matrix-degrading enzymes; (b) by suppression of tumor cell attachment to endothelial cells through the inhibition of tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation; (c) by suppression of tumor cell migration after extravasation through the inhibition of tumor cell motility; and (d) by suppression of tumor growth after extravasation through the inhibition of angiogenesis, the modulation of cytokine production, and the augmentation of effector cell functions. In addition, PSK has suppressed the malignant progression of mouse tumor cells through superoxide trapping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kobayashi, H', 'Matsunaga, K', 'Oguchi, Y']","['Kobayashi H', 'Matsunaga K', 'Oguchi Y']","['Health Science University of Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1995 Apr-May;4(3):275-81.,,,,,,86,,,,,,,,

Seventy-two patients (27 female and 45 male patients) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 39) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n = 33) who were less than 14 years of age at BMT were studied. Before BMT all had received multiagent chemotherapy and 31 had received cranial irradiation (RT). Preparation for BMT included total body irradiation (1,375 cGy [n = 37] or 1,500 cGy [n = 35]). Heights, expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS), were studied up to 4 years post-BMT. The estimated height SDS for the entire group at the time of BMT was -0.28 +/- 0.05 and decreased to -1.11 +/- 0.22 at 4 years post-BMT (P < .0001). Using a growth curve model to compare covariate groups over the period of study, we found that the loss in height SDS was most significant in those patients who received cranial RT before BMT (P = .005). The estimated height SDS for patients treated with cranial RT went from -0.52 +/- 0.20 at transplantation to -1.83 +/- 0.23 4 years later. In contrast, patients who did not receive cranial RT before BMT showed a smaller decrease in height SDS over the 4-year observation period, ie, -0.11 +/- 0.20 decreasing to -0.73 +/- 0.21. Similarly, patients with a diagnosis of ALL had a greater loss of height SDS than those with AML (P = .033). Fifteen of 18 patients tested were found to be growth hormone (GH) deficient; 9 patients were treated with GH and all showed an improvement in growth velocity (P < .0001). We conclude that (1) children with acute leukemia who have received cranial RT and subsequently undergo BMT, primarily those with ALL, are at high risk for growth failure and GH deficiency, and (2) that fractionation of TBI may have a relative sparing effect on growth.","['Huma, Z', 'Boulad, F', 'Black, P', 'Heller, G', 'Sklar, C']","['Huma Z', 'Boulad F', 'Black P', 'Heller G', 'Sklar C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Dwarfism, Pituitary/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Growth Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Growth Hormone/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76869-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):819-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Working Party Chronic Leukemia of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,813-8,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) has been classified according to the Seattle criteria as grades 0, I, II, III, and IV for 20 years. The predictive value of such detailed grading is a matter of debate; publications usually report GVHD as present or absent or as absent, moderate, or severe. The Working Party Chronic Leukemia of the European Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation analyzed data of 1,294 patients transplanted from an allogeneic donor for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase and tested the predictive value of aGVHD grading for the following end-points: day 100 mortality (D100M), transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse incidence (RI), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and survival (SURV). aGVHD was absent in 462 patients (35.7%), grade I occurred in 335 (25.8%), grade II in 264 (20.5%), grade III in 110 (8.5%), and grade IV in 123 patients (9.5%). A total of 297 patients (23%) died within 100 days, 495 patients (38%) died of any TRM, and 100 patients (8%) died of relapse. D100M according to grades 0, I, II, III, and IV was 17%, 13%, 19%, 38%, and 70%, respectively, with significant difference between 0-II versus III-IV. TRM was 28%, 27%, 43%, 68%, and 92%, respectively, with a distinct separation between 0-I versus II-IV. RI showed a continuous decrease of 37%, 30%, 23%, 18%, and 8%, respectively, with increasing aGVHD. LFS was 45%, 51%, 44%, 26%, and 7%, respectively, and was best for patients with grade I aGVHD. This finding was also reflected in a better overall survival (60%, 64%, 53%, 30%, and 8%, respectively). The better LFS for grade I aGVHD patients compared with patients with grade 0 or II aGVHD was confirmed (P = .05) in a multivariate analysis. These data document the value of the present 5-point grading of aGVHD, ie, different outcome is observed depending on endpoint analyzed.

A subfamily of these CDKIs (p15INK4B/MTS2, p16INK4/MTS1, and p18) have a high degree of structural and functional homology and are candidate tumor-suppressor genes. We evaluated the mutational status of the p15, p16, and p18 genes in 103 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples and correlated these results with both their clinical data and additional results concerning their loss of heterozygosity in the region of the p15/p16 genes. Homozygous deletions of the p16 gene occurred extremely frequently in T-ALLs (17/22; 77%), and it was also frequent in precursor-B ALLs (12/81; 15%). Homozygous deletions of the p15 gene were also very frequent in T-ALLs (9/22; 41%), and it occurred in 5 of 81 (6%) precursor-B ALL samples. No deletions of p18 was found in any of the 103 ALL samples. Also, no point mutations of the p15, p16, and p18 genes were detected. We correlated p15/p16 alterations at diagnosis with their clinical characteristics as compared with 2,927 other patients treated similarly. Those with p15/p16 alterations were older; had higher white blood cell counts, often with T-cell ALL phenotype; and more frequently had a mediastinal mass at presentation; but they had the same nonremission, relapse, and survival rates at 5 years as did those patients whose blast cells did not have a p15/p16 deletion. To better understand the extent of alterations affecting chromosome 9p21 (location of the p15/p16 genes), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was examined at D9S171, which is about 1 megabase proximal to the p15/p16 genes. LOH was detected in 15 of 37 (41%) informative samples. Interestingly, of the 24 informative samples that had no detectable alteration of the p15/p16 genes, 7 samples (29%) had LOH at D9S171. In summary, we show in a very large study that p15 and p16, but not p18, CDKI genes are very frequently altered in ALL; those with p15/p16 alterations are more frequently older children, have higher white blood cells at presentation, and often have a T-cell ALL phenotype. The LOH analysis suggests that another tumor-suppressor gene important in ALL also is present on chromosome 9p21.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Bartram, C R', 'Seriu, T', 'Miller, C W', 'Tobler, A', 'Janssen, J W', 'Reiter, A', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Schwaller, J']","['Takeuchi S', 'Bartram CR', 'Seriu T', 'Miller CW', 'Tobler A', 'Janssen JW', 'Reiter A', 'Ludwig WD', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schwaller J', 'et al.']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76860-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):755-60.,,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Certain chimeric compounds were shown to possess targeted activity broadly equal to the parent phosphodiester or phosphorothioate forms and greater resistance to the nucleases present in cell extracts. Selected chimeric structures were compared with phosphodiester and phosphorothioate analogues for antisense activity in human CML cells containing either b2a2 or b3a2 bcr-abl breakpoint mRNAs. We present results showing that all four structures can suppress bcr-abl mRNA level in vivo.

Phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase is known to interact with and be activated by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We investigated whether PI-3 kinase associates with and/or is regulated by BCR/ABL, whether this interaction is functionally significant for Ph1 cell proliferation, and, if so, whether inhibition of PI-3 kinase activity can be exploited to eliminate Ph1-positive cells from bone marrow. We show that the p85 alpha subunit of PI-3 kinase associates with BCR/ABL and that transient expression of BCR/ABL in fibroblasts and down-regulation of BCR/ABL expression using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) in Ph1 cells activates and inhibits, respectively, PI-3 kinase enzymatic activity. The use of specific ODNs or antisense constructs to downregulate p85 alpha expression showed a requirement for p85 alpha subunit in the proliferation of BCR/ABL-dependent cell lines and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) primary cells. Similarly, wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of the p110 subunit of PI-3 kinase, inhibited growth of these cells. The growth of normal bone marrow and erythromyeloid, but not megakaryocyte, progenitors was inhibited by p85 alpha antisense [S]ODNs, but wortmannin, at the concentrations tested, did not affect normal hematopoiesis. The proliferation of two BCR/ABL- and growth factor-independent cell lines was not affected by downregulation of the expression of the p85 alpha subunit or inhibition of p110 enzymatic activity, confirming the specificity of the observed effects on Ph1 cells. Thus, PI-3 kinase is one of the downstream effectors of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase in CML cells. Moreover, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on single colonies to detect BCR-ABL transcripts showed that wortmannin was able to eliminate selectively CML-blast crisis cells from a mixture of normal bone marrow and Ph1 cells.","['Skorski, T', 'Kanakaraj, P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Ratajczak, M Z', 'Wen, S C', 'Zon, G', 'Gewirtz, A M', 'Perussia, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Kanakaraj P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Wen SC', 'Zon G', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Perussia B', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*physiology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Wortmannin']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76857-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):726-36.,,,"['CA-37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,,,,

The major drawback of this approach is the risk of false-negative results due to clonal evolution. We investigated the stability of V delta 2D delta 3 rearrangements in a group of 56 childhood B-precursor ALL patients by PCR and Southern blot analysis. At the PCR level, V delta 2D delta 3-to-J alpha rearranged subclones (one pathway for secondary TCR delta recombination) were demonstrated in 85.2% of V delta 2D delta 3-positive patients tested, which showed that small subclones are present in the large majority of patients despite apparently monoclonal TCR delta Southern blot patterns. Sequence analysis of V delta 2D delta 3J alpha rearrangements showed a biased J alpha gene usage, with HAPO5 and J alpha F in 26 of 32 and 6 of 32 clones, respectively. Comparison of V delta 2D delta 3 rearrangement status between diagnosis and first relapse showed differences in seven of eight patients studied. In contrast, from first relapse onward, no clonal changes were observed in six patients studied. To investigate the occurrence of crosslineage TCR delta rearrangements in normal B and T cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted peripheral blood CD19+/CD3- and CD19-/CD3+ cell populations from three healthy donors were analyzed. V delta 2D delta 3 rearrangements were detected at low frequencies in both B and T cells, which suggests that V delta 2-to-D delta 3 joining also occurs during normal B-cell differentiation. A model for crosslineage TCR delta rearrangements in B-precursor ALL is deduced that explains the observed clonal changes between diagnosis and relapse and is compatible with multistep leukemogenesis of B-precursor ALL.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'van den Berg, H', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'van den Berg H', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory, Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76853-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):692-702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data prompted us to perform a clinical trial with a murine anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to neutralize the excess of this putatively deleterious factor in these patients. Ten MM patients with extramedullary involvement frequently were treated with anti-IL-6 MoAb. The MoAb was administered intravenously to 9 patients; 1 patient with malignant pleural effusion received intrapleural therapy. Of the 3 patients who succumbed to progressive MM after less than 1 week of treatment (including the only 1 treated locally), 2 with evaluable data exhibited marked inhibition of plasmablastic proliferation. Among the 7 patients remaining more homogeneous receiving the anti-IL-6 MoAb for more than 1 week, 3 had objective antiproliferative effect marked by a significant reduction of the myeloma cell labelling index within the bone marrow. One of these 3 patients achieved a 30% regression of tumor mass. However, none of the patients studied achieved remission or improved outcome as judged by standard clinical criteria. Of major interest, objective antiproliferative effects were associated with complete inhibition of C-reactive protein (CRP) synthesis and low daily IL-6 production in vivo. On the other hand, the lack of effect in 4 patients was associated with a higher IL-6 production and inability of the MoAb to neutralize it. Anti-IL-6 was also associated with resolution of low-grade fever in all the patients and with worsening thrombocytopenia and mild neutropenia. The generation of human antibodies to Fc fragment of the murine anti-IL-6 MoAb observed in 1 patient was associated with dramatic progression. These data show that anti-IL-6 MoAb can suppress the proliferation of myeloma cells and underscore the biologic role of IL-6 for myeloma growth in vivo. Furthermore, suppression of CRP and worsening of neutropenia/thrombocytopenia both indicate that IL-6 is critically involved in acute-phase responses and granulopoiesis/thrombopoiesis.","['Bataille, R', 'Barlogie, B', 'Lu, Z Y', 'Rossi, J F', 'Lavabre-Bertrand, T', 'Beck, T', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Brochier, J', 'Klein, B']","['Bataille R', 'Barlogie B', 'Lu ZY', 'Rossi JF', 'Lavabre-Bertrand T', 'Beck T', 'Wijdenes J', 'Brochier J', 'Klein B']","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/etiology/therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'C-Reactive Protein/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Pleural Effusion/therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76852-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):685-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pediatric oncology group study.,666-76,"Almost 25% of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene. Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes, TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele. Hence, it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T-ALL. In this report, we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL, including many that do not display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration. A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T-ALL cells. Monoallelic expression of TAL1 was observed in the leukemic cells of all patients (8 of 8) bearing a TAL1 gene rearrangement. In the leukemic cells of patients without detectable TAL1 rearrangements, TAL1 transcription occurred in either a monoallelic (3 of 7 patients) or a biallelic (4 of 7 patients) fashion. Thus, TAL1 activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis-acting regulatory sequences (affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele) or changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL1 transcription (affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles).","['Bash, R O', 'Hall, S', 'Timmons, C F', 'Crist, W M', 'Amylon, M', 'Smith, R G', 'Baer, R']","['Bash RO', 'Hall S', 'Timmons CF', 'Crist WM', 'Amylon M', 'Smith RG', 'Baer R']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Pleural Effusion/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",1995/07/15 00:00,1995/07/15 00:01,['1995/07/15 00:00'],"['1995/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76850-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):666-76.,,,"['CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['TAL1'],,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic cells phenotypically resembled natural killer (NK) cells, and their surface IL-2 receptors were functional, as determined by the capacity to bind human recombinant IL-2 with high-affinity resulting in the transduction of proliferation signals and in the development of lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. These cells produced IL-2 spontaneously, and they may have maintained their proliferative state through an IL-2-dependent autocrine growth pathway. Our results indicate that neoplastic lymphocytes of syndromes that involve circulating leukemic cells with dermotropism can originate from NK-like cells. Additionally, the data also suggest that proliferative conditions such as these may be the result of the aberrant production of IL-2.

We examined alpha A1 (an alpha A-gene product) and alpha B1 and alpha B2 (two alpha B-encoded isomers) for their effects on the GM-CSF promoter. PEBP2 alpha A1, alpha B1, and alpha B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter.

In contrast, the promoter activity was suppressed by alpha B2. Coexpression of alpha B1 and alpha B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the alpha B1/alpha B2 ratio. Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site-binding protein(s) that cross-reacted with antimouse alpha A1 antibodies. Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2 alpha A, alpha B (AML1), and beta genes in Jurkat cells.

Expression of both a truncated and full-length MDR1 mRNA species was noted in bone marrow and spleen colony cells. The truncated message resulted from cryptic mRNA splice sites within the MDR1 cDNA and was detected with both vectors. Full-length message levels exceeded those from the endogenous genes in all but one case and roughly approximated that seen in the modestly drug-resistant cell line SW620.

A total of 124 patients entered this study. Induction consisted of standard daunorubicin and cytarabine. A day-10 bone marrow was examined; if this was aplastic without leukemia, patients received blinded placebo or GM-CSF from day 11 until neutrophil recovery. Patients who entered complete remission received the identical study medication (blinded GM-CSF or placebo) in consolidation that they had received during induction. The overall complete remission rate was 52%; 60% for the GM-CSF arm and 44% for the placebo arm (P = .08). Median times to neutrophil recovery were significantly shortened on the GM-CSF arm. The overall treatment-related toxicity from start of GM-CSF/placebo was reduced on the GM-CSF arm (P = .049). Similarly, the infectious toxicity was significantly reduced on the GM-CSF arm (P = .015). The median survival for all patients was 10.6 months in the GM-CSF group and 4.8 months in the placebo arm (P = .048).

Among them, the human erg gene has been found to be involved in Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neurectodermal tumour of childhood and acute myeloid leukaemia. Nevertheless, little is known about human erg expression. Northern blot analyses have shown a human erg expression restricted to few cell lines and thymus, but the status concerning expression during development remains unknown probably because no homologue of this gene has yet been isolated and studied in other vertebrates. We thus choose to clone the chicken erg gene (ck-erg) and to study its expression during chicken development. We obtained a bona fide clone of ck-erg and defined the transcriptional modulating properties of its product. The ck-Erg protein acts as a transcriptional activator through a conventional consensus ETS binding site. Northern blot studies on various chicken tissues, in situ analyses and comparison with the well-characterised c-ets-1 expression show that ck-erg is expressed in mesoderm- and, to a lesser extent, in ectoderm-derived tissues. During chicken development, two salient features could be observed. From stage E1 to E3.5, ck-erg expression was widely distributed in mesodermal derivatives and neural crest, resembling c-ets-1 expression. However, by E6, the expression of ck-erg exhibited, unlike c-ets-1, a drastically new and strong signal in precartilaginous condensation zones and cartilaginous skeletal primordia.

We studied the status of p53 in non-cultured samples of thymic leukemias and in cell lines established from these leukemias. In those mice with disseminated disease, primary samples were also obtained from visceral leukemic organs, and cell lines were established from these leukemic organs for further study. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), nucleic acid sequencing, and immunochemical analysis, we found that mutation of both p53 alleles occurred in leukemic cell lines developed from nine of 10 disseminated leukemias; mutation of one p53 allele with the other remaining wild-type occurred in one disseminated leukemia. A p53 mutation unique for each mouse was found in all cell lines established from the different leukemic organs of each mouse. The same mutation was also found in the non-cultured leukemic tissues of each mouse, indicating that the mutations originated in vivo and were clonal. Seven of seven non-disseminating thymomas possessed wild-type p53 only. Hence, in vivo dissemination and tissue invasiveness were associated with the loss of wild-type p53 by mutation of both alleles or by mutation and loss of heterozygosity, as revealed by studies of cell lines established from them. The selective in vivo dissemination of leukemia cells possessing p53 mutations had a parallel in vitro. Leukemia cell lines from mice harboring disseminating leukemia were established more readily (success rate greater than 80%) than lines from mice harboring thymic nondisseminating leukemia (success rate less than 10%). Additionally, while mice with disseminating leukemia harbored a mixture of wild-type and mutant p53-encoding thymoma cells, only cell lines possessing mutant p53 became established in culture. Mutations found in thymoma cell lines were always detectable by SSCP and sequencing of DNA extracted from non-cultured thymoma tissue. However, in non-cultured leukemic tissue of visceral organs, the clonal p53 mutations found in cell lines established from them were often not detectable by SSCP or sequencing but were detectable by immunochemical analysis or polymerase chain reaction amplification. This indicates an unexpected degree of masking of mutant genes by wild-type genes present in the leukemic tissue. Masking was evident even in leukemic organs that were grossly larger than normal organs. Hence, routine screening of leukemic tissue by SSCP and sequencing may result in a highly significant underestimation of the incidence of p53 mutations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hsiao, M', 'Wu, C Y', 'Low, J', 'Pattengale, P', 'Yeargin, J', 'Haas, M']","['Hsiao M', 'Wu CY', 'Low J', 'Pattengale P', 'Yeargin J', 'Haas M']","['Department of Biology and Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Heterozygote', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.2940130208 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1995 Jun;13(2):112-21. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940130208.,,,['R01CA56075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Ha-ras', 'TTG-2', 'Ttg-1', 'p53', 'rhom-2', 'v-myc']",,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) attenuates both the spontaneous proliferation of leukemic peripheral-blood progenitor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units) and their selective hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of isotretinoin in juvenile CML. METHODS: To be eligible the patients had to have newly diagnosed untreated disease, leukocytosis with monocytosis, marrow with less than 25 percent blasts, hepatosplenomegaly, no chromosomal abnormalities, and negative viral cultures and antibody titers. Isotretinoin was administered orally in single daily doses of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area. When possible, patients subsequently underwent bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Ten children (median age, 10 months) were enrolled in the study. In all 10 there was spontaneous colony formation of leukemic progenitor cells in vitro. In the eight patients tested there was hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. The only toxic effect of isotretinoin therapy was cheilitis in two patients. Four children had disease progression. Two children had complete responses to isotretinoin (normalization of the white-cell count and disappearance of organomegaly), three had partial responses (more than a 50 percent reduction in the white-cell count and degree of organomegaly), and one had a minimal response (more than a 50 percent reduction in the white-cell count, but a 26 to 50 percent reduction in the degree of organomegaly). The median duration of response was 37 months (range, 6 to 83). Three of the four children who had a complete or partial response and who did not undergo bone marrow transplantation were alive 36 to 83 months after the diagnosis of juvenile CML. The spontaneous colony formation in vitro was reduced in samples from the five patients in whom this factor was reassessed during treatment. There was also a reduction in the hypersensitivity of leukemic progenitor cells to GM-CSF in the two patients retested. CONCLUSIONS: Isotretinoin can induce durable clinical and laboratory responses in patients with juvenile CML.","['Castleberry, R P', 'Emanuel, P D', 'Zuckerman, K S', 'Cohn, S', 'Strauss, L', 'Byrd, R L', 'Homans, A', 'Chaffee, S', 'Nitschke, R', 'Gualtieri, R J']","['Castleberry RP', 'Emanuel PD', 'Zuckerman KS', 'Cohn S', 'Strauss L', 'Byrd RL', 'Homans A', 'Chaffee S', 'Nitschke R', 'Gualtieri RJ']",['University of Alabama at Birmingham.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isotretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies']",1994/12/22 00:00,1994/12/22 00:01,['1994/12/22 00:00'],"['1994/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199412223312503 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Dec 22;331(25):1680-4. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199412223312503.,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 1;332(22):1520-1; author reply 1521.

Drugs that block the ability of calmodulin to bind to and activate its target enzymes inhibit the growth of a wide variety of malignant cells. To identify more potent and selective inhibitors of this potential target for new drug development, we studied two recently synthesized compounds, KS-501 and KS-502, for their activity against calmodulin-sensitive enzymes and for their ability to block the growth of parental and multidrug-resistant leukemic cells. KS-501 and KS-502 inhibited the activation of a calmodulin-sensitive cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The mechanism of enzyme inhibition was through interfering with calmodulin activation rather than through a direct effect on the enzyme. KS-501 was more potent than KS-502 and was studied in greater detail. This compound inhibited the activation of calmodulin kinase I and II, but had less effect against cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-sensitive kinase. KS-501 was also more effective than KS-502 in inhibiting the growth of sensitive L1210 leukemic lymphocytes. Both compounds were less effective inhibitors of multidrug-resistant L1210 leukemia than of the parental line. These studies identify a new class of calmodulin inhibitor, with selectivity for calmodulin-dependent kinases over cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.

Unlike most quinolones, WIN 58161 also exhibits significant inhibitory activity against mammalian topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3). DNA gyrase and topoisomerase II inhibitory activities are enantioselective. Consequently, WIN 58161 and its enantiomer (WIN 58161-2) provide useful tools to probe the contribution of topoisomerase II inhibition to the mechanism of cytotoxicity of quinolones and the potential utility of quinolone-topoisomerase II inhibitors as antitumor agents. WIN 58161 inhibited both highly purified Escherichia coli DNA gyrase and HeLa cell topoisomerase II by the promotion of enzyme-DNA covalent complexes. WIN 58161 did not bind stably to DNA via intercalation and did not enhance the formation of topoisomerase I (EC 5.99.1.2)-DNA covalent complexes. At drug concentrations that are cytotoxic to P388 murine leukemia cells, WIN 58161 promoted intracellular DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) that exhibited the hallmarks of being mediated by topoisomerase. DNA fragments were complexed with protein, and SSBs were readily resealed at 37 degrees following drug removal. WIN 58161-2 was neither cytotoxic nor did it promote intracellular SSBs in P388. These observations suggest that the mechanism of cytotoxicity of WIN 58161 is predominantly, if not exclusively, a result of topoisomerase II inhibition. When studied in tumor-bearing mice, WIN 58161 exhibited a significant antitumor effect against each of five tumors tested, whereas neither toxicity nor antitumor activity was observed with WIN 58161-2. We conclude from these studies that WIN 58161 represents the prototype of a novel chemical class of topoisomerase II inhibitor with potential clinical utility in treating cancer.","['Coughlin, S A', 'Danz, D W', 'Robinson, R G', 'Klingbeil, K M', 'Wentland, M P', 'Corbett, T H', 'Waud, W R', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Altschuler, E', 'Bales, E']","['Coughlin SA', 'Danz DW', 'Robinson RG', 'Klingbeil KM', 'Wentland MP', 'Corbett TH', 'Waud WR', 'Zwelling LA', 'Altschuler E', 'Bales E', 'et al.']","['Department of Oncopharmacology, Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals Research Division, Sterling Winthrop Inc., Collegeville, PA 19426, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '122033-48-1 (WIN 58161)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/29 00:00,1995/06/29 00:01,['1995/06/29 00:00'],"['1995/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['000629529500016S [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)00016-s [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Jun 29;50(1):111-22. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00016-s.,,,"['CA 40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The chemoresistance level was established from the viability index (IC50) in the presence of doxorubicin. Cytocentrifuge preparations were immunostained with JSB-1 monoclonal antibody followed by the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique. The strength of the reaction was quantified by a digital image analyser. The kinetic incorporation and release of Rhodamine 123 were evaluated by flow cytometry. The parent cell lines and radiotherapy resistant subclones showed a low IC50, were JSB-1 negative and retained R123 during the whole experiment, while the chemoresistant and radio-chemoresistant cell line mutants had a high IC50, were JSB-1 positive, and actively pumped the R123 out of the cells. Good correlations were obtained between the IC50, the digital image analysis, and flow cytometry.

PCZ is dysmorphogenic to developing embryos exposed in vivo or cultured in the serum of PCZ-treated rats. However, embryos directly cultured with PCZ (up to 400 micrograms/ml) or PCZ plus S-9 liver fractions are unaffected. Since intact liver cells provide several advantages over hepatic subcellular fractions for in vitro bioactivation, we exposed rat embryos to PCZ in an embryo/hepatocyte co-culture system. Gestation day (GD) 9.5 rat embryos exposed to 0, 200, 300, or 400 micrograms PCZ/ml in the presence of untreated or phenobarbital induced male rat hepatocytes failed to display toxicity. However, in a companion study GD 9.5 rat embryos cultured in the serum from PCZ-treated rats exhibited developmental deficiencies. Studies have shown that the formation of toxic metabolites can result from glutathione (GSH) conjugation of toxicants in the liver. Therefore, in a second set of experiments, rat embryos were cultured in serum from rats pretreated with two GSH depleters (phorone and buthionine sulfoximine) and subsequently dosed with PCZ. Effects on development were enhanced when embryos were cultured in the serum from PCZ-treated/GSH depleted rats. These data indicate that PCZ requires in vivo activation to be dysmorphogenic and further suggest that the metabolite(s) responsible for procarbazine embryo-toxicity are formed readily under conditions of low GSH levels. This argues against a glutathione conjugate as the ultimate toxicant.","['Ebron-McCoy, M T', 'Nichols, H P', 'Andrews, J E', 'Kavlock, R J']","['Ebron-McCoy MT', 'Nichols HP', 'Andrews JE', 'Kavlock RJ']","['Perinatal Toxicology Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Teratog Carcinog Mutagen,"Teratogenesis, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis",8100917,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Ketones)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '8F20OEI0MV (phorone)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*etiology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites/toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/drug effects', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Ketones/toxicity', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pregnancy', 'Procarbazine/blood/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tcm.1770150105 [doi]'],ppublish,Teratog Carcinog Mutagen. 1995;15(1):33-42. doi: 10.1002/tcm.1770150105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The v-myb oncogenes of E26 leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus encode proteins that are truncated at both the amino and the carboxyl terminus, deleting portions of the c-Myb DNA-binding and negative regulatory domains. This has led to speculation that the deleted regions contain important regulatory sequences. We previously reported that the 42-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42mapk) phosphorylates chicken and murine c-Myb at multiple sites in the negative regulatory domain in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation might provide a mechanism to regulate c-Myb function. We now report that three tryptic phosphopeptides derived from in vitro phosphorylated c-Myb comigrate with three tryptic phosphopeptides derived from metabolically labeled c-Myb immunoprecipitated from murine erythroleukemia cells. At least two of these peptides are phosphorylated on serine-528. Replacement of serine-528 with alanine results in a 2- to 7-fold increase in the ability of c-Myb to transactivate a Myb-responsive promoter/reporter gene construct. These findings suggest that phosphorylation serves to regulate c-Myb activity and that loss of this phosphorylation site from the v-Myb proteins may contribute to their transforming potential.","['Aziz, N', 'Miglarese, M R', 'Hendrickson, R C', 'Shabanowitz, J', 'Sturgill, T W', 'Hunt, D F', 'Bender, T P']","['Aziz N', 'Miglarese MR', 'Hendrickson RC', 'Shabanowitz J', 'Sturgill TW', 'Hunt DF', 'Bender TP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Serine', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/03 00:00,1995/07/03 00:01,['1995/07/03 00:00'],"['1995/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.14.6429 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Jul 3;92(14):6429-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.14.6429.,,,"['AL33993/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA40042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM37537/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['c-myb', 'v-myb']",,,PMC41531,,,,,,,

In the birds studied, the transgene appeared unchanged compared to the original alv6: No major changes in alv6 DNA were detected by restriction analysis, the transgene did not express the group-specific antigen of ALV, and its presence was associated with absence of immune response to ALV. In most test years, and both TR and WGTR genomic backgrounds, alv6 was associated with delayed sexual maturity by 4 to 6 d, reduced egg production to 497 d of age by 20 to 46 eggs, and a 3.6 to 15% decline in egg production rate. No consistent effects on other traits, including mortality, were detected. When inoculated with the AC-1 isolate of Marek's disease virus in a separate experiment, TR birds with alv6 had a significantly lower body weight gain to 10 d of age than their sibs without the transgene.

We examined the physiological and molecular properties of this KIR conductance to define the nature of the underlying channel species. The macroscopic conductance revealed characteristics typical of classical K+ inward rectifiers of the IRK type. Channel gating was rapid, first order (tau approximately 1 ms at -100 mV) and steeply voltage dependent. Both activation potential and slope conductance were dependent on extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) and inward rectification persisted in the absence of internal Mg2+. The current was susceptible to a concentration- and voltage-dependent block by extracellular Na+, Cs+ and Ba2+. Initial IKIR whole-cell amplitudes as well as current rundown were dependent on the presence of 1 mM internal ATP. Perfusion of intracellular guanosine 5'-Q-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[gamma S]) suppressed IKIR with an average half-time of decline of approximately 400 s. It was demonstrated that the dominant IRK-type 25 pS conductance channel was indeed suppressed by 100 microM preloaded GTP[gamma S].

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with appropriate DNA probes is a potential alternative to routine cytogenetics. Our study examined the reliability of uptake of specific alpha satellite centromere probes from chromosome 18 (D18Z1) and X (DXZ1) and the Yq heterochromatin (pHY3.4) directly from routine hematological bone marrow smears. Altogether 34 separate hybridizations, performed on slides from 20 patients, were scored for fluorescence signals. Cells in interphase were examined with each probe using unstained slides. In addition Giemsa stained slides were destained and then used for interphase FISH. Between 412 and 631 cells were scored for the expected number of signals; 2 for the 18 centromere, 2 for the X centromere in females, one signal for the Yqh in males. The results showed the expected number of signals in 87-97% of cells with the 18 and X probes and 95-97% of cells with the Y probe.

A yeast-based heterologous expression system was therefore used to characterize human TPMT-catalyzed methylation of MP, TG, and their principal nucleotide metabolites [thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP), respectively]. MP, TG, TIMP, and TGMP were all substrates for human TPMT, exhibiting similar Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters (Km, 10.6-27.1 microM; Vmax, 31-59 nmol/min/mg of TPMT). Consistent with these kinetic parameters, human leukemia cells (CEM) incubated for 24 hr with 10 microM MP or TG accumulated significantly higher (2.3-fold, p = 0.01) concentrations of methyl-TIMP after MP incubation than methyl-TGMP after TG incubation, due to the 2.7-fold higher concentration of TIMP after MP incubation, compared with TG nucleotides (TGN) after TG incubation. Moreover, intracellular accumulation of TGN was 2.5-fold greater after TG incubation than after MP incubation (p = 0.01). These data establish that MP, TG, and their principal nucleotide metabolites are comparable substrates for polymorphic TPMT, and they demonstrate significant differences in the accumulation of active TGN and methylated nucleotides when leukemia cells are treated with MP versus TG.","['Krynetski, E Y', 'Krynetskaia, N F', 'Yanishevski, Y', 'Evans, W E']","['Krynetski EY', 'Krynetskaia NF', 'Yanishevski Y', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1995 Jun;47(6):1141-7.,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirteen patients with CML in the chronic phase of a median of 8 months (range: 1-43) in length and 13 healthy individuals were studied. The NK cells were separated from the peripheral blood by centrifugation by density gradient, elutriation and depletion in flasks with the CD5 and CD8 monoclonal antibodies. The resulting cell solution was cultivated in medium with IL-2 (1,000 U/ml) for 16 days with the count, phenotypic study and cytotoxicity tests of non adherent cells (LAK) being thereafter performed. RESULTS: Following the separation, the CD56+/CD3- cells constituted 6.9 +/- 2.4% of the total of the patients with CML. At day 16 of the culture, the non adherent cells of the CD56+/CD3- phenotype (LAK cells) were found to be 57.9 +/- 4.4% of the total (expansion = 31 +/- 10.4 fold with respect to the initial number of NK cells). The LAK cells showed intense cytotoxic activity versus the killer-sensitive K562 cell lines (76.2 +/- 4.2% of lysis to the effector/target cell proportion 20:1 and 5.6 +/- 1.3% to the proportion 0.08:1) and Raji killer-resistant (65.7 +/- 4.3% and 3.8 +/- 1.6%, respectively). Thus, the grade of LAK cell expansion and their cytotoxicity in patients with CML were significantly lower than in healthy individuals.

Also, CPT induces differentiation of human leukemia cells in vitro along specific lineages. In this study, we have investigated the effects of 9NC on nontumorigenic HepG2 cells derived from human hepatoblastoma. A newly discovered senescent cell-derived inhibitor (SDI1) plays a critical role in the cell cycle, so we evaluated the effect of 9NC on the expression of the SDI1 gene. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of 9NC on HepG2 cells were evaluated by monitoring DNA synthesis, morphologic and ultrastructural changes of cells, and perturbation in the cell cycle and by assessing the levels of p53 protein and SDI1 mRNA. RESULTS: Treatment of HepG2 cells with 9NC results in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content showed that 9NC-treated HepG2 cells are arrested in the G2-phase of the cell cycle. Light and electron microscopic examination revealed that 9NC at low concentrations induces morphologic and growth features that resemble properties highly differentiated or senescent cells, i.e., increased cell size and decreased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, as well as enlarged numbers of lysosomes, mitochondria, and lipid in the cytoplasm. No significant alteration in the p53 protein level was noted in 9NC-treated cells. In contrast to untreated, logarithmically grown HepG2 cells, 9NC-treated cells arrested at the G2-phase of the cell cycle and contained increased levels of SDI1 mRNA. Kinetic studies revealed gradual increases in SDI1 mRNA synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of SDI1 mRNA by 9NC represents the first documentation that the SDI1 gene can be overexpressed in the G2-phase of the cell cycle and provides a valuable cell culture system to dissect the events controlling the G2 checkpoint. In addition, this finding corroborates the hypothesis that genes up-regulated in senescent cells can also be induced in tumor-derived immortalized cells.","['Khaoustov, V I', 'Ozer, A', 'Smith, J R', 'Noda, A', 'Mearns, M', 'Krishnan, B', 'Slagle, B L', 'Yoffe, B']","['Khaoustov VI', 'Ozer A', 'Smith JR', 'Noda A', 'Mearns M', 'Krishnan B', 'Slagle BL', 'Yoffe B']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'H19C446XXB (rubitecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', '*G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1995 Jul;73(1):118-27.,,,"['AG11066/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AG07123/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis of human leukemias, which are typically clonal, commonly shows multiple genetic lesions in a single leukemia including chromosomal translocations, gene amplification, and point mutations, and in several cases the mutational activation of an oncogene and the loss of a tumor suppressor gene have been found in the same leukemic cell. Accumulative evidences suggest that a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are involved in the hematopoietic tumorigenesis. These mutations can be utilized for molecular diagnosis of human hematopoietic tumors. Among them, detection of chimeric gene generated by chromosomal translocation is especially useful for molecular diagnosis. The t(3;21) (q26;q22) translocation is found usually in blastic crisis of CML and leukemias developed from MDS or hematopoietic proliferative diseases, but never in de novo acute myelocytic leukemia. This raises the possibility that the molecular event underlying the t(3;21) translocation has a critical role in progression from a preleukemic state to a leukemic state. The generation of AML1/EVI-1 chimeric gene has been demonstrated to be consistent in t(3;21)-carrying leukemias. Although target genes remain to be elucidated for both AML1 and EVI-1 as transcription factors, the AML1/EVI-1 fusion protein could work on different set of genes critical to the process of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.","['Hirai, H']",['Hirai H'],"['3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

METHODS: A review of all reports published since 1965 related to all forms of extramedullary leukemia (LC, GS, gingival hypertrophy, and meningeal leukemia [ML]). RESULTS: Several factors, including chromosomal abnormalities [t(8;21), inv(16)], cell-surface markers (CD56, CD2, CD4, CD7), French-American-British (FAB) subtype (M2, M4, M5), blast differentiation and maturation, patient nutritional status, age, cellular immune dysfunction, high presenting leukocyte count, and decreased blast Auer rods, have been associated with a higher incidence of EML. Of 154 published cases of primary EML identified, 71 (46%) were initially misdiagnosed. The addition of immunohistochemical stains can assist in preventing such misdiagnoses and should be included in all atypical lymphoma/carcinoma cases. Only one of the patients (3%) with primary EML did not progress to ANLL in the absence of chemotherapy. In contrast, 66% of patients who received chemotherapy for the primary EML never developed ANLL. The prognostic significance of EML at presentation and medullary relapse of ANLL is uncertain. Isolated extramedullary recurrence of ANLL always heralds bone marrow relapse and should be treated with reinduction chemotherapy. Close clinical follow-up observation is necessary to insure resolution of EML. Radiation therapy is an effective local treatment for resistant or symptomatic EML. CONCLUSION: Many advances in diagnoses and treatment of EML have been made. Future investigations are needed to define the clinical significance of EML in patients with ANLL treated with modern chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.","['Byrd, J C', 'Edenfield, W J', 'Shields, D J', 'Dawson, N A']","['Byrd JC', 'Edenfield WJ', 'Shields DJ', 'Dawson NA']","['Department of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Biomarkers', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Radiography', 'Risk Factors']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1800 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1800-16. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1800.,,,,,,246,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the mechanism of action, clinical pharmacology, and clinical studies of HDM with and without autologous bone marrow support (ABMT) or peripheral-blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in the following disease areas: myeloma, ovarian cancer, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and acute leukemia. RESULTS: HDM has a distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) of 5 to 15 minutes and an elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of 17 to 75 minutes at doses of 140 to 180 mg/m2, with significant intrapatient variability. At these doses, a wide range of areas under the concentration/time curve (AUC) have been reported, ie, 146 to 1,515 mg/min/mL. HDM has significant clinical activity in patients with multiple myeloma in relapse or when used as consolidative therapy in relapsed ovarian cancer, relapsed Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and relapsed neuroblastoma. Additional studies are required to determine the activity of HDM in Ewing's sarcoma or acute leukemia. Toxicities of HDM include myelosuppression, moderate nausea and vomiting, moderate to severe mucositis and diarrhea, and, infrequently, hepatic venoocclusive disease. CONCLUSION: HDM has become an established and effective salvage regimen for children with relapsed neuroblastoma, as well as an effective consolidative treatment for children with high-risk disease (stage IV). HDM is emerging as an active and effective mode of treatment in patients with stage II and III myeloma.

To evaluate the biologic significance of persistent bcr-abl-positive cells, we examined the relationship between clinical parameters known to affect the risk of relapse and the ability to detect bcr-abl-positive cells post-BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 480 samples from 92 patients at two transplant centers for the presence of bcr-abl-positive cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two different BMT preparative regimens and protocols for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were used. One center used cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation (CY/TBI) and T-cell-depleted marrow; the second center used busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (Bu/CY) and untreated marrow with cyclosporine and methotrexate (Csp/MTX) as GVHD prophylaxis. RESULTS: We first determined the percent of patients at each center with > or = one PCR-positive (PCR+) result at defined intervals post-BMT. Between 0 and 6 months post-BMT, the majority of patients (80% to 83%) in both populations had PCR-detectable bcr-abl-positive cells. Between 6 and 24 months post-BMT, 80% to 88% of patients who received T-cell-depleted marrow remained PCR+, as compared with 26% to 30% of patients who received unmodified marrow. After 24 months post-BMT, the percentage of PCR+ patients was not significantly different in the two populations. This pattern of detection of bcr-abl-positive cells post-BMT followed the development of chronic GVHD in patients who received unmodified marrow. All patients were also divided into three groups based on post-BMT PCR results as follows: (1) persistent PCR+ (n = 29), (2) intermittent PCR-negative ([PCR-] n = 40), and (3) persistent PCR- (n = 23). These three groups were found to have a low, intermediate, and high probability of maintaining remission and disease-free survival, respectively (P = .0001). Intermittent or persistent PCR- results, which reflect levels of minimal residual disease < or = the limit of detection by PCR, were clearly associated with both acute (P = .004) and chronic (P = .000005) GVHD. Nevertheless, 44% of patients without GVHD also had intermittent or persistent PCR- assays. CONCLUSION: The persistence of PCR-detectable bcr-abl-positive cells early post-BMT in more than 80% of patients suggests that neither BMT preparative regimen effectively eradicates CML cells in most patients. Subsequently, acute and/or chronic GVHD are associated with a decreased ability to detect residual bcr-abl-positive cells, which suggests that immunologic mechanisms mediated by donor cells are important for inducing long-term remissions after BMT. The demonstration that 44% of patients without GVHD had either low or undetectable levels of residual leukemia suggests the presence of mechanisms capable of suppression or eradication of CML independent of GVHD.","['Pichert, G', 'Roy, D C', 'Gonin, R', 'Alyea, E P', 'Belanger, R', 'Gyger, M', 'Perreault, C', 'Bonny, Y', 'Lerra, I', 'Murray, C']","['Pichert G', 'Roy DC', 'Gonin R', 'Alyea EP', 'Belanger R', 'Gyger M', 'Perreault C', 'Bonny Y', 'Lerra I', 'Murray C', 'et al.']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1704 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1704-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1704.,,,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This record review was prompted by a patient with ALL who died suddenly of varicella hepatitis within 24 hours of presentation with a single skin lesion. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children diagnosed with ALL at the CHP from January 1984 through December 1993, who subsequently developed VZV infection. RESULTS: Of 294 patients aged 0 to 15 years, 41 (14%) were identified as having had 42 episodes of VZV infection. Twenty patients (49%) had received prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG), and all 39 patients in whom the diagnosis was made premortem were treated with acyclovir. Twenty-nine of the 42 cases (70%) had disease limited to the skin. Thirteen cases (30%) had extracutaneous involvement, and five of these episodes (12% of all cases) ended in death. Risk factors for progressive varicella included age greater than 6 years and intensive immunosuppressive therapy at the time of exposure. Six of eight patients with progressive varicella, including two who died, had received VZIG. The clinical presentation in 10 of 13 patients with progressive disease and in four of five patients who died was dominated by severe abdominal and/or back pain. In seven cases, these symptoms preceded the development of skin lesions by several days, and in six patients were associated with extensive involvement of the spleen by varicella, as demonstrated histopathologically by the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on peripheral-blood smear or radiographically. No patient with uncomplicated varicella was reported to have had premonitory pain. CONCLUSION: Recognition of these prodromes and suspicion of varicella even in the absence of skin lesions and even in children with a history of prior disease or VZIG administration should prompt early diagnostic and therapeutic measures.","['Rowland, P', 'Wald, E R', 'Mirro, J R Jr', 'Yunis, E', 'Albo, V C', 'Wollman, M R', 'Blatt, J']","['Rowland P', 'Wald ER', 'Mirro JR Jr', 'Yunis E', 'Albo VC', 'Wollman MR', 'Blatt J']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15213, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Abdominal Pain/complications', 'Adolescent', 'Back Pain/complications', 'Chickenpox/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Herpesvirus 3, Human', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Pneumonia, Viral/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/*complications/mortality/therapy']",1995/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1697 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1697-703. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1697.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we identified all cases of AML or MDS developing in patients treated on six clinical adjuvant chemotherapy trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients population included 2,638 patients with previously untreated primary operable breast cancer entered onto six clinical trials conducted by the ECOG between 1978 and 1987. There are 19,200 persons-years of follow-up study and a mean follow-up duration of 7.3 years. Clinical data were obtained from flow sheets submitted to the ECOG Data Management Office. RESULTS: Of 2,638 patients at risk with 19,200 person-years of follow-up study, three patients developed MDS (two with a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality). Two patients developed acute leukemia; however, one had adult T-cell leukemia associated with human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and a second patient developed AML after receiving additional cyclophosphamide for metastatic breast cancer. The estimated incidence rate for MDS is three per 19,200 or 16 per 100,000 person-years of follow-up study with a 95 percent confidence interval of three to 46 per 100,000 person-years. If all five patients (three MDS and two acute leukemia) are included, the estimated incidence rate is five per 19,200 or 26 per 100,000 person-years of follow-up study with a 95 percent confidence interval of eight to 61 per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the risk of secondary AML or MDS among patients with early breast cancer who receive standard-dose cyclophosphamide-containing adjuvant chemotherapy is not much higher than in the general population. However, physicians must remain alert to the possible long-term consequences of alkylating agent and anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","['Tallman, M S', 'Gray, R', 'Bennett, J M', 'Variakojis, D', 'Robert, N', 'Wood, W C', 'Rowe, J M', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Tallman MS', 'Gray R', 'Bennett JM', 'Variakojis D', 'Robert N', 'Wood WC', 'Rowe JM', 'Wiernik PH']","['Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1557 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1557-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.7.1557.,,"['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1534-6.

Despite prophylaxis of infectious diseases by oral administration of 2,400 mg/day amphotericin B (AMPH), 600 mg/day ofloxacin, and 1,500 mg/day kanamycin, pneumonia with refractory pyrexia appeared and developed cystic lesions with air crescent signs thereafter. Finally, the cystic one formed fungus balls. The pneumonia was diagnosed as aspergillus pneumonia by fungus growth in the tissue in the transbronchial lung biopsy specimens and by an elevation of serum anti-Aspergillus antibody. The patient had continuously been administered with AMPH for 16 days, increasing the drug doses every 2 days. The maximum plasma level of AMPH rose up to 0.78 micrograms/ml, the total amount up to 166 mg. The fungus balls disappeared completely without adverse effects except a transient decrease of plasma potassium level. Pharmacological studies had been reported that tissue AMPH levels elevated more than twice as much as that of the plasma. Although the maximum plasma level was less than that of MIC for Aspergillus, the lung tissue drug level was suspected to have been maintained higher by continuous drip infusion. These findings indicate that continuous drip infusion of AMPH is one of the useful treatment for lung aspergillosis.","['Inai, K', 'Ueda, T', 'Kagawa, D', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Nakamura, T']","['Inai K', 'Ueda T', 'Kagawa D', 'Iwasaki H', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

In this report, we describe that engagement of CD82 can delivery such a costimulatory signal for full activation of the human T cell line Jurkat, leading to strong IL-2 production and cell differentiation. The CD82 Ag, which belongs to the new tetra-span-transmembrane family (CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, and CD81 (TAPA-1)), has been identified originally in our laboratory for its enhanced expression on three LAK-susceptible cell lines, and has been characterized as an activation/differentiation marker of mononuclear cells. Jurkat cells, stimulated in vitro by co-immobilization of anti-CD82 and anti-CD3 mAbs, produced high levels of IL-2, became strongly adherent to plastic dishes, and developed dendritic processes. These morphologic changes, associated with a total arrest of cell proliferation, were not the result of cell death but rather of cell differentiation, as shown by an increase in their metabolic activity. Costimulation through both CD82 and CD3 induced up-regulation of both IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA synthesis (but not of IL-4) and an increased expression of HLA class I molecules at the cell surface, which was inhibited by anti-IFN-gamma Ab.","['Lebel-Binay, S', 'Lagaudriere, C', 'Fradelizi, D', 'Conjeaud, H']","['Lebel-Binay S', 'Lagaudriere C', 'Fradelizi D', 'Conjeaud H']","['Immunomodulation and Autoimmunity Laboratory, Rene Descartes University, Cochin Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Kangai-1 Protein', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Phenotype', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Jul 1;155(1):101-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, at higher cell concentrations, the inhibitory effects by B3A2 AS PS-ODN were reduced and B2A2 AS PS-ODNs could suppress the proliferation of BV173 cells with much more relative sequence specificity. The 26mer B2A2 AS PS-ODN induced apoptosis of BV173 cells following reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA expression and p210 protein synthesis. Various sense (S), reverse order, and random sequences had no inhibitory effects except 16mer B2A2 S and B3A2 S that revealed significant suppressive effects. Furthermore, 26mer B3A2 AS also reduced B2A2 mRNA expression and p210 protein synthesis, while 16mer S sequences did not.

Physical mapping studies by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the PML gene is flanked by two CpG islands that are separated by a variable distance in normal individuals. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that this is the consequence of a large insertion/deletion polymorphism linked to the PML locus: (1) overlapping fragments obtained with a variety of rare-cutting restriction enzymes demonstrated the same variability in distance between the flanking CpG islands; (2) mapping with restriction enzymes insensitive to CpG methylation confirmed that the findings were not a consequence of variable methylation of CpG dinucleotides; (3) the polymorphism followed a Mendelian inheritance pattern. This polymorphism is localized 3' to the PML locus. There are five common alleles, described on the basis of BssHII fragments, ranging from 220 to 350 kb with increments of approximately 30 kb between alleles. Both heterozygous (61%) and homozygous (39%) patterns were observed in normal individuals.

To evaluate whether this cholangiographic appearance is present in non-PSC livers as well as the histological features seen in non-PSC livers with this cholangiographic appearance, we performed postmortem intrahepatic cholangiography in 154 liver autopsy specimens. The PSC-like cholangiographic appearance was frequently found in cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (4 of 6, 67%), hepatocellular carcinoma (1 of 1, 100%), adult-type polycystic disease of the liver and kidneys (2 of 3, 67%), submassive hepatic necrosis (2 of 5, 40%), amyloidosis (1 of 2, 50%), and intrahepatic extensive thrombosis (1 of 1, 100%). It was also found but at lower frequency in metastatic carcinomas (3 of 13, 23%) and leukemia/lymphoma infiltration (2 of 12, 17%). Histologically, in livers with such a PSC-like cholangiographic appearance, the intrahepatic bile ducts were compressed by fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, liver cysts, cancer cell infiltration, amyloid deposition, or portal thrombi. Dilated ducts had less pronounced changes than strictured ducts. In these hepatobiliary diseases, the changes of intrahepatic bile ducts in the livers without the PSC-like cholangiographic appearance were much less marked than those in the livers with it. These data suggest that the PSC-like intrahepatic cholangiographic appearance is present in several hepatobiliary diseases and that clinicians should take such diseases into consideration if stricture with or without dilation is found on intrahepatic cholangiography.","['Terada, T', 'Nakanuma, Y']","['Terada T', 'Nakanuma Y']","['Second Department of Pathology, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Biliary Tract Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cadaver', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cholangiography', 'Cholangitis, Sclerosing/*diagnostic imaging', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S027091399500259X [pii]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 1995 Jul;22(1):75-81.,,['Hepatology. 1997 Mar;25(3):780-1.

The second is a suspension assay in which clonogenic cells increase exponentially and which reflects self-renewal. Jaspamide, at micromolar concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner, suppressed both primary colony formation in agar and the recovery of clonogenic cells from suspension culture in the investigated cell lines and in fresh blasts. Furthermore, Jaspamide was more effective in inhibiting clonogenic cells grown in suspension than primary colonies grown in agar. In addition, Jaspamide, similarly to ARA-C, was able to induce immunophenotypic maturation of leukemic cell lines (upregulation of CD14 and CD11 and downregulation of CD34 antigens).

Resistance to chemotherapy remains an obstacle to the successful treatment of human cancer and has been the subject of numerous investigations aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms of resistance in cancer cells. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which tumor cells develop resistance to chemotherapy may not only enhance the activity of cytotoxic therapy in advanced malignancies but may ultimately improve the impact of adjuvant therapy, potentially resulting in prolonging disease-free intervals and survival. In this review, therefore, we discuss our current understanding of the MDR1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, which is responsible for one mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR). We also review the evidence supporting the clinical relevance of the MDR1 gene and clinical trials aimed at reversing MDR-mediated resistance. Although MDR-mediated drug resistance has been well characterized in preclinical models, its role in clinical drug resistance is not as well characterized and requires further investigation. Prospective studies are necessary to establish the role of MDR1 gene expression in the clinical resistance. The ability to identify tumors with increased MDR1 gene expression has several potential applications (for example, the prediction of response to chemotherapy and the design of studies aimed at reversal of resistance with agents that inhibit MDR-mediated drug efflux). The initial goal of such trials is to demonstrate the ability to reverse MDR1-mediated drug resistance in the appropriate advanced refractory malignancies. Ultimately, it will be important to incorporate these reversal strategies in the treatment of early-stage disease, at which time the tumor burden is smaller and fewer mechanisms of resistance may be present. Prospective phase I, II, and III clinical trials using reversing agents in conjunction with chemotherapy in malignancies that express the MDR1 gene, such as the hematologic malignancies and breast cancer, are necessary before routine use of agents such as verapamil, quinidine, and cyclosporine, which carry innate toxicities. MDR is a mechanism of drug resistance that provides the potential for an alteration in drug efflux, which may have a significant impact on response and possibly result in improved survival for some cancer patients.","['Goldstein, L J']",['Goldstein LJ'],"['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Research Design', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Verapamil/therapeutic use']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0147-0272(07)80004-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1995 Mar-Apr;19(2):65-124.,,,,,,184,,,,,,,,

These findings raise interesting questions about the possible roles of either the abnormal BCR gene or other genetic events such as the complex chromosomal abnormalities that result in hLH-2 being turned off in JK-1 cells.","['Wu, H K']",['Wu HK'],"['Ontario Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/08 00:00,1995/06/08 00:01,['1995/06/08 00:00'],"['1995/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['030438359503781Q [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(95)03781-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1995 Jun 8;92(2):215-22. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(95)03781-q.,,,,"['BCR', 'Hox', 'hLH-2']",,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, activation of THP-1 cells with insoluble immune complexes of LDL or LDL stimulated generation of reactive oxygen intermediates that, in turn, could oxidize exogenous LDL.

By using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) method, we attempted to define the haemopoietic defect underlying this slow engraftment, and assessed the usefulness of LTBMC in predicting engraftment. Cryopreserved bone marrow (BM) harvested from three different groups (AML autografts, n = 18; autografts for non-leukaemic diseases, n = 23; normal donors. n = 10) were cultured and their growth was compared and correlated with the speed of engraftment. In the AML autografts, non-adherent and adherent progenitor production was significantly reduced compared with normal BM during the whole culture period (P < 0.01). None of the LTBMC parameters was found to correlate with engraftment after autologous BMT. The non-leukaemic autografts showed progenitor production intermediate between normal and AML autografts. Their progenitor content at the end of the culture period (reflecting the stem cell pool) was not statistically different from normal BM. In this group, most of the progenitor cell contents, during LTBMC correlated with neutrophil (rs = -0.618 to -0.879, P < 0.01) and platelet (rs = -0.479 to -0.707, P < 0.02) recovery. The conclusion drawn from these results is that AML autografts are defective in their ability to sustain in vitro haemopoiesis, but this in vivo defect does not correlate with the slow haemopoietic recovery after autologous BMT. In contrast, LTBMC of autografts for non-leukaemic diseases, whose defect affects the stem cell pool to a lesser extent than BM in AML correlates with the speed of engraftment.","['Straetmans, N', 'Ma, D D', 'Herman, P', 'Zenebergh, A', 'Chang, A', 'Deneys, V', 'De Bruyere, M', 'Ferrant, A']","['Straetmans N', 'Ma DD', 'Herman P', 'Zenebergh A', 'Chang A', 'Deneys V', 'De Bruyere M', 'Ferrant A']","['Department of Haematology, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/therapy', 'Macrophages', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Mar;15(3):421-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decreased potential for GVHD may be advantageous for allogeneic transplant, but this benefit might be counteracted by loss of the GVHD associated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The GVL potential of cord blood could be doubly compromised since cord blood NK cell activity is also decreased. To assess these issues we have performed extensive comparative functional and immunophenotypic evaluations of cord and adult mononuclear cells. We found a somewhat reduced alloproliferative, allostimulatory and allocytolytic capacity of cord blood mononuclear cells in bulk assays but not by limiting dilution assays. Immunophenotyping revealed no significant differences in the proportion of major lymphocyte subsets with the exception of the previously recognized predominance of CD45RA+ cells in both CD4 and CD8 cord blood T cells. Cord blood T cells expressed normal percentages of the cellular adhesion molecules, CD11a, CD18 and LFA-3; however, the antigen density of each of these molecules was less than that found on adult T cells. Fewer resting cord blood T cells expressed CD54, the ligand for LFA-1. Cord blood B cells and monocytes expressed normal levels of HLA-class I and HLA class II DR, DP and DQ antigens, suggesting that the decreased expression of cellular adhesion molecules or their receptors rather than a decrease in expression of HLA might have contributed to the lower alloreactivity of cord blood. Although the percentages of NK cells and NK cell subsets in adult and cord blood were similar our data confirmed that cord blood has very low NK lytic activity. In contrast, LAK activity was much more readily induced in cord blood compared with adult PBMC, a finding which could be explained in part by a higher frequency of LAK precursors and a more rapid expansion of NK cells in response to culture with medium containing of NK cells in response to culture with medium containing IL-2. Cord blood LAK cells were readily able to lyse fresh leukemia targets from patients with ALL, AML and CML. The data indicate that although the alloreactive potential of cord blood cells may be somewhat decreased, it is not absent and must be considered a factor in cord blood transplants. LAKp with the potential to lyse leukemia are present in increased numbers in cord blood and might contribute to the GVL effect of a cord blood transplant.","['Keever, C A', 'Abu-Hajir, M', 'Graf, W', 'McFadden, P', 'Prichard, P', ""O'Brien, J"", 'Flomenberg, N']","['Keever CA', 'Abu-Hajir M', 'Graf W', 'McFadden P', 'Prichard P', ""O'Brien J"", 'Flomenberg N']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee County Medical Complex 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Mar;15(3):407-19.,,,['RC-25 CA59796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Early timing of IL-2 administration and high dose were shown to be critical to achieve this protective effect. Although a 2.5 day course of IL-2, begun on the day of BMT, was found to confer marked protection without observable toxicity, shorter courses and a higher dose of IL-2 than 5 x 10(4) Cetus units per treatment have not been previously evaluated in this model. We now demonstrate that administration of a three-treatment course of IL-2 over a 25 h period beginning 15 h following BMT is sufficient to provide maximal GVHD protection, that increasing the IL-2 dose beyond 5 x 10(4) units per treatment does not further improve the level of GVHD protection, and that further division of IL-2 treatments to achieve more constant tissue levels does not result in improved GVHD protection. We also demonstrate that IL-2 is still protective when administered in combination with cyclosporine.

Fourteen patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 32 autologous BMT. Most patients were boys (36 of 46). Twenty one cases were of lymphoblastic lymphoma, 19 Burkitt's lymphoma and six diffuse large cell lymphoma. Maximal Murphy's stage any time before BMT was stage III in 17 cases and stage IV in 29 cases. At BMT, 13 cases were in first CR, 21 in second CR, seven in third CR, four with sensitive active disease and one with refractory disease. All patients transplanted in CRl were considered candidates for BMT because of delayed CR (two cases), failure of the first-line therapy (seven cases) or central nervous system (CNS) or BM infiltration at diagnosis (four cases). Conditioning therapy included TBI in 33 patients and 13 cases were conditioned with chemotherapy alone. Toxic mortality was 13% (three of 14 in the allogeneic BMT group and three of 32 in the autologous group). No toxic deaths were registered in 13 patients undergoing BMT in CR1 (three allogeneic BMT and ten autologous BMT). Twelve patients relapsed 1-7 months after BMT.

This effect was accompanied by a significant increase of the activity of two key enzymes of the polyamine pathway, i.e. ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC). The induction of ODC activity was associated with increased expression of the ODC gene. The participation of ODC in early events evoked by OA in leukemic cells was confirmed by the decrease of the stimulatory effect of OA on cell proliferation in the presence of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)--an irreversible inhibitor of ODC. The involvement of protein kinase C (PK-C) and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases in OA action on K 562 leukemic cells was demonstrated by a significant reduction of cell proliferation by addition of H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine). Since PK-C is involved both in induction of ODC activity and in membrane transport of polyamines, H-7 significantly inhibited the proliferation of K 562 leukemic cells even in the presence of OA and exogenous putrescine. The importance of extracellular sources of polyamines for leukemic cell growth was shown by supplementation of the incubation medium with putrescine. Exogenous putrescine significantly enhanced the concentration of spermidine and spermine within the cell and increased the number of cells. The effect of OA on natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity was also examined. Rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effector cells and K 562 cells as targets. OA, progressively with dose, significantly decreased specific lysis when targets were preincubated with it. On the other hand, pretreatment of PBMC effector cells with OA, regardless of the applied concentration, did not affect the amount of 51Cr released from lysed cells. OA as a promoter of carcinogenesis stimulates proliferation of leukemic cells and impairs their responsiveness to NK activity. ODC/polyamine system and PK-C appear to be involved in OA action on K 562 cells. The presented observations are important from a practical point of view, since an elevated blood concentration of OA resulting from the impaired kidney function in hematological proliferative diseases may accelerate their progression.","['Grzelkowska, K', 'Motyl, T', 'Ostrowski, J', 'Trzeciak, L']","['Grzelkowska K', 'Motyl T', 'Ostrowski J', 'Trzeciak L']","['Department of Animal Physiology, Veterinary Faculty, Warsaw Agricultural University, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '61H4T033E5 (Orotic Acid)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biogenic Polyamines/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Orotic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925571095003605 [pii]', '10.1016/0925-5710(95)00360-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1995 Apr;61(3):147-56. doi: 10.1016/0925-5710(95)00360-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We carried out allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA) to detect a mutation at the first nucleotide A of codon 1423 (AAG), a mutational hot spot. We also employed a polymerase chain reaction mediated single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method to confirm the result of ASRA and to detect a point mutation in other sequences of FLR exon. In consequence, ASRA disclosed wild type configuration and PCR-SSCP showed no aberrant band in any sample examined whether the samples harboured an Nras mutation or not.

This report describes a procedure for coupling proteins to liposomes that results in little or no change in liposome size. This is achieved by incorporating appropriate levels of poly(ethylene glycol)-modified lipids into the liposomes. The studies employed thiolated avidin-D coupled to liposomes containing the thio-reactive lipid N-(4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyryl)dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (1 mol % of total lipid) and various amounts of MePEG-S-POPE (monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) linked to phosphatidylethanolamine via a succinate linkage). The influence of PEG chain length and density was also assessed. The presence of PEG on the surface of liposomes is shown to provide an effective method of inhibiting aggregation and the corresponding increase in liposome size during the covalent coupling of avidin-D. A balance between the size of the PEG used and the amount of PEG-lipid incorporated into the liposome had to be achieved in order to maintain efficient coupling. Optimal coupling efficiencies in combination with minimal aggregation effects were achieved using 2 mol % MePEG2000-S-POPE (PEG of 2000 MW) or 0.8 mol % MePEG5000-S-POPE (PEG of 5000 MW). At these levels, the presence of PEG did not affect the biotin binding activity of the covalently attached avidin.

In addition, various substances and cellular transcription factors are also known to activate the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-mediated transcription in the absence of Tax. In this work we demonstrate that infection of either Jurkat or 293 cell lines with herpes simplex I (HSV-1), a widespread infectious virus of humans, activates HTLV-1 LTR-mediated gene expression. Further investigation revealed that each of the immediate-early (IE) gene products--ICPO, ICP4, and ICP27--of HSV-1 transactivates the HTLV-1 LTR-mediated gene expression in the absence of Tax. The HSV-1 activation is additive to Tax activation in its presence in the cell. Three 21 base repeats upstream of the TATA box are known as the TAX responsive elements (TRE). Recombinant HTLV-1 minimal promoter composed of the HTLV-1 TATA box fused to a synthetic 21 base TRE is responsive to Tax but not to HSV-1 activation. It thus can be concluded that HSV-1 IE gene products and Tax transactivates HTLV-1 LTR mediated gene expression through different transcription complexes.

A marked increase in expression of beta 7 was also observed. There was a significant increase in the adhesion of NK cells to fibronectin in response to IL-2 treatment. NK cells also bound more strongly to BMF following IL-2 treatment although the development of cytotoxicity appeared to interfere with the adhesion assay. NK cells competitively inhibit the binding of AML blasts but not ALL blasts to BMF.

For this purpose we have prospectively investigated the immunophenotype of blast cells from 40 de novo AML patients at diagnosis with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies in double and triple staining combinations analyzed at flow cytometry. The discrimination between the different cell populations was based on: (1) the existence of aberrant phenotypes; (2) differences in light-scatter characteristics; and (3) the expression of differentiation-associated antigens (CD34, CD117, HLADR, CD33, CD15, CD14, CD11b and CD4).

The most common criteria for discrimination of blast cell subpopulations was based on the expression of maturation-associated antigens and, interestingly, the blast subpopulations defined by higher reactivity for myeloid differentiation-associated markers had a more mature FSC/SSC pattern. In 53% of the patients at least one of the subpopulations identified was minimal (< 10% of the total leukemic cells). Regarding the existence of aberrant phenotypes three situations were observed: (1) none of the subpopulations had antigenic aberrations (10 cases); (2) coexistence of normal and aberrant subpopulations (five cases); and (3) all the subpopulations displayed aberrant phenotypes (19 cases). In 17 of the 23 patients (74%) who had two or more blast cell subpopulations with phenotypic aberrations, at least one aberrant criteria was common to all the subpopulations; this criteria by itself would permit the simultaneous identification of all subpopulations in minimal residual disease (MRD) studies.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using BCR and ABL probes showed that in 20% of metaphases BCR and ABL signals were present on one chromosome 6 at 6p23, whilst in 80% of metaphases BCR and ABL signals were identified on both copies of chromosome 6. Furthermore, FISH analysis with a whole-chromosome 22 paint demonstrated that chromosome 22 material was present on both copies of chromosome 6. These data indicate a complex Philadelphia translocation involving chromosome band 6p23 and duplication of the whole aberrant chromosome. The nature of the gene locus on 6p23, involved in this rearrangement, remains unknown. A similar translocation has been previously reported in a case of CML, which also lacked DEK and CAN gene rearrangements implying that abnormalities of 6p23 involving genes other than DEK may be a recurrent abnormality in CML.","['Jadayel, D', 'Calabrese, G', 'Min, T', 'van Rhee, F', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Dyer, M J', 'Maitland, J', 'Palka, G', 'Catovsky, D']","['Jadayel D', 'Calabrese G', 'Min T', 'van Rhee F', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Dyer MJ', 'Maitland J', 'Palka G', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research/Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):981-7.,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR', 'CAN', 'DEK']",,,,,,,,,,

There is some degree of consensus that the mechanism by which IFN-alpha suppresses the Ph+ clone in CML consists in the restoration of normal adhesion of CML progenitors to the marrow stroma, by preventing transcription of the BCR/ABL mRNA, and hence expression of the p210 tyrosine kinase. However, if the 'faulty adhesion' hypothesis, and its correction by IFN-alpha, is to be considered correct, this case proves that it must include also Ph-negative, not BCR-ABL rearranged clonal myeloid proliferations.","['Marmont, A M', 'Sessarego, M']","['Marmont AM', 'Sessarego M']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedale S Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*genetics/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):977-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, little is known regarding the clinical and biological features of ALL cases carrying p53 mutations. In order to help clarify the role of p53 inactivation in ALL development, we have determined the frequency of p53 mutations throughout the molecular spectrum of B cell lineage ALL. We report that p53 inactivation in ALL of B cell lineage is restricted to cases carrying a rearrangement of MLL or c-MYC, whereas it is consistently negative in other molecular subgroups.

Although hematopoietic cells derive from the mesoderm, relatively few studies have addressed the role of bFGF in the hematopoietic system until recently. It appears that bFGF is expressed and produced by bone marrow stromal cells, as well as by cells from several mature peripheral blood lineages. It is released and stored in the bone marrow extra-cellular matrix. FGF-receptors (FGF-Rs) are expressed on nearly every cell of hematopoietic origin tested so far. Growing evidence shows that bFGF can positively regulate hematopoiesis, by acting on various cellular targets: stromal cells, early and committed hematopoietic progenitors, and possibly some mature blood cells. It synergizes with hematopoietic cytokines, or antagonizes the negative regulatory effects of another factor, TGF-beta, thus potentially playing a central role in hematopoiesis.","['Allouche, M']",['Allouche M'],"['Laboratoire CNRS, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mesoderm/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):937-42.,,,,,,74,,,,,,,,

Although T cell lymphomagenesis is prevented, all these mice were shown to carry endogenous ecotropic provirus-induced potential lymphoma cells (PLCs) in a dormant state. The termination of the dormant state, leading to a high incidence of CD5+ IgM+ B cell lymphomas, was triggered by interference with T cell functions (optimal effect observed following in vivo administration of anti-CD8 moAb), administration of T cell growth factors or by injecting the MCF-247 recombinant virus isolate (from AKR origin) that affects T cell functions. The assumption that the PLC dormant state is maintained through specific immunological mechanisms (involving T cells or antibodies recognizing PLCs) could not be substantiated experimentally. The results of the present studies suggest that T cells provide immunoregulatory signals or factors that contribute to the maintenance of the B cell lymphoma arrest and/or proliferation. Analysis of cytokine levels produced by splenocytes taken from mice during PLC dormancy or its breakdown indicated reduced levels of IL-2 and IL-4 and marked elevation of IL-1 and IL-6 associated with the termination of the dormant state. The effect of IL-1 and IL-6 on terminating the dormant state was demonstrated by injecting these cytokines into PLC carriers, thymectomized 12-month-old AKR mice, yielding 80-85% CD5+ IgM+ B cell lymphomas. The role of IL-6 on B cell lymphoma proliferation was also indicated in MCF-247 mediated termination of dormancy, by inhibiting significantly its effect via in vivo administration of anti IL-6 moAbs.","['Peled, A', 'Tzehoval, E', 'Haran-Ghera, N']","['Peled A', 'Tzehoval E', 'Haran-Ghera N']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymectomy']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1095-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a phase I study in patients with advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas or acute myeloid leukemia, the pharmacokinetic parameters of Ara-CMP-Stearate (kindly provided by ASTA Medica, Frankfurt, Germany) were determined by HPLC analysis. Seventy-two hours after a first starting dose which served for the determination of baseline pharmacokinetic parameters, Ara-CMP-Stearate was administered over 14 days by daily oral application. Ara-CMP-Stearate was started at a dose of 100 mg/day and was escalated in subsequent patients to 200 mg/day and 300 mg/day. Plasma and urine concentrations of Ara-CMP-Stearate, Ara-C and Ara-U were measured during the initial treatment phase and within 72 h after the end of the 14-day treatment cycle. So far six patients have been treated with 100 mg/day, three with 200 mg/day and another six with 300 mg/day. One patient was treated consecutively with 100 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg. Fitting the results of the plasma concentration measurements of Ara-CMP-Stearate to a one-compartment model, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained (average and variation coefficient VC). Ara-CMP-Stearate dose-independent parameters: lag time = 1.04 h (0.57); tmax = 5.72 h (0.30); t1/2 = 9.4 h (0.36). Dose-dependent parameters: at 100 mg: AUC = 1099 ng/h/ml (0.31); concentration(max) = 53.8 ng/ml (0.28); at 200 mg: AUC = 2753 ng/h/ml (0.32); concentration(max) = 154.8 ng/ml (0.46); at 300 mg: AUC = 2940 ng/h/ml (0.66); concentration(max) = 160.0 ng/ml (0.59). The long lag time and late tmax can be explained by resorption in the distal part of the small intestine. No Ara-CMP-Stearate was detected in urine samples (limit of detection = 500 pg/ml). Pharmacokinetic parameters of Ara-C following Ara-CMP-Stearate application showed the following characteristics: t1/2 = 24.3 h (0.39); AUC (100 mg) = 262 ng/h/ml (0.93); AUC (200 mg) = 502 ng/h/ml (0.87); AUC (300 mg) = 898 ng/h/ml (1.07). Since Ara-CMP-Stearate causes intravascular hemolysis after intravenous administration, it was not possible to determine its bioavailability by comparing the AUC after oral and i.v. application. Instead, the renal elimination of Ara-U, as the main metabolite of Ara-C was measured during the first 72-h period and after the last application.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Schleyer, E', 'Braess, J', 'Ramsauer, B', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Kaufmann, C', 'Wilde, S', 'Schussler, M', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Schleyer E', 'Braess J', 'Ramsauer B', 'Unterhalt M', 'Kaufmann C', 'Wilde S', 'Schussler M', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', ""3I7U8R8NWC (1-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate)"", 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/urine', 'Arabinonucleotides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cytarabine/urine', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1085-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were then immunostained with the 19A2, 19F4 or PC10 monoclonal antibody against the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The preparations were finally scored for the proportion of unlabeled, double-labeled and single PCNA or 3H-thymidine-labeled nuclei. Unstimulated lymphocytes were immunonegative in all the conditions tested, as also were stimulated lymphocytes checked with an isotype of the primary antibody. A specificity (Sp) and a sensitivity (Se) score was calculated to evaluate the recognition by PCNA staining of the S-phase cells, as defined by the 3H-labeling. The data show that in most instances the three antibodies recognized the 3H-labeled cells with high sensitivity, ie with few false negative, but with low specificity, ie with PCNA positivity extending to variable proportions of non-S-phase cells. By contrast, methanol fixation followed by a brief treatment with the detergent Triton X-100 and immunostaining with either 19F4 or PC10 (but not with 19A2) combined a high sensitivity and specificity scores of the recognition of the 3H-thymidine-labeled cells: PC10 gave a more intense and, hence, more readable reaction. PHA-stimulated lymphocytes that had been preserved at -20 degrees C as cytocentrifuged smears failed to show any immunopositivity for PCNA if not submitted to further fixation prior to the immunocytochemical assay. When methanol-Triton was used for this step, only PC10 gave positive immunoreaction, yet with a lower specificity score (Sp = 76%) than in cells submitted to this fixation-permeabilization procedure without prior cryopreservation (Sp = 91.7%). The PCNA index was measured in cryopreserved, methanol-fixed smears of lymphocytes from patients with various hematological diseases and was compared to the Ki-67 index established independently on a serial sample. A good correlation was found between the two indices (r = 0.79; P < 0.0001) with the PCNA index generally lower than or close to the Ki-67 index. This warrants a note of caution about the use of total (ie stable and labile) PCNA immunostaining to measure the growth fraction (GF), classically defined as the proportion of proliferating cells in a population. However, in the absence of an absolute reference marker for G0 cells, there is no reason to assume that the PCNA index would necessarily be a worse estimate of GF than the Ki-67 index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Galand, P', 'Del Bino, G', 'Morret, M', 'Capel, P', 'Degraef, C', 'Fokan, D', 'Feremans, W']","['Galand P', 'Del Bino G', 'Morret M', 'Capel P', 'Degraef C', 'Fokan D', 'Feremans W']","['Laboratory of Cytology and Experimental Cancerology, Institute for Interdisciplinary Research, RIBHN School of Medicine, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Autoradiography/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Methanol', '*Mitotic Index', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1075-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later procedures may be of lesser importance since they concern a population which may have already been cured by chemotherapy. Alternatively it is not solved if very early BMT gives patients sufficient therapy and provides lower toxicity. To answer this question we analyzed data from the Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle (SFGM) on a sub-group of patients according to the following criteria: (1) Allogeneic BMT carried out on patients with AML in CR1; (2) after January 1985; (3) conditioning with CyTBI; (4) GVHD prophylaxis with MTX-CsA; (5) interval between diagnosis and BMT < 100 days.

Its expression was shown during embryonic development in various tissues as well as in a few human malignancies including acute leukemias. Using RT-PCR, we found wt1 gene expression in blast cells of the majority of 150 acute leukemia patients. Particularly, the wt1 transcript was detected in 12 of 14 (86%) pre-pre-B-ALL patients, in 33 of 41 (80%) cALL patients, in 23 of 31 (74%) T-ALL patients, and in 53 of 57 (93%) AML patients. Additionally, mononuclear cells from CML patients expressed the wt1 gene only when diagnosed with blast crisis. In contrast to acute human leukemias, mononuclear cells from reactive bone marrow (n = 4), and peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (n = 20), as well as normal peripheral CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (n = 6) did not express the wt1 gene at detectable levels. Using the anti-WT1 MoAb 6F-H2 in an immunofluorescence assay on single cell level, we found the translated WT1 protein only in nuclei of leukemia blast cells but not in nuclei of normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Blast cells of 12 of 20 leukemia patients (60%) all tested positive for the wt1 gene expression by RT-PCR displayed a strong nuclear immunofluorescence. Its expression in the majority of human acute leukemias but not in normal mononuclear blood cells and normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors qualifies the wt1 gene transcript as a 'pan-acute leukemic' marker probably useful in monitoring minimal residual disease after chemotherapy and in detecting leukemic blast cells in purged or unpurged hematopoietic stem cell preparations intended to be used for autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Menssen, H D', 'Renkl, H J', 'Rodeck, U', 'Maurer, J', 'Notter, M', 'Schwartz, S', 'Reinhardt, R', 'Thiel, E']","['Menssen HD', 'Renkl HJ', 'Rodeck U', 'Maurer J', 'Notter M', 'Schwartz S', 'Reinhardt R', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Benjamin Franklin Klinik, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1060-7.,,,['CA-25871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['wt1'],,,,,,,,,,

For instance, the productive rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene has been demonstrated to be essential for the response of BCP cells to IL-7 as the single proliferation stimulus. IL-7 activates a receptor that consists of the IL-7R protein and the common gamma chain (gamma c). BCP acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells variably respond to IL-7. Among 72 cases of BCP-ALL IL-7 activated DNA synthesis in 34. In four cases inhibition of DNA synthesis was seen. In the remaining 38 cases IL-7 exerted no effects. We determined whether this heterogeneity in IL-7 response could be correlated with parameters that could influence the IL-7 response. Firstly we show that, in contrast to the murine BCP cells, the IL-7 response of human BCP-ALL cells did not correlate with the status of IgH chain gene rearrangement and expression, nor with the rearrangement of IgL chain genes. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that IL-7R protein and transcripts as well as gamma c transcripts are equally present in the IL-7 responsive and nonresponsive BCP-ALL samples, indicating that the defective expression of these chains could not be held responsible for IL-7 response failures. Finally, we observed that kit ligand (KL), known to synergize with IL-7 in the most primitive stages of normal B cell development, did not enhance the IL-7 responses of BCP-ALL cells.","['Smiers, F J', 'van Paassen, M', 'Pouwels, K', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Hahlen, K', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['Smiers FJ', 'van Paassen M', 'Pouwels K', 'Beishuizen A', 'Hahlen K', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","[""Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1039-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resulting DNA damage can lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cell death by apoptosis. The sensitivity of five human leukemic cell lines to topo I (camptothecin or CPT) and topo II (etoposide or VP-16) inhibitors varied widely (100-fold for CPT and 30-fold for VP-16). Three cell lines were more sensitive (BV173, HL60, U937) and two cell lines were resistant (K562, KCL22) to both drugs. None of these cell lines were selected for drug resistance and overexpressed mdr1 gene. Their sensitivity was not related to their doubling time nor to cell cycle repartition. The initial DNA damage (cleavable complexes) induced by topo I and II inhibitors was measured as DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) using alkaline elution. Neither DPC level induced by 30-min treatment with CPT or VP-16 nor the levels of topo 1, topo II alpha and topo II beta mRNA were related to sensitivity. Electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation measured by filter elution and agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that apoptosis was induced by both drugs in the five cell lines. The kinetics of DNA fragmentation was related to cell sensitivity. At drug concentrations higher than IC50, DNA fragmentation increased very rapidly in the three sensitive, compared with the two resistant, cell lines. Continuous exposure to both drugs induced cell cycle arrest in either G2 or S phase that was related both to cell sensitivity and drug concentration. Comparison between cell lines indicated that the ability of cells to arrest cell cycle in G2 or S phase was related to their drug sensitivity and increased with cell resistance. In a given cell line, cell cycle progression was observed to be progressively inhibited by increasing drug concentrations. Treatment of synchronized cells demonstrated that highly cytotoxic drug concentration induced a complete inhibition of cell cycle progression. Altogether, these data suggest that the ability of leukemic cell lines to regulate cell cycle progression and to trigger apoptosis is more indicative of their sensitivity to topoisomerase poisons than cleavable complexes induced by these drugs.","['Dubrez, L', 'Goldwasser, F', 'Genne, P', 'Pommier, Y', 'Solary, E']","['Dubrez L', 'Goldwasser F', 'Genne P', 'Pommier Y', 'Solary E']","['Laboratory of Onco-Hematology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Camptothecin/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jun;9(6):1013-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of the cultured CML T lymphocytes in close contact with autologous BMMNC resulted in significant, dose-related suppression of autologous CFU-MIX and BFU-E colonies (P < 0.001). Close contact between effectors and targets was important for progenitor suppression. Progenitor suppression was mediated by CD4-positive T lymphocytes. In contrast to the significant suppression of autologous progenitors by CML T lymphocytes, T lymphocytes from normal bone marrow did not suppress autologous progenitors.

Patients were divided into two groups according to their API, low (< or = 0.4) or high (> 0.4). Autonomous growth was observed in 84% of cases studied (82% in de novo ANLL, 75% secondary to MDS and 100% secondary to MPD). The group with the highest API (29 patients) had increased levels of hemoglobin (P = 0.006) and platelets (P = 0.01). A high API was also associated with an immature phenotype of blast cells (P = 0.02).

Pretreatment cytogenetic studies were available for 90 (78%) of the 115 patients who proceeded to BMT. Patients were categorized by diagnosis (ALL/AML/CML), disease status ['good' risk = second complete remission (CR2) or CML-accelerated phase (AP); 'poor' risk = third complete remission (CR3), induction failure, florid relapse or CML-blast phase (BP)] and cytogenetic status (favorable = normal cytogenetics in AL or Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) standard or variant translocation as the sole findings in CML; unfavorable = all other cytogenetic aberrations). Chromosomal aberrations observed in the unfavorable category included -7, t(9;22) in AL, t(8;21) in association with complex karyotypes, t(6;9), del(9q), t/del(11q), t(1;19), hypotetraploidy, and complex karyotypes (> 3 cytogenetic anomalies). Unfavorable cytogenetic status was significantly more frequent among patients with 'poor' risk clinical disease status (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly poorer for patients with unfavorable cytogenetic status (P = 0.002) but not significantly related to disease status (P = 0.43). These data indicate that certain secondary chromosome aberrations [+8,i(17q), duplication of Ph] should be reclassified as relatively favorable predictors of successful BMT in CML and, therefore, be separated from the unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations characteristic of drug resistant disease [-7, inv(3), complex karyotypes]. The limited number of patients precluded definitive assessment of the prognostic significance of specific cytogenetic aberrations for any single diagnosis. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that cytogenetic status may be an important and independent factor in predicting outcome following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Slovak, M L', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Wolman, S R', 'Henslee-Downey, J P', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Forman, S J', 'Blume, K G']","['Slovak ML', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Wolman SR', 'Henslee-Downey JP', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Forman SJ', 'Blume KG']","['Department of Cytogenetics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)00162-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00162-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Jun;19(6):381-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00162-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a group of 127 AML/MDS patients who received IDA-based induction and postremission or salvage therapy and achieved a complete remission (CR) that lasted > or = 12 weeks for the development of IDA-related congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF was defined as definite if a resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < or = 45% measured by radionuclide ventriculogram (RV) accompanied the clinical diagnosis of CHF, which had to be made during or within 6 months of receiving IDA and for which no other cause was apparent; without RV confirmation, the diagnosis was considered probable. Patients who had RVs performed were evaluated for decreasing LVEF. Older age (> or = 70 years), prior/sequential anthracycline/mitoxantrone (anthraquinone) therapy, and cardiac disease/hypertension were evaluated as risk factors for the development of CHF. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were assessable (median age, 40 years; median dose, 96 mg/m2). Sixty-five had RVs performed during therapy; 43 had risk factors. The probability of IDA-related cardiomyopathy was 5% at a cumulative IDA dose of 150 to 290 mg/m2, with 18 patients receiving doses greater than 150 mg/m2. At a cumulative IDA dose of 150 mg/m2, the probability of a mild or greater asymptomatic decrease probability of a mild or greater asymptomatic decrease in LVEF (> or = 10% to a level < or = 50%) was 18%, whereas the probability of a moderate or greater asymptomatic decrease in LVEF (> or = 15% to a level < or = 45%) was 7%. No patient with asymptomatic LVEF decreases developed CHF. CHF was more frequent in patients with prior/sequential exposure to anthracyclines/mitoxantrone (P = .01). CONCLUSION: In this patient group, IDA-related cardiomyopathy was uncommon with cumulative IDA doses of up to 290 mg/m2. Asymptomatic LVEF decreases were more frequent, but their predictive value for the development of CHF is unclear.","['Anderlini, P', 'Benjamin, R S', 'Wong, F C', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Kornblau, S M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Mackay, B', 'Ewer, M S', 'Pierce, S A']","['Anderlini P', 'Benjamin RS', 'Wong FC', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau SM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Mackay B', 'Ewer MS', 'Pierce SA', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2827 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Nov;13(11):2827-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2827.,,,['P01-CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-two patients admitted for leukemia in different stages of disease were evaluated whenever they presented with PTE-related acute respiratory failure (ARF). Diagnosis was based on a perfusional lung scan and a digital pulmonary angiography in most cases. When necessary, patients with ARF were transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiorespiratory monitoring and support. Thrombolytic treatment was usually performed with urokinase at a loading dose of 2,000 to 4,560 IU/kg as single bolus followed by 2,000 to 4,530 IU/kg/h for 12 to 42 hours. Before thrombolytic therapy was discontinued, heparin was started at a daily dose of 100 to 500 IU/kg as a continuous infusion and continued for 6 to 26 days. RESULTS: Twelve of 452 children developed 17 PTE episodes, which were resolved completely after appropriate therapy in 15 cases. Univariate analysis showed a statistical correlation between PTE and the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (P < .001). No major bleeding was observed after thrombolytic treatment. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that PTE is not an extremely rare event in children with leukemia and should be ruled out when sudden tachypnea develops in patients with risk factors such as previous tumor lysis, central venous catheter (CVC) malfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and drug-induced pulmonary toxicity. Complete resolution of PTE may be obtained in a high proportion of cases with early diagnosis and proper treatment.","['Uderzo, C', 'Faccini, P', 'Rovelli, A', 'Arosio, M', 'Marchi, P F', 'Riva, A', 'Marraro, G', 'Balduzzi, A', 'Masera, G']","['Uderzo C', 'Faccini P', 'Rovelli A', 'Arosio M', 'Marchi PF', 'Riva A', 'Marraro G', 'Balduzzi A', 'Masera G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Embolism/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombolytic Therapy']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2805 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Nov;13(11):2805-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report concerns previously untreated patients with newly diagnosed pPNET deemed poor-risk because of a tumor volume more than 100 cm3 or metastases to bone or bone marrow. The P6 protocol consists of seven courses of chemotherapy. Courses 1, 2, 3, and 6 include 6-hour infusions of cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 2 for a total of 4,200 mg/m2 per course (140 mg/kg per course for patients < 10 years old), plus 72-hour infusions of doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 and vincristine 2.0 mg/m2 beginning on day 1 (HD-CAV). Courses 4, 5, and 7 consist of 1-hour infusions of ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2/d and etoposide (VP-16) 100 mg/m2/d, for 5 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and mesna are used. Courses start after neutrophil counts reach 500/microL and platelet counts reach 100,000/uL. Surgical resection follows course 3 and radiotherapy follows completion of all chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among the first 36 consecutive assessable patients (median age, 17 years), HD-CAV achieved excellent histopathologic or clinical responses in 34 patients and partial responses (PRs) in two patients. For 24 patients with locoregional disease, the 2-year event-free survival rate was 77%; adverse events were two locoregional relapses, one distant relapse, and one secondary leukemia. All six patients with metastatic disease limited to lungs achieved a complete response (CR) and did not relapse; one is in remission 36+ months from diagnosis, but the other patients are not assessable in terms of long-term efficacy of the P6 protocol because of short follow-up time (n = 3), additional systemic therapy (bone marrow transplantation), or septic death (autopsy showed no residual pPNET). All six patients with widespread metastases had major responses, including eradication of extensive bone marrow involvement, but distant relapses ensued. Myelosuppression was severe, but most patients received the first three courses of HD-CAV within 6 to 7 weeks. Major nonhematologic toxicities were mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Excellent antitumor efficacy and manageable toxicity support the dose-intensive use of HD-CAV for pPNET in children, as well as in young adults. Consolidation of remissions of pPNET metastatic to bone and bone marrow remains a therapeutic challenge.","['Kushner, B H', 'Meyers, P A', 'Gerald, W L', 'Healey, J H', 'La Quaglia, M P', 'Boland, P', 'Wollner, N', 'Casper, E S', 'Aledo, A', 'Heller, G']","['Kushner BH', 'Meyers PA', 'Gerald WL', 'Healey JH', 'La Quaglia MP', 'Boland P', 'Wollner N', 'Casper ES', 'Aledo A', 'Heller G', 'et al.']","['Department of Medical Imaging, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'CAV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2796 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Nov;13(11):2796-804. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.11.2796.,,,['CA61017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The problem lies in the complexity of human lymphoma, which encompasses more than a dozen neoplasms of the lymphoid system. The goal of this review is to provide user-friendly access to the condition. METHODS: The variety of inputs required for a subdivision of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is useful to clinicians includes lymphocyte lineage and sublineage based on microscopic appearance and immunophenotype, clinical behavior manifest in survival and early dissemination, and analysis of molecular genetic and cytogenetic abnormalities, which reflect pathogenic oncogene derangements. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are important in certain uncommon lymphomas. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The subtypes of primary B-lineage nodal lymphoma include low-grade (small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoplasmacytoid, follicular small cleaved cell, and follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell), intermediate-grade (follicular large cell, diffuse small cleaved or mixed, and intermediate lymphocytic), and high-grade (diffuse large cell, immunoblastic, and small noncleaved cell) neoplasms. The less common lymphomas of T lineage and lymphomas that arise in extranodal sites are placed in separate subdivisions. This subdivision serves as a guide to prognosis and treatment.","['Aisenberg, A C']",['Aisenberg AC'],"['Hematology/Oncology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/etiology/*therapy']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2656 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2656-75. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2656.,,,,,,196,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh leukemic cells from 14 AML patients (nine APL and five non-APL), were incubated in suspension culture in the absence or presence of 10(-6) mol/L ATRA. Intracellular ATRA concentration and ATRA metabolism was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Immediate uptake is observed with maximal intracellular levels (Cmax) achieved after 24 hours of incubation. At this time, ATRA levels were variable, ranging from 20 to 230 pmol/10(6) cells (median, 100 pmol/10(6) cells). Comparison of ATRA intracellular levels with the in vitro response of patients' cell samples as measured by the percentage of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells after a 3-day incubation period allowed us to discriminate a group of APL patients (n = 6) with high Cmax (group A; median, 200 pmol/10(6) cells) and maximal differentiation at day 3 (median, 80%), and a group of patients (n = 8, three APL and five non-APL) with low Cmax (group B; median, 35 pmol/10(6) cells) and poor in vitro response (median, 40%; APL cases only). Interestingly, all APL patients, except one included in group A (rapid in vitro ATRA uptakers), achieved a complete remission. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that intracellular ATRA concentrations are determinant for ATRA response and should be taken into account when monitoring the efficacy of ATRA differentiation therapeutic trials in malignant disorders.","['Agadir, A', 'Cornic, M', 'Lefebvre, P', 'Gourmel, B', 'Jerome, M', 'Degos, L', 'Fenaux, P', 'Chomienne, C']","['Agadir A', 'Cornic M', 'Lefebvre P', 'Gourmel B', 'Jerome M', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2517 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2517-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2517.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Final height (FH) and pubertal growth were retrospectively examined in 142 young adult survivors of childhood ALL. All were in first remission and had received either 18 or 24 Gy of cranial irradiation. Eighty-four children (48 girls) were treated with 24 Gy and 58 (35 girls) with 18 Gy. None had received either testicular or spinal irradiation. Timing and duration of puberty were studied in 110 patients. RESULTS: Significant reduction in height standard deviation score (SDS) from diagnosis to FH was seen in both sexes and in both dose groups. In girls, in both dose groups, mean age at peak height velocity (PHV) and mean age at menarche occurred significantly earlier than in the normal population. In boys, there was a normal timing of PHV. The amplitude of PHV was significantly reduced in both sexes and in both dose groups. Parameters of pubertal duration (PHV to menarche, PHV to FH, and menarche to FH) were not significantly different from normal population values. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, puberty occurred early in girls, but not in boys. Amplitude of PHV was reduced in both sexes, with no reduction in the duration of puberty. It is likely that disturbances of both timing and quality of growth during puberty contribute to the loss of standing height and body disproportion seen in these children.","['Didcock, E', 'Davies, H A', 'Didi, M', 'Ogilvy Stuart, A L', 'Wales, J K', 'Shalet, S M']","['Didcock E', 'Davies HA', 'Didi M', 'Ogilvy Stuart AL', 'Wales JK', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Child Health, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'UKALL X protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Menarche/radiation effects', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Puberty/*radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2503 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2503-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica.,2497-502,"PURPOSE: To assess the effect of treatment intensification and that of extended intrathecal methotrexate substitution for cranial irradiation in intermediate-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children treated with a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-based intensive chemotherapy. PATIENTS: Three hundred ninety-six children with non-B-ALL were enrolled onto the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologic Pediatrica (AIEOP) ALL 88 study. Standard risk (SR) included patients with low tumor burden (BFM risk index [RI], < 0.8); intermediate risk (IR) were patients with an RI > or = 0.8 but less than 1.2; and high risk (HR) were those with an RI > or = 1.2 or CNS involvement at diagnosis. The treatment schedule was a modified version of the ALL-BFM 86 study. CNS-directed treatment consisted of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX; 5 g/m2 for four courses) plus intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX; nine doses); IR patients additionally received extended IT-MTX (nine doses during continuation therapy); cranial irradiation was given only to HR patients. RESULTS: Of the 375 (94.7%) children who achieved remission, 1.3% had an adverse event other than relapse. The estimated event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years was 66.6% (SE 2.4) overall; 80.7% (4.5) in the SR patients, 77.5% (3.9) in the IR patients, and 54.5% (3.7) in the HR patients. Relapse occurred in 107 children (27.0%). Isolated CNS relapse occurred in 20 children (5.0%): 5 (6.3%) in the SR group, 1 (0.8%) in the IR group, and 14 (7.1%) in the HR group. The estimated 6-year CNS leukemia-free survival was 94.6% (1.2) overall: 93.5% (2.8) in the SR group, 99.1% (0.9) in the IR group, and 92.3% (2.0) in the HR group. CONCLUSION: Cranial irradiation may be omitted safely in IR ALL patients treated with BFM-based intensive chemotherapy when extended intrathecal chemotherapy is given. Because the CNS disease control was less complete in the SR group, these data challenge the effectiveness of HD-MTX for protection from CNS disease and support the protective role of extended intrathecal chemotherapy.","['Conter, V', 'Arico, M', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Rizzari, C', 'Testi, A M', 'Messina, C', 'Mori, P G', 'Miniero, R', 'Colella, R', 'Basso, G']","['Conter V', 'Arico M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Rizzari C', 'Testi AM', 'Messina C', 'Mori PG', 'Miniero R', 'Colella R', 'Basso G', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2497 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2497-502. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2497.,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2480-2.

CNS therapy consisted of cranial irradiation (CRT) or no radiation. Children were also randomized to single intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) or conventional-dose methotrexate (CD-MTX) during induction, and all patients received intrathecal (IT) and systemic continuation chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients treated for ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocol 87-01 were evaluated by standardized cognitive and achievement tests. These children had been assigned at diagnosis to a standard-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR) group and received no CRT or 18 Gy CRT, respectively. All patients were randomized to receive MTX during remission induction, either as CD-MTX (40 mg/m2) or HD-MTX (4 g/m2) with leucovorin rescue. RESULTS: There was no difference in cognitive outcomes between radiated and unirradiated patients (P > .4). However, the HD-MTX/CRT combination was associated with decreased intelligence quotient (IQ estimate, 9.3 points) for girls only (P < .08). A specific deficit in verbal coding and memory was documented for all patients (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: We conclude the following: (1) 18 Gy CRT per se was not an independent toxic agent for cognitive outcome; (2) HD-MTX during induction was associated with IQ decline in girls, but only when it was followed by CRT; and (3) impairment of verbal memory and coding was a consistent finding that was independent of CRT, which implicates some component of chemotherapy, possibly prednisone, as a CNS toxin.","['Waber, D P', 'Tarbell, N J', 'Fairclough, D', 'Atmore, K', 'Castro, R', 'Isquith, P', 'Lussier, F', 'Romero, I', 'Carpenter, P J', 'Schiller, M']","['Waber DP', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Fairclough D', 'Atmore K', 'Castro R', 'Isquith P', 'Lussier F', 'Romero I', 'Carpenter PJ', 'Schiller M', 'et al.']","[""Division of Psychology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Sex Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2490 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2490-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.10.2490.,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2480-2.

We show that LIF and IFN-gamma activate STAT proteins but only LIF activates VIP gene transcription. Thus STAT activation is not sufficient for VIP transcriptional activation. In a CyRE reporter plasmid, in which the STAT site has been deleted, LIF, but not IFN-gamma, activates transcription, indicating that sequences within the CyRE distinct from the STAT site are important to LIF-mediated transcriptional activation. The CyRE does not mediate transcriptional activation to LIF in a non-VIPergic cell line, suggesting that cell-specific factors exist which are permissive for cytokine-dependent regulation of gene expression. Human and mouse sequences are highly conserved in the region of the CyRE, consistent with the functional importance of multiple regions of the CyRE. These findings show that regions within the CyRE distinct from the STAT site are important to the LIF-dependent regulation of VIP gene expression and enable the CyRE to respond in a cell-specific and cytokine-specific manner.","['Symes, A J', 'Corpus, L', 'Fink, J S']","['Symes AJ', 'Corpus L', 'Fink JS']","['Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*genetics']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1995.65051926.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1995 Nov;65(5):1926-33. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1995.65051926.x.,,,['NS27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/S79785'],,,,,,,,,

Disruption of PML bodies also occurs during herpes simplex virus infection after the immediate early protein Vmw110 has become associated with PML bodies. In this study, we followed the fate of PML bodies in human fibroblasts during the course of a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Disruption of PML bodies was observed to be dependent on de novo CMV gene expression and to occur within 4 h post-infection, concomitant with the onset of CMV IE gene expression. Although a transient increase in the number of PML bodies could be observed in some cells, PML exists predominantly as a diffuse nuclear protein during both the early and late stages of CMV infection. Although the function of PML bodies is still uncertain, their disruption may be important for efficient herpes virus replication.","['Kelly, C', 'Van Driel, R', 'Wilkinson, G W']","['Kelly C', 'Van Driel R', 'Wilkinson GW']","['Department of Medicine, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*physiology/radiation effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Viral Proteins']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-76-11-2887 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1995 Nov;76 ( Pt 11):2887-93. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-76-11-2887.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon interaction with MHC class II molecules, SEA triggers several cellular events leading to cytokine gene expression. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, contrary to wild-type SEA, stimulation of the THP1 monocytic cell line with SEA mutated at position 47 (SEAF47A) or at position 227 (SEAD227A) failed to induce interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha messenger RNA expression. Pretreatment of the cells with a 10-fold excess of either SEAF47A or SEAD227A prevented the increase in cytokine messenger RNA induced by wild-type SEA. However, cross-linking of SEAF47A or SEAD227A bound to MHC class II molecules with F(ab')2 anti-SEA mAb leads to cytokine gene expression, whereas cross-linking with F(ab) fragments had no effect.

In contrast, the CD40 antigen provides a potent activation and survival signal to B lymphocytes when it is engaged by its T cell ligand (CD40L, gp39) or cross-linked by anti-CD40 antibody. In this study, we use human tonsillar B cells and the Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line, which serves as a model for human germinal center B lymphocytes, to study the effectors of Apo-1/Fas expression and apoptosis of human B cells. We found that Apo-1/Fas expression was upregulated on both malignant and normal human B lymphocytes after CD40 ligation induced by (a) cognate T helper-B cell interaction mediated by microbial superantigen (SAg); (b) contact-dependent interaction with CD40L+, but not CD40L- Jurkat mutant T cell clones; and (c) monoclonal anti-CD40, but not any of a panel of control antibodies. Enhanced B cell Fas/Apo-1 expression is functionally significant. Coculture of Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma line cells with irradiated SAg-reactive CD4+ T cells with SAg or CD40L+ Jurkat T cells results in B cell apoptosis, evidenced by reduced cell viability and DNA laddering. This process is augmented by the addition of anti-Apo-1/Fas monoclonal antibody, consistent with an acquired susceptibility to Apo-1/Fas-mediated apoptosis. These data support an immunoregulatory pathway in which seemingly contradictory signals involving the B cell proliferation/survival antigen CD40, as well as the Apo-1/Fas molecule, which mediates programmed cell death of lymphocytes, are linked in the process of human B cell activation.","['Schattner, E J', 'Elkon, K B', 'Yoo, D H', 'Tumang, J', 'Krammer, P H', 'Crow, M K', 'Friedman, S M']","['Schattner EJ', 'Elkon KB', 'Yoo DH', 'Tumang J', 'Krammer PH', 'Crow MK', 'Friedman SM']","['Department of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.182.5.1557 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Nov 1;182(5):1557-65. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.5.1557.,,,"['AI32634/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50AR 42588/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2192191,,,,,,,

The majority of PCD seen in higher organisms exhibits strikingly similar morphological features, and this form of PCD has been termed apoptosis. The nature of the PM changes that occur on apoptotic cells remains poorly defined. In this study, we have used a phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding protein (annexin V) as a specific probe to detect redistribution of this phospholipid, which is normally confined to the inner PM leaflet, during apoptosis. Here we show that PS externalization is an early and widespread event during apoptosis of a variety of murine and human cell types, regardless of the initiating stimulus, and precedes several other events normally associated with this mode of cell death. We also report that, under conditions in which the morphological features of apoptosis were prevented (macromolecular synthesis inhibition, overexpression of Bcl-2 or Abl), the appearance of PS on the external leaflet of the PM was similarly prevented. These data are compatible with the notion that activation of an inside-outside PS translocase is an early and widespread event during apoptosis.","['Martin, S J', 'Reutelingsperger, C P', 'McGahon, A J', 'Rader, J A', 'van Schie, R C', 'LaFace, D M', 'Green, D R']","['Martin SJ', 'Reutelingsperger CP', 'McGahon AJ', 'Rader JA', 'van Schie RC', 'LaFace DM', 'Green DR']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', '*Phospholipid Transfer Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.182.5.1545 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Nov 1;182(5):1545-56. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.5.1545.,,,"['GM52735/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,PMC2192182,,,,,,,

Here we report a novel mechanism of complement-mediated type C retrovirus inactivation that is initiated by the binding of ""natural antibody"" [Ab] (anti-alpha-galactosyl Ab) to the carbohydrate epitope Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R expressed on the retroviral envelope. Complement-mediated inactivation of amphotropic retroviral particles was found to be restricted to human and other Old World primate sera, which parallels the presence of anti-alpha-galactosyl natural Ab. Blockade or depletion of anti-alpha-galactosyl Ab in human serum prevented inactivation of both amphotropic and ecotropic murine retroviruses. Similarly, retrovirus was not killed by New World primate serum except in the presence of exogenous anti-alpha-galactosyl Ab. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the alpha-galactosyl epitope was expressed on the surface of amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses, and Western blot analysis further localized this epitope to the retroviral envelope glycoprotein gp70. Finally, down-regulation of this epitope on the surface of murine retroviral particle producer cells rendered them, as well as the particles liberated from these cells, resistant to inactivation by human serum complement. Our data suggest that anti-alpha-galactosyl Ab may provide a barrier for the horizontal transmission of retrovirus from species that express the alpha-galactosyl epitope to humans and to other Old World primates. Further, these data provide a mechanism for the generation of complement-resistant retroviral vectors for in vivo gene therapy applications where exposure to human complement is unavoidable.","['Rother, R P', 'Fodor, W L', 'Springhorn, J P', 'Birks, C W', 'Setter, E', 'Sandrin, M S', 'Squinto, S P', 'Rollins, S A']","['Rother RP', 'Fodor WL', 'Springhorn JP', 'Birks CW', 'Setter E', 'Sandrin MS', 'Squinto SP', 'Rollins SA']","['Department of Molecular Development, Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., New Haven, Connecticut 06511, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Blood/immunology/*virology', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cebidae/blood/*immunology', 'Cercopithecidae/blood/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Galactose/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mammals/blood/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*immunology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.182.5.1345 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Nov 1;182(5):1345-55. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.5.1345.,,,,,,,PMC2192220,,,,,,,

Expression of hCD8 markedly enhanced responses to both HLA class I molecules and hybrid A2/Kb molecules providing functional evidence for a second interaction site, outside of the alpha 3 domain, which is essential for optimal coreceptor function. Peripheral T cell expression of hCD8 was sufficient to augment responsiveness to HLA class I, as hCD8 Tg mice which lacked thymic expression responded as well as mice expressing hCD8 in the thymus and periphery. Both murine CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing hCD8 transgenes exhibited markedly enhanced responses to foreign HLA class I, revealing the ability of T cell receptor repertoires selected on either murine class I or class II to recognize human class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In contrast to recognition of foreign class I, thymic expression of hCD8 transgenes was absolutely required to enhance recognition of antigenic peptide restricted by self-HLA class I. Thus, our studies revealed disparate requirements for CD8 coreceptor expression in the thymus for selection of a T cell repertoire responsive to foreign MHC and to antigenic peptides bound to self-MHC, providing a novel demonstration of positive selection that is dependent on human CD8.","['LaFace, D M', 'Vestberg, M', 'Yang, Y', 'Srivastava, R', 'DiSanto, J', 'Flomenberg, N', 'Brown, S', 'Sherman, L A', 'Peterson, P A']","['LaFace DM', 'Vestberg M', 'Yang Y', 'Srivastava R', 'DiSanto J', 'Flomenberg N', 'Brown S', 'Sherman LA', 'Peterson PA']","['Department of Immunology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Orthomyxoviridae/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/immunology', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', '*Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.182.5.1315 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Nov 1;182(5):1315-25. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.5.1315.,,,"['HL-07195-16/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 32068/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 25803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2192222,,,,,,,

However, combinations of the two factors resulted in at least 3- to 20-fold greater amounts of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha than would have been predicted by additive mechanisms. This enhanced cytokine production was observed when M-CSF and IFN-gamma were added simultaneously or when M-CSF was added 24 h after addition of IFN-gamma to the cells. Similar results were obtained with fresh human peripheral blood cells treated with IFN-gamma + M-CSF. Cycloheximide treatment of the cultures containing M-CSF and IFN-gamma inhibited the production of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Northern blotting studies revealed no effect of IFN-gamma alone on IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha mRNA production. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was observed at 2 and 6 h after treatment with M-CSF or IFN-gamma + M-CSF. Higher TNF-alpha mRNA expression was observed at 2 and 6 h after treatment with IFN-gamma + M-CSF, and higher IL-1 beta mRNA expression was observed at 2 h after treatment with IFN-gamma + M-CSF compared with mRNA levels observed for cells cultured only with M-CSF. These results suggest that the augmented cytokine production resulting from treatments with combinations of M-CSF and IFN-gamma occurs due to increased cytokine mRNA and increased cytokine protein synthesis. In addition to up-regulating cytokines, combinations of IFN-gamma and M-CSF resulted in augmented cell surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. This was accompanied by morphological and functional changes that included plastic adherence, extensive homotypic aggregation, and a macrophage-like appearance. These phenotypic changes and enhancements in cytokine expression and cell surface molecule expression may be related to activation of monocytic cells to become cytotoxic effectors by M-CSF and IFN-gamma combinations. In vitro cytotoxicity against A-375 melanoma cells was greatest for cultures that contained M-CSF and IFN-gamma in combination.","['Kimball, E S', 'Kovacs, E', 'Clark, M C', 'Schneider, C R']","['Kimball ES', 'Kovacs E', 'Clark MC', 'Schneider CR']","['Oncology and Endocrinology Research, Janssen Research Foundation, Spring House, Pennsylvania 19477-0776, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-1/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.58.5.585 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 Nov;58(5):585-94. doi: 10.1002/jlb.58.5.585.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gb4 was identified as a major neutral GSL in 11 tissues, especially in those of mesodermal origin.

These transfectants revealed that the true specificity of both monoclonal antibodies was for TCRBV23S1 (V beta 23), a result that was confirmed by several other techniques. We show that the original determination as a V beta 1 specificity was due to a crossreactive oligonucleotide used to type the immunizing cell line. The oligonucleotide amplified the V beta 1 as well as the closely related V beta 23 sequence, while the antibodies, by contrast, react exclusively with the beta chain encoded by the V beta 23 subfamily of the T cell receptor.

Binding analyses of the T101 monoclonal antibody to Jurkat cells and freshly isolated human peripheral T lymphocytes were performed and Scatchard plots revealed Kd values of 1.4 and 1.2 pM, respectively. To introduce DNA into the T cell, a complex of T101-polylysine and the luciferase plasmid was formed (T101-PL-DNA). 125I-labeled antibody alone or T101-PL-DNA complexes were both shown to internalize. Subcellular fractionation indicated that the complex remained in the endosomal compartment of the cell for up to 90 min. However, with the addition of adenovirus particles, there was a decrease of labeled complex in the endosomal fraction over time suggesting it was no longer 'tethered' to the endosome vesicle. In vitro transfections confirmed this result showing the addition of adenovirus particles during incubation resulted in increased expression of the luciferase protein. Without adenovirus, there was limited expression of the transduced gene. These data revealed that T101 can deliver DNA via an antibody-PL conjugate.

Our experiments showed that both CD59 and CD55 were associated with the external membrane of HTLV-I derived from MT2 cells, since virus could be captured by mAbs to these proteins, and antisera to CD55 and CD59 induced C-mediated lysis of HTLV-I virions. Additionally, both CD55 and CD59 were detected by immunoblot analysis of purified HTLV-I. Purified HCMV produced in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) also contained both CD55 and CD59, as detected by immunoblot analysis. However, treatment with anti-CD55, but not anti-CD59, reduced the HCMV infectious titer in the presence of C. Additional studies determined whether HTLV-I-associated CD55 and CD59 participated in the resistance of the virus to C-mediated lysis. Treatment of virus with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which removes glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD55 and CD59, increased the sensitivity of HTLV-I to C-mediated destruction in the presence of anti-HTLV-I Abs. Reconstitution of PI-PLC-treated virus with purified CD55 and CD59 restored resistance to C. These experiments show that HTLV-I and HCMV acquire C control proteins from host cells. Together with our previous experiments showing that both CD55 and CD59 are present on HIV-1, these studies demonstrate a mechanism by which a variety of enveloped viruses may acquire resistance to C-mediated destruction.","['Spear, G T', 'Lurain, N S', 'Parker, C J', 'Ghassemi, M', 'Payne, G H', 'Saifuddin, M']","['Spear GT', 'Lurain NS', 'Parker CJ', 'Ghassemi M', 'Payne GH', 'Saifuddin M']","[""Department of Immunology/Microbiology, Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['CD55 Antigens/analysis/*metabolism/physiology', 'CD59 Antigens/analysis/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Complement Inactivator Proteins/analysis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Virion/immunology/*metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Nov 1;155(9):4376-81.,,,"['AI 29661/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 31812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have cloned JAK3, which unlike other known family members (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells but not in a variety of other cells. Functionally, JAK3 and JAK1 are coupled to the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 in T cells and NK cells. Because of the importance of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 in B cell physiology, we sought to determine whether JAK3 was also present in B lymphocytes and whether it was involved in signaling via cytokines that are important for B cell development and function. In this report, we demonstrate that JAK3 is expressed in normal human peripheral blood B cells at levels that are comparable to those in T cells. In addition, the levels were found to be markedly up-regulated following stimulation with staphylococcal protein A Cowan and anti-CD40 Abs. In addition, IL-4 and IL-7 induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and JAK1, and IL-4 activated both JAK3 and JAK1 phosphotransferase activity. JAK3 protein was also detected in immature B cell lines, but not in more well differentiated cell lines. Additionally, JAK3 was detected in lysates from bone marrow lymphoblasts of patients with B cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia and cell lines derived from human B cell lymphomas. Together, these data suggest that the regulation of JAK3 expression and activity is likely to be important in B cell development and function.","['Tortolani, P J', 'Lal, B K', 'Riva, A', 'Johnston, J A', 'Chen, Y Q', 'Reaman, G H', 'Beckwith, M', 'Longo, D', 'Ortaldo, J R', 'Bhatia, K', 'McGrath, I', 'Kehrl, J', 'Tuscano, J', 'McVicar, D W', ""O'Shea, J J""]","['Tortolani PJ', 'Lal BK', 'Riva A', 'Johnston JA', 'Chen YQ', 'Reaman GH', 'Beckwith M', 'Longo D', 'Ortaldo JR', 'Bhatia K', 'McGrath I', 'Kehrl J', 'Tuscano J', 'McVicar DW', ""O'Shea JJ""]","['Lymphocyte Cell Biology Section, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Interleukin-7/immunology', 'Interleukins/*immunology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Dec 1;155(11):5220-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A regional, tertiary, referral cancer center and its supportive care university teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 316 consecutive adult oncology patients who underwent Hickman catheter placement from 1986 to 1990 at a regional oncology center. HCRI was determined on the basis of clinical information incriminating the Hickman catheter as the source of infection. Patient characteristics and data about HCRIs (exit site cellulitis, tunnel infection with concomitant exit site cellulitis, bloodstream infection, and exit site cellulitis with bloodstream infection) were abstracted from patient medical records. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate analyses for the risk of HCRI and catheter removal were completed. RESULTS: The incidence of first HCRI was 5.98 infections per 1,000 catheter days. Overall, 156 (49%) of 316 patients developed their first HCRI prior to catheter removal. The median time to HCRI was 90 days. Male gender (P = .0004) and hematologic malignancy (P = .0001) emerged as significant risk factors for HCRI in the univariate analysis. A cox model verified that male gender (P = .02) and hematologic malignancy (P = .004) were associated with an enhanced risk of HCRI. There were 35 exit site infections (23%), three infections of the tunnel and the exit site (2%), 80 bloodstream infections (51%), and another 38 bloodstream infections with concomitant exist site infections (24%). The incidence of bloodstream infection was 3.05 per 1,000 catheter days. Gram-positive pathogens outnumbered gram-negatives and fungi, with Staphylococcus epidermidis being most common. Fifty (32%) of 156 HCRIs resulted in catheter removal. Predictors of Hickman catheter removal in the univariate analysis were bloodstream infection (P = .046) and pathogen type (P = .006). Multiple regression analysis suggested that having a gram-negative (P = .014) or fungal (P = .057) pathogen was the most important factor for catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that first HCRIs occur more commonly in male patients with hematologic malignancies than in patients with solid tumors. The removal of Hickman catheters in oncology patients probably is predicated on the causative pathogen, but further investigations are necessary to delineate this issue.","['Rotstein, C', 'Brock, L', 'Roberts, R S']","['Rotstein C', 'Brock L', 'Roberts RS']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cross Infection/*microbiology', '*Equipment Contamination', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*microbiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Wound Infection/*microbiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1086/648362 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1995 Aug;16(8):451-8. doi: 10.1086/648362.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This immunotherapeutic agent is a cytokine inducer and may induce an autologous graft-versus-host (GVH) and graft-versus-tumor reactions. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine patients undergoing this immunotherapy for clinical signs and symptoms of acute GVH reactions and to correlate these symptoms with their clinical outcome. METHODS: We studied eight patients receiving requinimex therapy. RESULTS: We found autologous GVH reactions in three of eight patients (38%) treated with this immunotherapy. Their disease was manifested by localized or widespread violaceous papules that on histologic evaluation were compatible with a grade II GVH reaction. The acute cutaneous GVH reaction was associated with eccrine sweat gland necrosis, a dermatologic toxicity usually associated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Long-term studies of larger numbers of patients treated with this immunotherapy will determine whether these GVH reactions confer significant, sustained, antitumor effects.","['Gaspari, A A', 'Cheng, S F', 'DiPersio, J F', 'Rowe, J M']","['Gaspari AA', 'Cheng SF', 'DiPersio JF', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '372T2944C0 (roquinimex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyquinolines/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Sweat Glands/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0190-9622(95)91806-X [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(95)91806-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1995 Nov;33(5 Pt 1):711-7. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(95)91806-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies from several laboratories have indicated that Tax, a trans-regulatory protein from the human T cell leukemia virus type I not only augments viral gene expression but also triggers the expression of various cellular genes. Here, we examined the hypothesis that the expression of collagen genes may also be modulated by Tax. NIH-3T3 cells were simultaneously transfected with a Tax expressor plasmid and a chimeric construct containing regulatory sequences (-804 to +42 bp) of the alpha 1(I) procollagen gene (COL1A1) promoter. The results indicated that the promoter activity of the -804 to bp COL1A1 fragment increased up to 12-fold in cells expressing Tax. Deletion analysis revealed that the region of COL1A1 encompassing nucleotides -174 to -84 contained the Tax-responsive elements. A gene segment encompassing nucleotides -187 to -67, which contained this region, proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility (2.5-fold) to a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Stably transfected NIH-3T3 cell clones that constitutively produce Tax displayed elevated levels of alpha 1(I) procollagen and fibronectin transcripts and increased production and accelerated processing of type I procollagen. These findings suggest that retroviral proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic diseases accompanied by collagen overproduction.","['Munoz, E', 'Suri, D', 'Amini, S', 'Khalili, K', 'Jimenez, S A']","['Munoz E', 'Suri D', 'Amini S', 'Khalili K', 'Jimenez SA']","['Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Procollagen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118298 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Nov;96(5):2413-20. doi: 10.1172/JCI118298.,,,"['AI-28272/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-19616/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC185893,,,,,,,

The same phenomenon was observed on the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line. alpha v beta 1 upmodulation was concomitant with improved tumor cells attachment to the fibronectin matrix. This greater adhesion of tumor cells to fibronectin was inhibited by specific monoclonal antibodies against alpha v or beta 1 integrin subunits. Similar results were obtained after TNF-alpha treatment.

In a previous report we demonstrated the induction of early messages and antigens, as well as the formation of giant polyploid cells in the cultures (Majumdar et al., 1994, J. Cell. Physiol., 160:29-39). Here we show high level induction of messages for the late markers, Platelet Factor 4, GMP140 (P-Selectin), thrombospondin, and beta thromboglobulin. The induced cells are also positive for these antigens by immunocytochemical analysis. The high level message induction resulted from synergy between the inducers. Pretreatment of the cells with IL-3 could accelerate the rise in message seen with the inducer combination. The increase in differentiation markers was accompanied by a reduction of the proliferative capacity of the cells. Riboguanosine, which has anti differentiation activity, blocked the induction of early and late antigens by the inducer combination, and also by IL-3 acting alone, but did not block the reduction in proliferative competence. In this model of megakaryocytic differentiation IL-3 treatment yields an initial stimulation of growth followed by growth suppression, and is the principal driver of the differentiation process.

Caffeine synergistically potentiated cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation or carboplatin (CPt), but attenuated induction of apoptosis by daunorubicin (DNR) in KG-1a cells. Since caffeine released irradiated as well as DNR-treated KG-1a cells from G2M cell cycle arrest and CPt-treated cells from S-phase arrest, this release does not fully explain the different effects of caffeine. Caffeine synergistically reduced the level of the apoptosis inhibitor glutathione after irradiation or CPt treatment. In contrast, treatment with DNR plus caffeine diminished glutathione levels to a lesser extent than DNR alone. We conclude that the effect of caffeine on glutathione depletion represents a mechanism of action by which caffeine can modulate apoptosis. Caffeine increased CPt cytotoxicity in K562 cells and its doxorubicin-resistant subline (K562/ADM), but little effect was seen in HL-60 cells or mononuclear cells from leukemic patients.

Growth of one of these variants (L1210/R69), with metoprine in the presence of decreasing concentrations of 1,L5-CHO-folateH4 (natural diastereoisomer of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate), resulted in the selection of other variants (L1210/R82, R83, and R84) with further reduction in one-carbon, reduced folate transport and in two cases (L1210/R83 and R84) with 3-8-fold increased folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity and folate compound polyglutamate formation in situ. Metoprine resistance was further increased, and the requirement for exogenous folate during growth was decreased as well in these variants.

Northern blotting revealed the same increases in these two variants in the level of a 2.3-kilobase FPGS mRNA when compared with control, while Southern blotting of genomic DNA did not reveal any increase in FPGS gene-copy number or restriction polymorphisms. Also, no difference in stability of FPGS mRNA was found between parental and variant cells. In contrast, nuclear run-on assays revealed differences among these cell types in the rate of FPGS mRNA transcription that correlated with increased FPGS activity, protein, and mRNA level in the variants. Similar studies with a transport-defective, methotrexate-resistant L1210 cell variant (L1210/R25) documented a 2-3-fold decrease in FPGS activity, protein, and mRNA levels that was accounted for by a decrease in FPGS mRNA transcription.

Implications of GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors for lysosphingolipids.,26332-40,"Extracellular sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) induced Ca2+ mobilization in a dose-dependent manner in HL60 leukemia cells. The rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) elicited by SPC and psychosine at concentrations lower than 30 microM was inhibited by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) and U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, as was the case for UTP, a P2-purinergic agonist. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by these lysosphingolipids was associated with inositol phosphate production, which was also sensitive to PTX and U73122. The inositol phosphate response is not secondary to the increase in [Ca2+]i as evidenced by the observation that thapsigargin and ionomycin, Ca2+ mobilizing agents, never induced inositol phosphate production and, unlike lysosphingolipids, the [Ca2+]i rise by these agents was totally insensitive to PTX and U73122. When HL60 cells were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, inositol phosphate and Ca2+ responses to AlF4- were enhanced, probably reflecting an increase in the amount of Gi2 and Gi3 compared with undifferentiated cells. In the neutrophil-like cells, however, the responses to SPC and psychosine were markedly attenuated. This may exclude the possibility that the lysosphingolipids activate rather directly PTX-sensitive GTP-binding proteins or the phospholipase C itself. Other lysosphingolipids including glucosylsphingosine (glucopsychosine) and sphingosylgalactosyl sulfate (lysosulfatides) at 30 microM or lower concentrations also showed PTX- and U73122-sensitive Ca2+ mobilization and inositol phosphate response in a way similar to SPC and psychosine. However, platelet-activating factor and lysoglycerophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidic acid were less effective than these lysosphingolipids in the induction of Ca2+ mobilization. Taken together, the results indicate that a group of lysosphingolipids at appropriate doses induces Ca2+ mobilization through inositol phosphate production by phospholipase C activation. The lysosphingolipids-induced enzyme activation may be mediated by PTX-sensitive GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors, which may be different from previously identified platelet-activating factor receptor or lysophosphatidic acid receptor.","['Okajima, F', 'Kondo, Y']","['Okajima F', 'Kondo Y']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Lysophospholipid)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '10216-23-6 (sphingosine phosphorylcholine)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '2238-90-6 (Psychosine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lysophospholipids/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Psychosine/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*physiology', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Lysophospholipid', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Uridine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1995/11/03 00:00,1995/11/03 00:01,['1995/11/03 00:00'],"['1995/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.44.26332 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)92482-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Nov 3;270(44):26332-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.44.26332.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the interaction between alpha 5 beta 1 and fibronectin as a model system, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the effects of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ on ligand binding. Each cation had distinct effects on the ligand-binding capacity of alpha 5 beta 1:Mn2+ promoted high levels of ligand binding, Mg2+ promoted low levels of binding, and Ca2+ failed to support binding. Studies of the effects of different combinations of cations on ligand binding indicated that the cation-binding sites within alpha 5 beta 1 are not all identical, or of broad specificity, but instead each site shows a distinct preference for one or more cations. Ca2+ strongly inhibited Mn(2+)-supported ligand binding, but this inhibition was noncompetitive, suggesting that Ca2+ recognizes different cation-binding sites to Mn2+. In contrast, Ca2+ acted as a direct competitive inhibitor of Mg(2+)-supported ligand binding, implying that Ca2+ can displace Mg2+ from the integrin. However, low concentrations of Ca2+ greatly increased the apparent affinity of Mg2+ for its binding site, suggesting the existence of a distinct high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site.

These proteins have opposing effects on cell survival when overexpressed in cells, with Bcl-2 blocking and Bax promoting apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that gene transfer-mediated elevations in Bcl-2 protein levels result in a marked increase in the steady-state levels of endogenous p21Bax protein as determined by immunoblotting in the Jurkat T-cell and 697 pre-B-cell leukemia cell lines, but not in several other cell lines including CEM T-cell leukemia, 32D.3 myeloid progenitor, PC12 pheochromocytoma, and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Steady-state levels of p21Bax protein were also elevated in the lymph nodes of Bcl-2 transgenic mice in which a BCL-2 transgene is expressed at high levels in B-cells. Northern blot analysis of BCL-2-transfected and control-transfected Jurkat and 697 leukemia cells revealed no Bcl-2-induced alterations in the steady-state levels of BAX mRNAs. In contrast, L-[35S]methionine pulse-chase analysis indicated a marked increase in the half-life (t1/2) of the p21Bax protein in BCL-2-transfected 697 cells compared to control-transfected cells (t1/2 > 24 h versus approximately 4 h), whereas the rate of Bax degradation was unaltered in Bcl-2-transfected CEM cells. The results demonstrate that levels of the proapoptotic p21Bax protein can be post-translationally regulated by Bcl-2, probably in a tissue-specific fashion, and suggest the existence of a feedback mechanism that may help to maintain the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax protein in physiologically appropriate ranges.","['Miyashita, T', 'Kitada, S', 'Krajewski, S', 'Horne, W A', 'Delia, D', 'Reed, J C']","['Miyashita T', 'Kitada S', 'Krajewski S', 'Horne WA', 'Delia D', 'Reed JC']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Hippocampus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PC12 Cells', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1995/11/03 00:00,1995/11/03 00:01,['1995/11/03 00:00'],"['1995/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.44.26049 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)92439-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Nov 3;270(44):26049-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.44.26049.,,,['CA-60381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant fusion protein from this chimeric gene contains the DNA-binding homeodomain of Pbx1. The first and only functional Pbx1 binding site has been localized in bovine CYP17 to a sequence (CRS1) that participates in cAMP-dependent transcription of this gene encoding the steroid hydroxylase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P450. Because Pbx1 is not expressed in pre-B cells, it may be possible that the E2a-Pbx1 fusion protein expressed in pre-B cells having this translocation will activate, in response to cAMP, transcription of genes not normally expressed in these cells leading to arrest of differentiation at the pre-B cell stage. We have now shown that reporter genes comprising CRS1 are activated transcriptionally by protein kinase A (PKA) in the pre-B cell line 697, which endogenously expresses the fusion protein, and that overexpression of E2A-Pbx1 in additional cell lines enhances transcription of reporter genes in a PKA-dependent fashion.

The congenital absence of the receptor results in a bleeding disorder associated with ""giant"" platelets, a condition linking the expression of the complex to platelet morphogenesis. To understand better the expression of the GP Ib-IX-V complex, studies were undertaken to define the essential genetic elements supporting the expression of the alpha-subunit of the complex (GP Ib alpha). GP Ib alpha promoter activity was evaluated by transfection of human erythroleukemia cells with reporter plasmids coding for the enzyme, luciferase. Studies were initiated with a fragment extending 2,738 nucleotides 5' to the transcription start site and lead to the identification of 253 nucleotides retaining full promoter activity in human erythroleukemia cells. In cells of nonhematopoietic lineage, human endothelial and HeLa cells, the GP Ib alpha promoter activity was no greater than background levels obtained with promoterless constructs. Gel shift assays and site-directed mutagenesis studies defined essential GATA and Ets binding motifs 93 and 150 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, a finding which further substantiates these elements as important determinants of megakaryocytic gene expression.

The Tf-mediated iron uptake was profoundly inhibited by weak bases, the protonophore monensin, energy depletion, or low temperatures (< 25 degrees C), all properties characteristic of RME. Cell iron levels were affected by the slowly permeating chelator desferrioxamine only after prolonged incubations. Conversely, rapidly penetrating, lipophilic iron-(II) chelators such as 2,2'-bipyridyl, evoked swift increases in cell calcein fluorescence, equivalent to sequestration of 0.2-0.5 microM cytosolic iron, depending on the degree of pre-exposure to Tf. Addition of iron(III) chelators to permeabilized 2,2'-bipyridyl-treated cells, failed to reveal significant levels of chelatable iron(III). The finding that the bulk of the in situ cell chelatable pool is comprised of iron(II) was corroborated by pulsing K562 cells with Tf-55Fe, followed by addition of iron(II) and/or iron(III) chelators and extraction of chelator-55Fe complexes into organic solvent. Virtually all of the accumulated 55Fe in the chelatable pool could be complexed by iron(II) chelators. The cytoplasmic concentration of iron(II) fluctuated between 0.3 and 0.5 microM, and its mean transit time through the chelatable pool was 1-2 h. We conclude that after iron is translocated from the endosomes, it is maintained in the cytosol as a transit pool of chelatable iron(II). The ostensible absence of chelatable iron(III) implicates the intracellular operation of vigorous reductive mechanisms.","['Breuer, W', 'Epsztejn, S', 'Cabantchik, Z I']","['Breuer W', 'Epsztejn S', 'Cabantchik ZI']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/*pharmacology"", 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/13 00:00,1995/10/13 00:01,['1995/10/13 00:00'],"['1995/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.41.24209 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)57513-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Oct 13;270(41):24209-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.41.24209.,,,['AI20342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase has several roles during this process. We have examined RNase H cleavages that define the maximal 3' and 5' ends of Moloney murine leukemia virus minus strand DNA prior to the second template jump. In both the endogenous reaction and on model substrates in vitro, RNase H cleaves the genomic RNA template between the second and third ribonucleotides 5' of the U5/PBS junction, but other minor cleavages between 1 and 10 nucleotides 5' of this junction are also observed. Similar experiments examining the specificity of RNase H for tRNA primer removal revealed that cleavage generally leaves a ribo A residue at the 5' end of minus strand DNA. These observations suggest that three bases are typically duplicated on the ends of the minus strands, leading to an intermediate following the second jump which contains unpaired nucleotides. Model substrates mimicking the structure of this intermediate demonstrate that reverse transcriptase has little difficulty in utilizing such a branched structure for the initiation of displacement synthesis.","['Schultz, S J', 'Whiting, S H', 'Champoux, J J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Whiting SH', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Genome, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic']",1995/10/13 00:00,1995/10/13 00:01,['1995/10/13 00:00'],"['1995/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.41.24135 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)57503-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Oct 13;270(41):24135-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.41.24135.,,,"['5T32GM07266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

N-(3-aminopropyl)cyclohexylamine (APCHA) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (4MCHA) were used as inhibitors of spermine and spermidine synthases, respectively. Combination of DFMO and APCHA showed strong inhibitory effects on the growth of FM3A cultured cells and P388 leukemia cells in mice, compared with DFMO alone. The prolongation of survival time of P388 leukemia-bearing mice by DFMO (1,500 mg/kg) was 1.12-fold, while that by DFMO (1,500 mg/kg) plus APCHA (25 mg/kg) was 1.30-fold. The prolongation of survival time nearly paralleled the decrease of P388 leukemia cells in mice. However, the antiproliferative effect of DFMO was not strengthened by 4MCHA in the above two experimental systems. In the FM3A cell culture system, both putrescine and spermidine contents were decreased by DFMO, but spermine content did not decrease significantly. When APCHA was added to the medium with DFMO, spermine content was decreased greatly but a compensatory increase in spermidine was observed. Spermidine content in P388 leukemia cells was also decreased by DFMO, the increase in spermine was suppressed but a compensatory increase in spermidine was observed. Nevertheless, the spermidine content remained significantly low compared with the value in non-treated P388 leukemia cells. Thus, the results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of DFMO was strengthened by APCHA due to the decrease in spermine content, and that the decrease in total amount of spermidine and spermine, especially the decrease in spermine, is necessary for inhibition of cell growth.","['He, Y', 'Shimogori, T', 'Kashiwagi, K', 'Shirahata, A', 'Igarashi, K']","['He Y', 'Shimogori T', 'Kashiwagi K', 'Shirahata A', 'Igarashi K']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '6321-23-9 (4-methylcyclohexylamine)', 'EC 2.5.1.16 (Spermidine Synthase)', 'EC 2.5.1.22 (Spermine Synthase)', 'F4XOB09FKN (N-(3-aminopropyl)cyclohexylamine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclohexylamines/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eflornithine/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spermidine Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spermine Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124782 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1995 Apr;117(4):824-9. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSC product manipulations to remove NRBC were unnecessary. As assessed by post-collection NRBC: WBC ratio as a percent of the initial ratio, Spectra selectively harvested mononuclear leukocytes over NRBC. The collected products had a mean NRBC: WBC ratio that was 3.4% of the peripheral blood ratio. Adequate numbers of mononuclear leukocytes were collected with less than 6% NRBC contamination.

Among those cured of the disease by orchiectomy and postoperative irradiation, there is a risk of having a second malignancy. We conducted a study to determine the relative risk of the occurrence of secondary malignancy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1964 through 1988, 128 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage seminoma of the testis underwent orchiectomy and postoperative irradiation at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, and affiliate hospitals. The follow-up periods ranged from 5 to 29 years, with a median of 11.7 years. The expected rate of developing a second cancer was computed by the standardized incidence ratio using the Connecticut Tumor Registry Database. The rate is based on the number of person-years at risk, taking into account age, gender, and race. RESULTS: Nine second nontesticular malignancies were found; the time of appearance in years is indicated in brackets: two squamous cell carcinomas of the lung [3, 11], one adenocarcinoma of the rectum [15], one chronic lymphocytic leukemia [2], one adenocarcinoma of the pancreas [14], one diffuse histiocytic lymphoma of the adrenal gland [7], one sarcoma of the pelvis [5], and two transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter [14, 17]. One patient who developed a contralateral testicular tumor was excluded from risk assessment. The actuarial risk of second nontesticular cancer is 3%, 5%, and 20%, respectively, at 5, 10, and 15 years of follow-up. When compared with the general population, the overall risk of second nontesticular cancer in the study group did not reach the 0.05 significance level, with an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-3.35). When analyzed by the latency period after radiation treatment, during the period of 11 to 15 years, the risk was higher (O/E ratio of 4.45, 95% confidence interval, 1.22-11.63) than expected.

A total of 46 U937-derived subclones in suspension was isolated and classified into three (2 high, 42 middle, and 2 low) types based on their susceptibility to the infection. By analyzing subclones before infection, we found that the high-type subclones expressed LFA-1 antigens at a relatively low level. In addition, the ability of these subclones to induce adherence after exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was reduced. In contrast, a transition by HIV-1 infection to adherent macrophage-like cells was induced only in the high-type, but not in the low-type subclones. The high-type adherent cells obtained by HIV-1 infection were followed by further lineage to become retrodifferentiated suspension cells showing reduced syncytia formation ability. Superoxide was generated in the high-type subclones, without PMA-mediated differentiation, from the early stage of infection before HIV-1 replication, as well as during undifferentiated, differentiated and retrodifferentiated stages. In contrast, it was only transiently generated at acute phase of HIV-1 replication in low-type subclones. Long-term culture of the low-type subclones decreased the expression of major structural viral protein Gag and also virus production. Thus, the mechanism by which PMA differentiates U937 cells is not the same as that induced by HIV-1 infection. The latter mechanism results in high susceptibility to infection. The HIV-1 phenotypes of finally obtained persistently infected cells were also affected by the cell stages at the time of infection.","['Kameoka, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Okada, Y', 'Nakaya, T', 'Kishi, M', 'Ikuta, K']","['Kameoka M', 'Kimura T', 'Okada Y', 'Nakaya T', 'Kishi M', 'Ikuta K']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'HIV Infections/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016231099500012I [pii]', '10.1016/0162-3109(95)00012-i [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 1995 Jun;30(1):89-101. doi: 10.1016/0162-3109(95)00012-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variously differentiated intermediate stages were generated in U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. When these cells were infected with lymphotropic HIV-1, the kinetics of the production of HIV-1 DNA, the appearance of HIV-1 antigen-positive cells, and viral production in the conditioned media were slower at higher doses of PMA. This different susceptibility to the infection was not due to the rate of HIV-1 adsorption. Viral replication from latency in the differentiated cells was activated in proportion with the retrodifferentiation observed in long-term cultures of the host cells. Thus, our data demonstrate the close correlation between the regulation of HIV-1 replication and the differentiation stage of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells at the time of HIV-1 infection.

When RBL-2H3 cells are sensitized with IgE antibody and subsequently stimulated by an antigen, significant histamine release and the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins are observed. In this study, we examined the effects of a synthetic naphthalene derivative, (7E)-N-(2-carboxyphenyl)-8-(2-naphthyl)-5,6-trans-5,6-methano-7-++ +octenamide (TEI-6472), on the Fc epsilon RI-mediated histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells. Preincubation for 10 min with 100 microM TEI-6472 caused significant inhibition of Fc epsilon RI-mediated histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that Fc epsilon RI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 78 and 92 kDa proteins in RBL-2H3 cells was also significantly inhibited. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these 78 and 92 kDa proteins was not induced by direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore A23187. However, the inhibition of histamine release from TEI-6472-treated RBL-2H3 cells was restored by direct activation of PKC. Taken together, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 78 and 92 kDa proteins in RBL-2H3 cells is involved in a signal transduction system for histamine secretion, and that these tyrosine phosphorylations may occur upstream of PKC activation.","['Miyamoto, H', 'Matsui, K', 'Arai, T']","['Miyamoto H', 'Matsui K', 'Arai T']","['Department of Microbiology, Meiji College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin conjugate)', '107761-24-0 (ST 638)', '151379-49-6 (TEI 6472)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Cinnamates/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Haptens/immunology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['019205619500011P [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(95)00011-p [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1995 May;17(5):433-41. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(95)00011-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only one complete proviral DNA sequence is reported from a TSP/HAM patient, with a provirus derived from immortalized lymphocytes, which might be expected to be a leukemogenic variant rather than a neurotropic one. We cloned and sequenced a complete HTLV-I provirus (HTLV-IBoi) derived from the uncultured lymphocytes of a sub-acute post-transfusional TSP/HAM patient with clonal integration of HTLV-I. HTLV-IBoi proviral genome is 9033 bp long, and its overall genetic organization is similar to that of the prototype HTLV-I(ATK), without major deletions or insertions. No premature termination codon was found in the 4 open reading frames of the pX region. Divergence at the nucleotide level of HTLV-IBoi from the reported full-length HTLV-I varies from 1 to 9.4%, and indicates that it corresponds to a cosmopolitan genotype. This study did not identify specific sequences associated with neurotropic strains.","['Bazarbachi, A', 'Huang, M', 'Gessain, A', 'Saal, F', 'Saib, A', 'Peries, J', 'De The, H', 'Galibert, F']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Huang M', 'Gessain A', 'Saal F', 'Saib A', 'Peries J', 'De The H', 'Galibert F']","['UPR43 CNRS, Retrovirus et Retrotransposons des vertebres, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/*virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910630406 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Nov 15;63(4):494-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910630406.,,,,,['GENBANK/L36905'],,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to determine the capacity of OSM in modulating LIF production by human tumor cells and to provide a better definition of the interactions between these two molecules during inflammatory reaction due to neoplasia. LIF content in culture supernatants was assayed by a specific ELISA (sensitivity: 25 pg/ml). In vitro exposure to recombinant OSM increased LIF production 2 to 6-fold in all human melanoma cell lines tested. This effect was not limited to melanoma cell types since LIF production was also enhanced by an MDA breast undifferentiated adenocarcinoma line. Moreover, a synergistic effect was observed for OSM and TNF-alpha. LIF increase was apparently due to up-modulation through LIF synthesis since LIF transcript expression was also enhanced in these tumor cell lines. It is concluded that OSM can induce inflammatory reaction not only directly but also via LIF production by tumor cells.","['Heymann, D', 'Blanchard, F', 'Raher, S', 'De Groote, D', 'Godard, A']","['Heymann D', 'Blanchard F', 'Raher S', 'De Groote D', 'Godard A']","['INSERM (U211), Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Melanoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016524789500049B [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(95)00049-b [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1995 Jun;46(3):245-51. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(95)00049-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all A20 transfectants tested expressed the high-affinity hIL-4R, A20 transfectants expressing the mutant hIL-4R, which contains only 8 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, did not respond to LPS and hIL-4 with germline C epsilon transcripts. In addition, A20 transfectants expressing an internally deleted hIL-4R, in which the deleted region has been identified as the critical region for growth signal transduction in the previous study, failed to induce germline C epsilon transcripts with LPS and hIL-4.

The production of antibodies to the cleaved env glycoprotein gp46 was verified by analysis of immunized rabbit sera as well as HTLV-II infected human sera using Western blotting. Moreover, the rabbit antibody was shown to suppress syncytial formation of the cells (Vines) infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II: HTLV-II-Vines). HTLV-II infection in rabbits was produced by intravenous injection of HTLV-II-Vines into female rabbits (New Zealand White). Antibody against HTLV-II could be detected by the 2nd week after inoculation, and its titer reached the maximum at the 10th week. Specific antibodies against env gp46 and gag p24 were detected in 2 of 2 rabbits and in 1 of 2 by Western blotting methods, respectively. Proviral DNA was detected by nested PCR, which was verified by Southern hybridization, at all times checked after inoculation, suggesting the persistence of infection, albeit at low levels.

Employing nested PCR, the provirus could not be detected at any time after challenge. The observation that active immunization could effectively protect rabbits from infection would seem to have important implications for equivalent vaccination of humans against both HTLV-I and HTLV-II.","['Kawamura, N']",['Kawamura N'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'HTLV-II Antibodies', 'HTLV-II Infections/*prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Vaccination']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1995 Jul;70(4):635-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, may be involved in modulating cellular signal transduction, morphological and structural changes, the microtubules assembly of multidrug resistant cells was examined using Confocal Laser Microscope MRC500 system (Bio Rad). In this study, multidrug resistant cells were established by the continuous exposure to ADR(adriamycin) starting with 20 nM up to 1 microM. The expression of MDR-1 (multidrug resistance) gene was detected in K562 leukemia cells and to more extent in the multidrug resistant K562/ADR cells, but not in HL-60 leukemia cells and multidrug resistant HL-60/ADR cells by RT-PCR method. The chronological features of microtubules assembly in the parent cell lines were lost on day 3, after incubation with 20nM of ADR. In accordance with development of drug resistance, the microtubules assembly appeared to be more dense and stronger than that of parent cells. During the development of drug resistant cells, the ADR-accumulation in the nucleus was decreased according to the increase of microtubules assembly. In the case of incubation with 0.5 microM colcemid, an inhibitor of microtubules polymerization, for 3 hours, the stainings of microtubules were lost their fine network and appeared to be diffuse and dot-like pattern. At the same time, both untreated HL-60/ADR and K562/ADR showed the decrease of ADR-accumulation, but the accumulations both colcemid treated resistant cells were increased the same level of their parent cells at the point of 120 min. These results suggested that the resistance to ADR in human leukemia cells correlated with microtubules assembly, and the microtubules assembly played an important role of drug resistance with or without MDR-1 gene overexpression.","['Hara, N']",['Hara N'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microtubules/*physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1995 Jul;70(4):573-89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein exhibits sequence similarity to homeotic genes, contains several polyproline stretches, and includes a src homology 3 (SH3) domain at its very carboxyl terminus that is required for binding to Abl proteins. The abi-1 gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 2 and is genetically closely linked to the c-abl locus. The gene is widely expressed in the mouse, with highest levels of mRNA found in the bone marrow, spleen, brain, and testes. The Abi-1 protein coimmunoprecipitates with v-Abl and serves as a substrate for kinase activity. When overexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells, abi-1 potently suppresses the transforming activity of Abelson leukemia virus expressing the full-length p160v-abl kinase but does not affect the transforming activity of viruses expressing a truncated p90v-abl or v-src kinases.

Typically, transcription of c-myb is down-regulated during haemopoietic cell differentiation, and it has been found in several erythroid and myeloid cell lines that constitutive c-myb expression, from a transfected plasmid, blocks this differentiation process. To investigate further the activity of c-myb in haemopoietic cell differentiation, we have transfected Friend murine erythroleukaemia (F-MEL) cells with plasmids encoding conditionally active c-Myb/oestrogen receptor (Myb/ER) fusion proteins. Transcriptional activity of the Myb/ER fusion proteins was found to be strictly hormone-dependent, and this property was correlated with the ability of these proteins to inhibit erythroid differentiation. From analysis of a Myb/ER protein that lacks the c-Myb transactivation domain, it was apparent that the C-terminal ER transactivation domain could substitute for that of c-Myb in inhibition of differentiation. Activation of Myb/ER in F-MEL cells had no effect upon the early and transient inhibition of entry into S phase associated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induction. Further analyses of alpha-globin and PU.1 gene transcription suggested that c-Myb is unable to influence gene expression immediately following DMSO-induction and that inhibition of F-MEL cell differentiation must therefore result from the function of c-Myb in the post-commitment period. Nonetheless, c-Myb had effects on the erythroid differentiation programme that were clearly dissociated from its role in cell proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lyon, J J', 'Watson, R J']","['Lyon JJ', 'Watson RJ']","[""Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60803-3 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1995.5930171.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1995 Oct;59(3):171-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1995.5930171.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of K 562 cells, a human chronic myelocytic leukaemia cell line, in suspension culture with TNF for up to 6 h caused an initial increase in cell-membrane fluidity, which returned to the control level after 12 h of treatment. After 24 h of treatment, the cell-membrane fluidity had decreased and this decrease was maintained after 48 h of treatment. In Daudi cells, a human malignant lymphoma cell line, TNF, did not induce any changes in cell-membrane fluidity, indicating that the effect of TNF on membrane structure is cell-specific. The early and transient change in membrane fluidity in K 562 cells is probably related to signal generation, while the later, persistent change may reflect the phenotype of TNF-treated cells, in particular, changes in the plasma membrane-cytoplasmic complex.

As detected by immunocytochemistry using 25 different monoclonal antibodies, the in vitro cultured cells express a variety of adhesion molecules and differentiation antigens. beta 1 and beta 2 integrins are constantly present on long-term cultured cells. CD4, CD54, CD58, and CD71 markers become highly expressed on the cells after about 10 days in vitro while CD56 is permanently lacking.

There was a decrease to less than 10 per cent after six to eight weeks in culture. In later stages of long-term culture, monocytes/macrophages become the dominating cell types. Blast cells are admixed to these cells in varying numbers. In 4 of the 17 cases studied long-term cultures converted to cell lines showing indefinite cell growth. The cells were identified as B cell blasts spontaneously transformed by Epstein Barr virus (EBV).

SETTING: A university-based tertiary referral center (The Toronto Hospital). INTERVENTIONS: Nontransferable human embryos (n = 473) at the two- to six-cell stage were obtained from patients undergoing IVF and were split randomly into five groups. Embryos in group A (n = 164) were cultured as the control group in Ham's F-10 (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY) + 10% human sera. Embryos in groups B, C, D, and E (n = 54, 78, 87, and 80, respectively) were cultured in the same medium supplemented with human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor in four different concentrations (5, 7.5, 10, and 20 ng/mL, respectively). Morphological assessment of embryo development was recorded daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Human blastocyst formation. RESULTS: No significant difference was detected in the rate of blastocyst formation of embryos in the study groups when compared with embryos in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 5 to 20 ng/mL of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor in standard medium does not enhance in vitro human blastocyst formation. It is possible that recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor may play a role at later stages of human embryogenesis and during implantation.","['Jurisicova, A', 'Ben-Chetrit, A', 'Varmuza, S L', 'Casper, R F']","['Jurisicova A', 'Ben-Chetrit A', 'Varmuza SL', 'Casper RF']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Toronto Hospital Research Institute, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Blastocyst/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0015-0282(16)57918-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Fertil Steril. 1995 Nov;64(5):999-1002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adriamycin-resistant cell line (HOB1/ADR) demonstrated resistance to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents including MDR drugs (Vinca alkaloids and anthracycline), antimicrotubule drug (colchicine), and DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin and mitomycin C). The expression of human mdr1 gene, as analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, revealed a 13-15-fold increase in resistant cells. Unexpectedly, HOB1/ADR cells demonstrated a lack of reduced accumulation and of enhanced efflux of adriamycin. More than 60% adriamycin was effluxed at the same rate in both cell lines within 10 min. In contrast, the initial rate of vincristine accumulation was reduced by 3 fold in this resistant cell line. The maximal level of vincristine accumulation was 50% lower in the resistant cells than the parental cells. The maximal efflux rate was enhanced by 5 fold in the resistant cells. Inhibition of vincristine resistance by verapamil associated with restoration of drug accumulation, suggesting that acquired resistance in these cells is due to P-glycoprotein. These studies demonstrated that immunoblastic B lymphoma cells selected for adriamycin resistance preferentially developed P-glycoprotein-mediated vincristine efflux which plays an important role in vincristine resistance. In contrast, the resistant cells did not elevate adriamycin efflux, suggesting an additional mechanism responsible for adriamycin resistance.","['Chao, C C']",['Chao CC'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Chang Gung Medical College, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1995/10/16 00:00,1995/10/16 00:01,['1995/10/16 00:00'],"['1995/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(95)01063-K [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)01063-k [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1995 Oct 16;373(3):285-90. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(95)01063-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the subgroups of MPDs, the stimulatory effect of MGF was significant in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythosis (ET) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). MGF was the most potent single factor in PV, while GM-CSF was most effective in idiopathic myelofibrosis and both IL-3 and GM-CSF in CML. The fact that the ability of MGF to induce colony growth varied between the subgroups of MPDs may mean that the target progenitors in these diseases are biologically different. In conclusion, MGF, either alone or with others, was a potent growth factor for GM progenitors in MPDs.","['Siitonen, T', 'Zheng, A', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Koistinen, P']","['Siitonen T', 'Zheng A', 'Savolainen ER', 'Koistinen P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Thrombocytosis/blood']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb00262.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1995 Oct;55(4):228-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb00262.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adhesive interaction between M-MOK and HEL-O was crucial for viability; once HEL-O was removed from the culture, mortality was total within a few days. On HEL-O cells, M-MOK could be passaged for more than 2 years. With regard to surface marker profile, the established cells were positive for CD11a, CD13, CD18, CD33, CD34, CD41b, CD42b, CD54, and c-kit antigens, but negative for HLA class II antigen and glycophorin. Histochemically, the cells were negative for myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterase, and naphthol ASD chloroacetate esterase staining. Electron-microscope examination revealed the cells to be negative for platelet peroxidase (PPO). After induction of differentiation by a phorbol ester, however, the cells were demonstrated to be positive for PPO with a morphological change to megakaryocytes. From these results, M-MOK was considered to represent an immature cell line of megakaryocyte lineage. Studies of the mechanisms sustaining the HEL-O-dependent continuous in vitro growth of M-MOK cells revealed the following results: (1) M-MOK could grow even when separated from HEL-O by a nucleopore membrane; (2) conditioned medium (CM) from HEL-O supported the growth of M-MOK for more than 1 month without feeder cells; (3) the growth of M-MOK on HEL-O or CM supplement was nearly entirely inhibited by anti-GM-CSF (1 microgram/mL); (4) GM-CSF mRNA was detected in HEL-O cells; and (5) HEL-O was found to secrete GM-CSF into the culture medium. Taken together, the growth of M-MOK might therefore be driven by a soluble factor, that is, GM-CSF secreted from HEL-O cells. The presence of HEL-O, however, inhibited anti-GM-CSF-induced M-MOK death. Co-culture of M-MOK and HEL-O cells thus offers a useful experimental model for analysis of interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and stromal cells.","['Itano, M', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Minegishi, N', 'Fujie, H', 'Minegishi, M', 'Morita, S', 'Yambe, T', 'Ohashi, Y', 'Masuda, T', 'Koike, T']","['Itano M', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Minegishi N', 'Fujie H', 'Minegishi M', 'Morita S', 'Yambe T', 'Ohashi Y', 'Masuda T', 'Koike T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lung', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Nov;23(12):1301-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the following antigens by immunocytochemical techniques: (i) the 180-kDa nucleolar isoform of DNA topoisomerase II; (ii) a 126-kDa polypeptide of nuclear bodies; (iii) a 125-kDa protein; and (iv) a 160-kDa polypeptide which are known to be components of the matrix inner network. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed to follow these nuclear matrix antigens during apoptosis. Moreover, the ultrastructural localization of both 125- and 160-kDa proteins was investigated by electron microscope immunocytochemistry with gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. While the antibody to the nucleolar isoform of DNA topoisomerase II gave a fluorescent pattern that was well-maintained until the late phases of apoptosis, the other three nuclear antigens showed marked modifications in their distribution. A common feature, particularly evident for 125- and 160-kDa proteins, was their absence from cap-shaped chromatin marginations, whereas they were present in the areas of remaining decondensed chromatin. The 126-kDa polypeptide concentrated progressively in an irregular mass at the opposite side of the crescentic caps and then broke up in fine spots. The 125- and 160-kDa proteins localized in the nucleolus and precisely within certain granules which are known to appear in the nucleolar area after camptothecin administration. These results show that, in addition to the well-known chromatin changes, nuclear organization undergoes other rearrangements during the apoptotic process.","['Zweyer, M', 'Bareggi, R', 'Grill, V', 'Soranzo, M R', 'Marugg, R A', 'Riederer, B M', 'Narducci, P', 'Martelli, A M']","['Zweyer M', 'Bareggi R', 'Grill V', 'Soranzo MR', 'Marugg RA', 'Riederer BM', 'Narducci P', 'Martelli AM']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/immunology/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/immunology/metabolism', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/enzymology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nuclear Matrix/enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*immunology/*metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71349-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1349 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Nov;221(1):27-40. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lymphoid cells, the effects of PMA and Ca2+ ionophore, singly or in combination, on activation and expression of Ca(2+)-dependent PKC at the level of protein and messenger RNA have been examined. Starting from these observations and the possibility that differential isoenzyme expression might contribute to the differences in phorbol ester sensitivity of lymphoid cells, it seemed worthwhile to investigate the expression and the modulation of PKC isoforms in KM-3 cells, a human pre-B cell line, upon treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Using multiparametric analysis we detected three PKC isoforms in the KM-3 cell line: alpha, beta II, and zeta. PMA treatment causes an intranuclear translocation of the beta II isoform, via the nuclear pore complex, associated with the interchromatinic regions. These data suggest that the beta II isoenzyme may play a strategic role in signal transduction and regulation of specific gene expression in B lymphocytes.","['Trubiani, O', 'Rana, R A', 'Stuppia, L', 'Di Primio, R']","['Trubiani O', 'Rana RA', 'Stuppia L', 'Di Primio R']","['Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Facolta di Medicina, Universita di Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71364-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1364 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Nov;221(1):172-8. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern and immuno-blot analyses revealed that the variant cells were deficient in the expression of a structural or a regulatory gene for Fc epsilon RI gamma subunit. The cells did not respond by release of secretagogues and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation to IgE and antigen and anti-Fc epsilon RI monoclonal antibody (mAb) but their response to anti-Thy-1.1 mAb and calcium ionophore A23187 was retained. Transfection of the cloned Fc epsilon RI gamma subunit into the variant cells restored the surface expression of Fc epsilon RI and responsiveness to both the antigen and anti-Fc epsilon RI mAb but had no effect on responsiveness to anti-Thy-1 mAb.

These results suggest that TCR-induced deletion of immature thymocytes in vitro is independent of CD95L. Thus, our data argue against a role of CD95L in negative selection of MHC-class I-restricted autoreactive thymocytes.","['Muller, K P', 'Mariani, S M', 'Matiba, B', 'Kyewski, B', 'Krammer, P H']","['Muller KP', 'Mariani SM', 'Matiba B', 'Kyewski B', 'Krammer PH']","['Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD4 Antigens', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Clonal Deletion', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology', 'Self Tolerance', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830251043 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Oct;25(10):2996-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830251043.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, elimination of such mIgE-positive cells should result in the suppression of IgE production, thereby alleviating the symptoms of IgE-mediated allergy. In this study, we examined, in a model system, whether IgE-specific effector T cells can be used specifically to eradicate IgE-producing B cells. To this end, we endowed T cells with anti-IgE specificity using chimeric T cell receptors (cTCR) containing the variable region domain (Fv) of the 84.1c non-anaphylactic anti-mouse IgE monoclonal antibody (mAb). Two configurations of chimeric receptor were used: in the first, we combined the heavy and light variable region chains of 84.1c with the constant (C) regions of the TCR alpha and beta chains. The second construct consisted of a chimeric single-chain receptor (scFvR), composed of a single-chain Fv region of the 84.1c antibody and the C beta domain of the TCR. Following transfection of the cTCR or the scFvR genes into the murine MD.45 cytotoxic T cell hybridoma or the Jurkat human T cell line, functional expression of IgE-specific chimeric receptors was detected on the cell surface. The transfected cells secreted interleukin-2 upon stimulation with immobilized IgE or fixed IgE-producing hybridoma cells. Moreover, cytotoxic T cell hybridomas expressing the chimeric receptor genes specifically eliminated IgE-secreting B cells in vitro, resulting in isotype-specific suppression of IgE production.","['Lustgarten, J', 'Eshhar, Z']","['Lustgarten J', 'Eshhar Z']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*genetics/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', '*Clonal Deletion', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/immunology/prevention & control', 'Immunoglobulin E/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830251041 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Oct;25(10):2985-91. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830251041.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rat Fc gamma RII analog of the mouse b2 isoform has been earlier identified and its transcript detected in RBL-2H3 cells. We have noew isolated and sequenced the rat Fc gamma RIIb1 isoform and observed differences between its expression in RBL-2H3 and RBL-gamma-. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rat mucosal mast cells express a second, low-affinity Fc gamma receptor, namely the Fc gamma RIII. Stimulation of either cell line with IgG complexes decreased the expression of transcripts for all Fc gamma R. Hence, ligation of Fc gamma R on rat mucosal mast cells apparently regulate their transcription. Selective stimulation through the Fc gamma RII or Fc gamma RII/III systems, respectively, was accomplished by either using RBL-gamma- line or by saturating the Fc epsilon RI on RBL-2H3 with monomeric IgE. RBL-gamma-cells, which do carry Fc gamma RII (but lack Fc epsilon RI and Fc gamma RIII), do not respond to IgG (and IgE) immune complexes as monitored by specific protein tyrosine phosphorylation, degranulation or cytokine secretion. This finding, together with the restoration of the functional phenotype of parental cells upon gamma chain cDNA transfection into RBL-gamma- cells, unequivocally excludes the possible stimulation of rat mucosal mast cells by clustering of their Fc gamma RII. Fc epsilon RI saturation by IgE on parental RBL-2H3 cells completely blocks their response to IgG immune complexes. Thus the Fc gamma R on these cells do not trigger degranulation and this is not due to the absence of Fc gamma RIII as previously suggested. Therefore, co-clustering of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII on rat mucosal mast cells does not seem to stimulate them. A possible inhibitory role of Fc gamma RII in this process is suggested and discussed.","['Bocek, P Jr', 'Draberova, L', 'Draber, P', 'Pecht, I']","['Bocek P Jr', 'Draberova L', 'Draber P', 'Pecht I']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucous Membrane/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/deficiency/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830251035 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Oct;25(10):2948-55. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830251035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that NKG2-C is expressed as a 36-kDa glycoprotein by translation in vitro, recombinant expression and immunoprecipitation from a human NK cell clone. Further, a recombinant soluble NKG2-C-receptor binds specifically to K562 cells, which are target cells for NK cell killing, and to RPMI 8866 cells, which are feeder cells for NK cells; several other hematopoietic cell lines tested do not show any binding. The binding structures on the surface of K562 cells disappear, concomitant with a loss in susceptibility to killing when the cells are induced to differentiate with phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore. Our data suggest the presence of specific target molecules for NKG2-C on K562 cells, since overall glycosylation, Lewis X and Lewis Y structures, as well as the mucin-like CD43 molecule, do not change following induction of the cells.

This effect has long been suspected to be due to glucocorticoid antagonism of GH action at the level of peripheral tissues. In the present study we demonstrate direct antagonism of GH action at the cellular level by the artificial glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was found to inhibit the ability of GH to elicit several early events in GH signaling in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Dexamethasone (100 nM) for 24 h decreases by 50-75% GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, the transcription factor Stat3/APRF, the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2, and the GH receptor. These effects appear to be specific to GH. Dexamethasone does not inhibit induction of tyrosyl phosphorylation of ERK proteins by epidermal growth factor or phorbol myristate acetate, nor does it block induction of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat3/APRF by leukemia inhibitory factor or interleukin-6, or induction of JAK2 by leukemia inhibitory factor or interferon-gamma. Dexamethasone does not decrease the expression of ERK1 or -2, Stat3, or JAK2 proteins. Rather, the effects of dexamethasone on GH action appear to be due to a decrease in the number of GH receptors in the plasma membrane. Twenty-four-hour treatment with dexamethasone leads to a 50% decrease i GH binding, which Scatchard analysis suggests is due to a decrease in GH receptor number. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids antagonize cellular GH action by decreasing GH binding, suggesting a mechanism by which systemic glucocorticoids could antagonize GH action in peripheral tissues.","['King, A P', 'Carter-Su, C']","['King AP', 'Carter-Su C']","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0622, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Growth Hormone/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.136.11.7588209 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1995 Nov;136(11):4796-803. doi: 10.1210/endo.136.11.7588209.,,,"['DK-48283/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-08322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 50 specimens with a suspected diagnosis of leukemia. Gates were set on the eight discrete clusters typically found in normal bone marrow. We employed these gates to determine the differential of the abnormal bone marrows.

This method provides a relatively easy and powerful tool which can be applied to all bone marrow specimens that undergo flow cytometric analysis. It can greatly enhance the identification and lineage assessment of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow.

The effectiveness of permeabilization was studied by propidium iodide staining, and the detectability of intracellular antigens was studied by using monoclonal antibodies toward two model antigens. Most of the lysing methods caused permeabilization of at least part of the leukocytes, but only one method, already found in our previous studies, was applicable for complete permeabilization of leukocytes and for detection of intracellular antigens alone or simultaneously with the cell surface antigens.","['Tiirikainen, M I']",['Tiirikainen MI'],"['Blood Transfusion Service, Finnish Red Cross, Helsinki.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry/*drug effects/immunology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Intracellular Fluid/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Peroxidase/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Solutions/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/blood']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990200410 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Aug 1;20(4):341-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990200410.,,['Cytometry. 1996 Jul 1;24(3):292-5.

The data were obtained using a quantitative fluorescence microscope and fluorescent ratio probes specific for [Ca2+]in (Fura-2-AM) and [pH]in (BCECF-AM). Results demonstrate that two types of target cell response to the attack by an NK cell can be distinguished. The target cell either dies immediately, due to the complete breakdown of the membrane impermeability, or the initial membrane damage (i.e., increased membrane permeability) is repaired and the cell ""escapes"" immediate death. During both responses an increase of [Ca2+]in takes place in the target cells. In the cells that die immediately, however, [Ca2+]in reaches higher levels (approximately 1,400 nM) than in the cells that restore the initial damage (approximately 700 nM). Changes in target cell [pH]in are also detected during both responses. The direction of the change (acidification or alkalinization) as well as the level of the change depend on extracellular pH ([pH]ex). Also, [pH]in remains changed during the time the cells were followed (10 min). The programming time (i.e., the time from the initiation of the cytotoxic process to the time that a change in the physiological parameter was detected) of the killing process that leads to an immediate target cell death appears to be shortest at [pH]ex 7.3-7.6 (approximately 3 min).","['Radosevic, K', 'de Grooth, B G', 'Greve, J']","['Radosevic K', 'de Grooth BG', 'Greve J']","['Department of Applied Physics, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '105344-37-4 (fura-2-am)', ""117464-70-7 (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl"", 'ester)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calibration', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Fura-2/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990200403 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Aug 1;20(4):281-9. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990200403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed, using fixed as well as living cells, the occurrence of (pseudo) emperipolesis during the interaction. About 30% of conjugated NK cells penetrated, partly or completely, into the target cells (in-conjugation). Virtually all in-conjugated target cells exhibited polymerized actin. Killer cells of in-conjugates were frequently seen approaching the target cell nucleus or aligning along it. If the cytotoxic process was inhibited by the absence of calcium neither actin polymerization nor in-conjugation were observed. A kinetic study showed that in-conjugation starts somewhat later than actin polymerization but still within a few minutes after addition of calcium to conjugates previously formed in the absence of calcium. The presence of cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin polymerization) completely inhibited in-conjugation and partly reduced the cytotoxic activity. Zinc ions (endonuclease inhibition) inhibited in-conjugation and decreased the total number of target cells with polymerized actin in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxic activity was also reduced but not as efficiently as in-conjugation. Our study demonstrates that in-conjugation represents a significant fraction of the cytotoxic interaction. The results indicate that it may be a consequence of an actin polymerization and endonuclease activity dependent part of a cytotoxic mechanism.","['Radosevic, K', 'van Leeuwen, A M', 'Segers-Nolten, I M', 'Figdor, C G', 'de Grooth, B G', 'Greve, J']","['Radosevic K', 'van Leeuwen AM', 'Segers-Nolten IM', 'Figdor CG', 'de Grooth BG', 'Greve J']","['Department of Applied Physics, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biopolymers', 'Calcium/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Sulfates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology', 'Zinc Sulfate']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990200402 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Aug 1;20(4):273-80. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990200402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on cell type, this DNA cleavage proceeds from 300 and 50kbp fragments prior to, concomitantly with, or in the absence of 180bp integer fragmentation. Incorporation into fragmented DNA of biotin-labelled nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) has recently become a standard flow cytometric assay for the identification and quantitation of apoptosis. Nucleotide incorporation is visualized using avidin-tagged fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Gorczyca et al.: Cancer Res 53:1945-1951, 1993; Jonker et al.: Cytometry (Suppl 13):Abstr 99A, 1993). Here, we characterise this assay further in three different haemopoietic cell lines. Drug-induced DNA damage is not identified by the TdT assay unless it is coupled to the apoptotic response. This was demonstrated using cells in which activation of the oncogenic Abelson-encoded protein tyrosine kinase suppressed drug-induced apoptosis, but did not inhibit drug-induced DNA damage (by melphalan, hydroxyurea, or etoposide). Furthermore, the TdT assay identifies DNA fragments formed during apoptosis induced by etoposide and N-methylformamide in HL60 and MOLT-4 cells, including those high molecular weight DNA fragments formed in MOLT-4 cells which were not further cleaved to 180-200bp integer fragments.

The aim of the study was to compare binding properties of anti-Pgp antibodies reacting with surface (MRK16, UIC2) and cytoplasmic (C219, JSB-1) epitopes to assess which antibody performed best with respect to fluorescence discrimination. By histogram subtraction the fractions of resistant human hepatoma cells positive for Pgp were 99% (MRK16), 97% (UIC2), 77% (JSB-1), and 51% (C219), demonstrating variations in antibody reactivity. The resolution in detecting decreasing levels of Pgp in hepatoma cells was superior for the externally binding antibodies, showing that there is a correlation between antibody reactivity and fluorescence discrimination. Similar results were obtained for parental and resistant KG1a human leukemia cell lines. The Pgp epitopes remained reactive to the anti-Pgp MAbs after methanol fixation and cryopreservation. By dual parameter flow cytometry it was shown that Pgp expression in viable cells may be assessed together with uptake of epirubicin, which was low in cells expressing high levels of Pgp and vice versa. In conclusion, all tested antibodies proved useful for flow cytometric detection of high levels of Pgp, but the externally binding ones were superior in detection of low and variable levels of Pgp.","['Lehne, G', 'De Angelis, P', 'Clausen, O P', 'Egeland, T', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Rugstad, H E']","['Lehne G', 'De Angelis P', 'Clausen OP', 'Egeland T', 'Tsuruo T', 'Rugstad HE']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, National Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibody Diversity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990200306 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Jul 1;20(3):228-37. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990200306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
